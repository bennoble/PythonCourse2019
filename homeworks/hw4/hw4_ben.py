As n increases, the gnome sort tends to take an increasingly long time. This makes sense given that 
it moves backwards within the list. The gnome sort is also more variableâ€”if the randomly generated list 
is nearly in order, it will go quickly versus if the list is very out of order. The heapsort is mostly 
invariant to the starting shuffle and list size.
