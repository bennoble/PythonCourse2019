Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,Minimum wage proponents hold slim hope Sununu will sign bill,"Jul 1, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/business/minimum-wage-proponents-hold-slim-hope-sununu-will-sign-bill/article_7ea35458-b497-54c4-b966-8f700fdef425.html,"CONCORD — A proposal to raise New Hampshire’s minimum wage to $12 an hour by 2022 awaits a decision by Gov. Chris Sununu, who is expected to veto the bill despite an ongoing effort by supporters who say they will continue to push for a higher minimum in the Granite State.SB 10 calls for the state minimum wage to increase from $7.25 currently to $10 per hour in 2020, then another increase to $12 per hour in 2022. The bill passed both the New Hampshire House and Senate despite not having a single Republican in either chamber vote in its favor.That leaves its fate up to Sununu, a Republican who has said he thinks the minimum wage should be left to federal discretion. Although a veto remained likely, supporters of SB 10 are hoping Sununu signs the bill rather than veto it.“There’s always hope,” said Rep. Brian Sullivan, chairman of the House Labor Committee.Sullivan is among a handful of state lawmakers who have agreed to participate in what they are calling the “minimum wage challenge” — attempting to live for a week on a budget based on an income of the current state minimum, which is also the national rate. They have also invited Sununu to join them, although the governor thus far has not accepted the invitation to join the challenge, which begins next week.“If he did, perhaps he would better understand the dilemma of low wage workers,” Sullivan said.Sununu spokesman Ben Vihstadt said Monday that SB 10, which only passed the Senate last week, has not reached the governor’s desk yet. When it does, Vihstadt said Sununu will have five business days to sign it, issue a veto or let the bill become law without a signature.A veto appeared to remain the most likely choice. “As Gov. Sununu has long stated, he opposes a state minimum wage, believing it should be set at the federal level,” Vihstadt said in statement. “With record low unemployment, some of the highest median incomes in the country, and the lowest poverty rate in the nation, New Hampshire’s economic model is a success story.”Supporters of the increase say it’s necessary for New Hampshire to keep up with its neighbors. New Hampshire’s minimum wage is at least $3 lower than the current minimum in the neighboring states of Maine, Vermont and Massachusetts. Maine’s minimum wage increased to $11 per hour on Jan. 1 and goes up to $12 hourly next year. Massachusetts has a $12 minimum wage and Vermont’s is currently $10.78, a rate that state law calls for increasing annually for inflation with the Consumer Price Index. All three neighboring states have adjusted minimums for service or tipped employees with lower hourly rates plus a tip credit.Under SB 10, New Hampshire would set the wage for tipped employees at 45% of the minimum wage, with tipped employees guaranteed to earn at least $12 for all hours worked at the end of each pay period.Opponents have maintained that SB 10 would hurt small businesses in the Granite State.Sullivan said it would also help a great deal of people who can’t afford basic living costs at the current minimum. Although many Granite Staters are well above the minimum with jobs averaging in the $10-$12 hourly range, Sullivan said too many others fall well below that threshold.That’s one of the reasons Sullivan said he agreed to join some of his colleagues, who introduced the challenge at a news conference Monday with a number of organizations that have been helping push for the higher minimum wage. Rep. Mark King, Rep. Kris Schultz and Sen. Dan Feltes also signed on to participate in the challenge, which begins July 8.“It can get complex,” Sullivan said. “Part of it is simply researching and coming to grips with what it would be like to be a low wage worker or minimum wage worker.”Sullivan said he expected finding housing he could afford at those wages would be difficult, if not impossible, and leave little to cover other essentials — like food.Sullivan recalled being a newlywed and keeping a running tab with a calculator as he and his wife shopped for groceries.“If we couldn’t afford it all we’d put some stuff back,” he said. “I think we might be back to that next week.”If Sununu does veto SB 10, Sullivan said both the House and Senate retained bills that can be brought right back up in next year’s session.“We’re hoping the governor will sign this one,” Sullivan said."
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,Child advocate to kids from juvenile justice system: We need your voice,"Jun 30, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/social_issues/child-advocate-to-kids-from-juvenile-justice-system-we-need/article_f50793ce-b760-50ab-9c17-47138a887292.html,"As New Hampshire looks to reform its juvenile justice system, Moira O’Neill says she wants to hear from the real experts: kids who have been in that system.O’Neill, director of the state Office of the Child Advocate, plans a listening tour this summer to meet with kids who live in group homes. She also wants to enlist their participation in a youth advocacy group to help guide policymakers.“We want to hear from the kids,” O’Neill said. “Getting their stories is key.”“You really have to engage people regardless of their age when you’re trying to help them. They have to be a big part of it,” she said.O’Neill recently brought together a roomful of stakeholders to talk about new efforts to bring more community-based, family-centered services into the system to replace out-of-home placements. And some of the most powerful voices in the room belonged to teenagers who know how it feels when the system fails them.Allie Reyes, 19, who is heading to the University of New Hampshire this fall, said she was in and out of placements for four years, including time spent in the former Youth Development Center in Manchester. She told O’Neill that some of the employees back then would “bet” on the prospects for youngsters leaving detention: “You’re going to be back in two weeks.”There were gasps from adults in the room, and murmurs of sympathy. “How do we hold workers accountable for what they say?” Reyes asked. “It is hard to work on yourself when you’re constantly being devalued.”O’Neill thanked her for speaking up. “It’s a testament to your resilience that you’d be so forgiving and be here to help us figure this out,” she told her.Six young women from the Davenport School, a residential program in Jefferson, made the two-hour trip south to hear what the adults had to say. When it was time for audience questions, they shared their frustrations and begged policymakers to find ways to keep kids out of the system to begin with. Some said it wasn’t their fault they ended up in placements, coming from homes with abuse or substance use issues.One student talked about being in a foster home for more than three years, going to school “with bruises all over me,” and winding up in the YDC, now the Sununu Youth Services Center in Manchester. “I’m very sorry for the experience you’ve had,” O’Neill told her.Another teen said she had a positive experience in foster care, but urged state leaders to do more to improve pay and benefits for those who care for vulnerable children. “I’m here to advocate for the staff that work at those placements,” she said. “They’re raising the future of New Hampshire.”In response to their comments, O’Neill told the students, “I want to make it clear to you that people in this room and beyond really care about all of you. You are important to the state of New Hampshire, and we’re going to figure this out.”O’Neill also told the teens about the youth advocacy group her office wants to create. She offered to visit their school to meet with them, or use technology to hold regular virtual meetings. “We have a lot to learn from you guys,” she said.At the Concord meeting, Patrick McCarthy and Jane Tewksbury from Youth Correctional Leaders for Justice shared their insights about how the state might restructure services for its youngest and most vulnerable citizens. The two, both former juvenile corrections commissioners, have been talking with folks who are involved in child welfare and justice programs here about the challenges and opportunities facing the state.New Hampshire is well-positioned to become a national model for restructuring its juvenile justice system, the two told the roomful of advocates, lawmakers, providers and case managers. But that will mean bringing all voices — including those of youngsters — into the conversation.New Hampshire always ranks at or near the top in the annual Kids Count report on child well-being from the Annie E. Casey Foundation, Tewksbury noted. And she said, “You are poised to be a national model of systems change.”New Hampshire previously had a national reputation for its top-quality child welfare system and home-based prevention services, McCarthy said. “And then the recession hit,” he said.Budget cuts weakened or pared back critical services, and froze rates that providers are paid, he said. “Lots of folks I talked to suggested that some for the challenges you’re taking up now can be traced back to the reduction in support for those services,” he said. “I think that’s an important lesson to remember, because these things are cyclical.”New Hampshire has a relatively high rate of out-of-home placements, currently about 400 kids, McCarthy said, which “can be traced back to the deterioration of your alternatives to that system.” While most states have 11 to 12 percent of their youth caseloads in group settings, in New Hampshire, it’s more like 20 to 30 percent, he said.And that’s a lot more expensive than providing services in homes and local communities, he said. He has worked with other states, McCarthy said, that were able to cut the number of residential placements by 20 to 40 percent in just a few years, saving money that can be used instead for community-based, intensive services.One “sticking point” here, he said, is the future of the Sununu Youth Services Center, the former YDC in Manchester. Built with a capacity for 144 beds, it now has a population of about 20 youngsters, some held for detention and others for incarceration. And with an annual budget of $10.8 million, McCarthy said, that amounts to a staggering annual cost of $540,000 per youngster.With such a small caseload, New Hampshire could take the opportunity to target intensive, individualized services for those youngsters instead, McCarthy said.Tewksbury agreed having such a small number of youngsters at the Sununu center is an advantage. “It is a small group, and it makes it easier to get your arms around them, both figuratively and literally,” she said.It also affords an opportunity to work backward, to see “what parts of the system might have made a difference in keeping that child on track,” she said, such as access to mental health or substance abuse services.With the passage of Senate Bill 14, which Gov. Chris Sununu signed into law on June 3, the state plans to expand behavioral health services for children, including mobile response and stabilization care for children in crisis. The bill also requires the state to establish a care management system for youngsters with behavioral health challenges; set up a family support clearinghouse; and require assessments and screenings for kids in court-ordered placements.The goal, O’Neill said, is to reduce reliance on institutions and shift those resources to a community-based system of care for all children.Karen Cusano, assistant executive director of NFI North, which runs Davenport School, urged officials to find a way to support such programs into the future. In a state with a two-year budget cycle, she said, “We need to solidify this for the long term so the next time the Legislature changes, we’re not reversing back to what it was before.”And McCarthy urged officials here not to squander any dollars saved by reducing the population at the Sununu center. “Don’t let them go into roads,” he said. “The kids need that money. They need it for earlier interventions.”At the end of the two-hour meeting, one Davenport student asked a poignant question: “How can we trust you guys when we’ve been failed so many times by the system?”O’Neill’s reply: “Come and sit with us at the table.”Her job as child advocate is to look out for all the kids of New Hampshire, she told the teens. “But we would be more effective if we had your eyes as well.”swickham@unionleader.com"
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,Former FEMA Director/NH DOT Commissioner passes away,"Jun 29, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/politics/national/former-fema-director-nh-dot-commissioner-passes-away/article_aa19509b-be2b-5dc7-93da-abd7771238cf.html,"SALEM — Wally Stickney, 85, who held a myriad of roles in local, state and federal government over a 30-year-plus career, died this past week, according to family and friends.













Wally Stickney, 85 (shown here with Gov. Chris Sununu), died last week, which brought out memories of his long service in local, state and federal government roles.


COURTESY



Stickney served as director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency under former President George H.W. Bush.Closer to home, Stickney became much better known as a New Hampshire public servant, his service including a stretch as commissioner of the Department of Transportation.Stickney will be remembered at DOT as someone who fought passionately for highway construction projects like widening Interstate 93 over the opposition of environmentalists who wanted to block the work due to the filling in of wetlands.Gov. Chris Sununu confirmed the news. Stickney for decades had been a close personal friend and political ally to Sununu’s father, former Gov. and former White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu.“With the passing of Wally Stickney of Salem, I and all we Sununus have lost a great friend of many years,” the governor tweeted. “Wally was a true gentleman and one of the finest public servants ever. He will be always remembered and missed.”Like the elder Sununu, Stickney was a trained engineer who graduated from New England College and later received master’s degrees from Harvard and Northeastern Universities.As John H. Sununu was making a name for himself in Salem politics, Stickney was serving as town engineer.Once John Sununu first became governor in 1982, Stickney came aboard as the governor’s special adviser on environmental issues.Ed Lecius of Nashua had served as an aide in Sununu’s office and later went to Washington with Stickney.“I remember he shared an office with Norm Vandernoot and while I was waiting to go in and meet with Gov. John Sununu, Wally went out of his way to make me feel comfortable,” Lecius recalled. “(This is) a true loss to all of us who knew him and worked with him! I had the honor to work for him at FEMA during Bush 41 and his compassion for the victims was often lost in the mainstream media.”At FEMA, Stickney presided over a time when the agency’s budget was significantly cut because so much of it had dealt with plans for how to survive a nuclear war with the Soviet Union.“The evil empire had crumbled, the Warsaw Pact nations were becoming independent, and it became clear that the most difficult situation we would have to handle wouldn’t be a maximum lay-down but a partial one, in which only a part of the country was knocked out,” Stickney said at the time. “It was a time of transition on the world scene.”After leaving the federal government in 1993, Stickney became the chairman and senior associate of Municipal Resources Inc., a company that provides personnel and other support to local and county agencies in the state.Stickney frequently stepped into the breach: Among the roles he took on while permanent replacements were found include interim fire chief of Hudson as well as both interim public works director and interim director of the local airport for the city of Lebanon.“Wally was a wonderful man, the Stickneys a great family. May he rest in peace,” said New Hampshire Fire Marshal Paul Parisi.Last year Stickney became the first recipient of the Sununu-Roy Public Service Legacy Award for career public service.In 2017, Nancy Stickney, his wife of 62 years, passed away. Mrs. Stickney had devoted decades of her own life to civic causes including four years in the New Hampshire House of Representatives.klandrigan@unionleader.com"

            Your Turn, NH: Sens. Chuck Morse, Jeb Bradley -- It's time for a bipartisan budget that works for everyone

EDITOR’S NOTE: This was written before Gov. Chris Sununu’s Friday afternoon budget veto. 




Unless Sununu wants to be known as the governor who lost the New Hampshire Advantage, he may have to lose some of his current immense popularity and stand strong.Be sure to read the commentary on the facing page today by state Sens. Chuck Morse and Jeb Bradley.Their work on recent budgets helped erase an $800 million deficit that Democrat Gov. Maggie Hassan had produced. And they rescued the state from a ranking of 48th worst in business taxes.Morse and Bradley nicely sum up what’s wrong with the Democrats’ budget and what Gov. Sununu cannot give away in any summer compromise.It “increases overall spending by over 13% that creates a deficit for the next budget, it increases taxes on New Hampshire businesses and employers, and resurrects dreaded donor towns to fund education.”“These three problems,” they write, “need to be resolved in order for a bipartisan budget to be developed. A 13% increase in spending is not realistic nor is it necessary to dedicate significant resources to mental health, substance abuse, families with disabled children, prevention of child abuse and neglect, freezing college tuition and increasing K-12 education funding. A 13% increase in spending is not sustainable and inevitably leads to a sales or income tax.”This is a key moment for New Hampshire. Taxpayers need to let Gov. Sununu and Republican legislators know that if they play nice now with the Democrats, they will regret it forever."

Chuck Morse, Jeb Bradley -- It's time for a bipartisan budget that works for everyone","Jun 29, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/opinion/columnists/your-turn-nh-sens-chuck-morse-jeb-bradley--/article_db0a1621-0452-5619-a8e1-1b16981546ae.html,"EDITOR’S NOTE: This was written before Gov. Chris Sununu’s Friday afternoon budget veto.OUR FRIENDS Senate President Donna Soucy and House Speaker Steve Shurtleff recently penned an editorial, “A Budget that Puts Hard Working Families First.” Their central theme is that hardworking families need evermore government programs, which must come at the expense of employers and job creators in New Hampshire. We disagree with their view and hope Governor Sununu will veto this budget so that a realistic bipartisan budget can be adopted.We have had the privilege of working to develop the prior four budgets, which were shaped by our belief that the best social program is a good job with benefits. Our theme has always been that budgets must grow the economy, protect taxpayers and dedicate the resources that New Hampshire needs to solve problems.The proof of those four budgets is in the pudding. New Hampshire now enjoys one of the lowest unemployment rates in the nation, the lowest poverty rate and among the highest per capita income rate in America. Our strong economy has produced record revenue that has been dedicated to upgrades of mental health, substance abuse and other initiatives. It’s no wonder U.S. News and World Report just ranked New Hampshire as the second “Best State” in America based on a series of metrics that include the economy, health care, education, crime and opportunity.But it was not always so. The first budget we developed in 2011 had to make difficult decisions to resolve an $800 million inherited deficit. We stopped raiding dedicated funds and no longer bonded already bonded expenses — tactics commonplace in the 2009 Legislature. We worked to repeal the LLC tax and taxes on business owners’ salaries because business owners were targets of solving New Hampshire’s deficit spending.As budgets stabilized, we worked to lower New Hampshire’s 48th-worst-in-the-nation level of business taxes. We also worked to lower workers compensation and unemployment insurance costs, setting reasonable spending levels and reducing regulatory barriers.If the best social program is indeed a good job, then New Hampshire residents now have the opportunity to work and have growing paychecks.So why are we opposing the budget supported by Senator Soucy and Representative Shurtleff? In our view three fundamental problems exist in their budget that will undermine the strong economy and raise burdens on taxpayers.The Soucy-Shurtleff budget increases overall spending by over 13% that creates a deficit for the next budget, it increases taxes on New Hampshire businesses and employers and it resurrects dreaded donor towns to fund education.These three problems need to be resolved in order for a bipartisan budget to be developed. A 13% increase in spending is not realistic nor is it necessary to dedicate significant resources to mental health, substance abuse, families with disabled children, prevention of child abuse and neglect, freezing college tuition and increasing K-12 education funding. A 13% increase in spending is not sustainable and inevitably leads to a sales or income tax.The Soucy-Shurtleff budget is not an answer for 35 towns from Portsmouth to Hanover that will actually lose education-funding dollars.At a minimum, this return of donor towns needs to have a hold-harmless provision to protect residents in those communities.This budget lastly needs to enhance, not undermine, the strong economy by maintaining the more competitive business tax policy. Soucy and Shurtleff dismissively refer to this policy as “giveaways for a small group of big out-of-state businesses.” They conveniently forget that virtually all New Hampshire job creators large and small have benefited. As businesses have benefited, so too have the 750,000 hardworking New Hampshire people they employ who benefit with growing paychecks and better opportunities.The New Hampshire treasury has also benefited with over $500 million of revenue above projections since business tax reductions occurred.They also conveniently forget that this legislative session has witnessed a range of anti-business measures that will increase electricity costs, workers compensation costs, unemployment insurance costs and many other initiatives that will make it harder for business to function.They also conveniently forget that their colleagues have tried on multiple occasions to implement an income tax and a capital gains tax.This budget — in fact this entire legislative session — is a false choice that raising taxes and increasing regulations on business is necessary to pay for expanded government programs.New Hampshire citizens want an economy that is growing so that their paychecks and opportunities are growing. They expect cost- effective government that solves problems without constantly increasing burdens on taxpayers.New Hampshire citizens understand that there must be a partnership with New Hampshire employers, not the adversarial relationship that has developed since the last election. They recognize an adversarial relationship only hurts them in the pocketbook.For all of these reasons, Governor Sununu should veto the budget so the work of creating a bipartisan budget that does indeed help all New Hampshire citizens can be developed."

Chris Sununu vetoed the $13 billion, two-year state budget Friday, concluding it contained unsustainable increases in state spending and “job killing tax increases.”The move, while expected, came near the close of business and after some anxious moments as the two-term chief executive was left waiting to receive the budget until just before 5 p.m.Obviously, Sununu wanted to get the budget veto settled before the weekend since the state’s fiscal year ends on Sunday.“As governor sometimes you have to make the tough decisions,” Sununu said in a video he posted on Facebook and Twitter.“I just vetoed the Legislature’s proposed budget because with today’s $260 million surplus it doesn’t make any sense to be raising taxes.”The two-term Newfields Republican said he had signed a 90-day continuing resolution to keep government operating until a compromise can be reached later this summer.“Until we get there, state government will remain open, services will be delivered and we’ll keep working together to get the job done,” Sununu added.Democratic legislative leaders condemned Sununu’s veto.For days, Sununu had been forecasting this action because while the Democratic-controlled Legislature yielded to some of his demands, they insisted on repealing cuts to the state’s two main business taxes.Senate Majority Leader Dan Feltes, D-Concord, said the veto was the act of an autocratic, stubborn leader.“With so many crises facing our children, our families, and our state, Governor Sununu’s veto of an entire state budget over one issue he didn’t ‘win’ on is just not the New Hampshire way. It is reckless, tone-deaf, and Trumpian,” said Feltes who is weighing his own Democratic primary bid for governor in 2020. “Our families, our economy, and our property tax payers all deserve better. They deserve a budget.”Senate Finance Chairman Lou D’Allesandro, D-Manchester, said he had worked with Sununu and his staff to try and find common ground.“The House and Senate listened to the governor and the people of New Hampshire and built a budget that helps everyone. The budget vetoed by Governor Sununu today did more for cities and towns than any budget in the last ten years while enacting meaningful business tax reform,” D’Allesandro said.“The governor let this opportunity go by with the stroke of one red pen today simply because he wanted his way. That’s not what cooperative government is all about.”Fiscally conservative and business groups praised Sununu for standing his ground.“Turning back the clock and raising business taxes to 2018 levels is bad for the economy, especially considering state revenue since the first business tax reductions in FY16 has exceeded $450 million,” said Jim Roche, president of the Business and Industry Association of New Hampshire.“We urge budget negotiators to return to the bargaining table.”Some of the additional spending in this budget for child protection, mental health and addiction recovery had Sununu’s blessing.But Sununu said it would have created a structural deficit of more than $90 million in future budgets and could force lawmakers in later years to “pull the rug” out from cities and towns that would now stand to gain millions in additional state aid from this plan.“Unlike Washington, our state does not and should never pass unbalanced budgets. Taking out a big mortgage with a one-time bonus from work would be a terrible decision but that is precisely what this budget does,” Sununu summed up.klandrigan@unionleader.com"
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,"Sununu Supreme Court pick shaky, Democrat councilor opposes MacDonald","Jun 28, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/education/sununu-supreme-court-pick-shaky-democrat-councilor-opposes-macdonald/article_23a11440-23c9-5f29-ae4f-a6b0f8440a5a.html,"CONCORD — Attorney General Gordon MacDonald’s bid to become chief justice of the New Hampshire Supreme Court looked to be on shaky ground Friday after a one-term Democrat on the Executive Council announced his opposition.Gov. Chris Sununu needs at least one Democrat on the five-person council to support MacDonald to replace Chief Justice Robert Lynn who is reaching the mandatory retirement age.Michael Cryans, a Hanover Democrat, did not issue a statement to the state’s media but told his local newspaper, The Valley News, that he’d oppose MacDonald. This was the day after Sununu’s pick received overwhelmingly support from the legal community at a public hearing.No judicial experienceCryans noted MacDonald seeks to become the first chief justice in a century to lead the judiciary without having any experience on the bench at any level in the court system.All three of Sununu’s picks for the highest court also had no judicial background.“In fairness to Gordon, he’s a hard-working attorney general. He’s bright, but on the issues, we just have a disagreement,” Cryans said. “And ... I’d like to have the governor, if this one doesn’t succeed, look at people with trial judge experience.”Many observers now question whether fellow Democratic Councilors Debora Pignatelli of Nashua and Andru Volinsky of Concord will follow suit and oppose MacDonald.During the nomination hearing, Volinsky observed that MacDonald had not applied for the chief justice post but a vacant seat on the court and MacDonald admitted he had never tried a case in front of a jury.Some Democratic legal activists maintain at a minimum that Gary Hicks, 66, of Manchester, the senior justice on the court, should get to become its chief.Sununu, a two-term Republican, didn’t take the news well and condemned Cryans for it.“Washington style politics have entered New Hampshire in the worst way possible,” Sununu said.“Councilor Cryans owes an apology to every single one of his North Country constituents for this shameful and blatantly partisan vote. Rarely has New Hampshire seen a nominee so well regarded with unprecedented and unanimous bipartisan support from lawyers, justices, legal assistance and victims rights advocates.”Soured relationship?Despite the Democratic majority, Sununu has enjoyed a pretty good relationship with this council.For six years, Sununu served on the council representing District 3, which consists of much of Rockingham County.What remains to be seen is whether this judicial fight will sour those relations.“They all fall victim to pure partisan politics,” Sununu said. “It is a sad day when an individual like Attorney General Gordon MacDonald, one of our state’s pre-eminent legal experts, is treated in such a disrespectful and shamefully partisan manner.”A spokesman for the New Hampshire Democratic Party said Sununu has only himself to blame.“Sununu is right about one thing. There is something unprecedented about his nominee for the highest court — that he has no judicial experience and instead is a Republican operative and notably a Sununu donor who was involved throughout his career in pushing strident anti-choice policies,” said Communications Director Holly Shulman. “His nominee raises serious questions about Sununu’s own position on abortion.”Sununu supports abortion rights but opponents noted MacDonald had represented the Catholic Diocese of Manchester and was a delegate in the 2016 election cycle committed to Florida Sen. Marco Rubio who opposes abortion rights.During his hearing, MacDonald said the landmark Roe vs. Wade decision legalizing abortion was “settled law” and as chief justice he would have a “duty to uphold it.”But Cryans, Volinsky and Pignatelli have pointed out that socially conservative groups have promoted legislation restricting abortion so this is an important topic to consider.Republican State Chairman Stephen Stepanek accused Democratic leaders of targeting MacDonald because as attorney general he had prosecuted then- Senate Democratic Leader Jeff Woodburn of Dalton on domestic violence charges. The case remains pending before a judge in Coos County Superior Court.“Let’s be clear: Councilor Cryans voted to block Attorney General Gordon MacDonald to the New Hampshire Supreme Court because he had the integrity to prosecute and file charges against disgraced North Country State Sen. Jeff Woodburn,” Stepanek said.“This unprecedented vote of obstruction is Councilor Cryans’ way of paying back his dues to Ray Buckley and the Democratic machine, who are still reeling from losing the North Country Senate seat last election. Today’s announcement of Cryans’ intended vote sends a chilling message to those who have the courage to take on entrenched politicians who are accused of misconduct.”Democratic spokesman Shulman had a pithy response to the state GOP.“What even is this? Do better,” Shulman said.During the 2016 campaign, Democratic Party Chairman Raymond Buckley and all but one of his fellow Senate Democrats urged Woodburn to resign from the Senate and not seek reelection.He lost last November to novice candidate David Starr.Several jurists testified in support of MacDonald, including former state Supreme Court justices Carol Ann Conboy and John Broderick, and Lynn.Dozens of lawyers including some prominent Democrats signed a letter supporting him.Among those testifying against him were those questioning his views on abortion as well as others critical of his defending Sununu’s positions on legislation to strengthen voter registration laws.The council was expected to vote on this pick at its next meeting July 10.klandrigan@unionleader.com"

Chris Sununu for a conversation with employees of the Grappone Automotive Group in Bow about Sununu’s Recovery Friendly Workplace initiative.“One of the things that I deeply resonate with is if you’re functioning in a place of shame, you can’t get anything done,” said Grappone owner Amanda Grappone Osmer, whose business was an early adopter of the governor’s initiative.“If you can’t feel good waking up in the morning about who you are as a person, the rest of what happens out there doesn’t matter. You won’t know what your potential is.”Launched in 2018, the Recovery Friendly Workplace initiative aims to provide businesses with the tools, training and resources to support employees struggling with substance misuse as they work toward recovery.“When we talk about recovery and treatment, that’s wonderful,” said Sununu of the initiative. “But treatment is not 28 days and then goodbye and good luck. It’s about getting a job, having self-worth and having those wrap-around services.”Carroll, who had the opportunity to speak to Grappone employees who have benefited from the company’s open-door approach to supporting workers in need of recovery support, said the initiative helps to confront the stigmatization that can keep many from speaking up and seeking treatment.“Allowing people to come forward and say ‘I have an addiction’, or like we saw today, with parents and family members coming and saying, ‘I have a child that needs help, I need time away from work for a few days because I need to help them’,” said Carroll.In praising praising Sununu’s Recovery Friendly Workplace initiative, Carroll told attendees about a family member of his who worried about job loss while attempting to seek treatment for prescription opioid dependence.“The world changed that day when we had to get a family member into detox. There wasn’t an Amanda in our life,” said Carroll.While much of the day’s focus dealt with opioids, Carroll noted that his department is monitoring a nationwide rise in the usage of methamphetamine.Although the drug is typically associated with localized production in meth labs within the United States, Carroll told the Union Leader that officials are seeing an uptick in high potency methamphetamine being produced by Mexican cartels.He went on to say that keeping it out of the country coincides with the Trump Administration’s goals for increased border security.“Methamphetamine, which is beginning to take a little bit of foothold here in the state for the first time, is very concerning. All of the meth that is in the US, almost all of it comes from Mexico,” said Carroll.“We have to stop the poison from coming in and killing our kids. That has to be one of the things that we think about everyday.”"
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,"Minimum wage, gun-free school zone bills headed for Sununu's desk","Jun 27, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/politics/state/minimum-wage-gun-free-school-zone-bills-headed-for-sununu/article_2d0a9178-adec-5fc6-9561-d043f9eac2a9.html,"CONCORD — In the last day of regular session voting, the Democratic House and Senate passed bills raising the minimum wage and establishing gun-free school zones throughout the state.The vote was 14-10 in the Senate and 207-143 in the House. Both bills passed without a single Republican vote, and are facing likely vetoes from Republican Gov. Chris Sununu.SB 10 raises New Hampshire’s minimum wage, now at $7.25, to $10 per hour in 2020 and $12 per hour in 2022.It sets the wage for tipped employees at 45% of the minimum wage, with tipped employees guaranteed to earn at least $12 for all hours worked at the end of each pay period.New Hampshire’s minimum wage is at least $3 lower than the current minimum in neighboring Maine, Vermont and Massachusetts.“New Hampshire is the only state in New England that still allows the federal government to set our minimum wage,” said Rep. Brian Sullivan, D-Grantham. “This legislation was a priority of both the House and Senate … and I urge Gov. Sununu to sign it into law.”House Republican Leader Dick Hinch, R-Merrimack, said the bill, if allowed to become law, would hurt the state’s small businesses.“This bill is kicking them while they’re down, and House Republicans will strongly support a veto by Gov. Sununu,” he said.Gun-free school zonesIn another set of party-line votes, the House and Senate passed HB 564, establishing gun-free school zones across the state.“This legislation is vital to improving safety at our schools and helping to guard against the type of mass-shooting tragedies that are taking place too frequently across the United States,” said House Majority Leader Doug Ley, D-Jaffrey.HB 564 forbids unauthorized individuals from carrying guns into schools, with exceptions for law enforcement, school resource officers, on-duty members of the armed forces and other individuals authorized by the school board to carry firearms on school grounds.Parents picking up kids are permitted to carry a firearm on school grounds provided it remains in the motor vehicle.Republicans argued that the measure will make schools less safe, and potentially subject otherwise law-abiding citizens to misdemeanor charges.Other billsAlso headed to Sununu’s desk are the following bills:SB 290, which changes the work requirement in the expanded Medicaid program, known as the Granite Advantage Health Care Program. The bill gives DHHS Commissioner Jeffrey Meyers broad authority to waive the work requirement.HB 582, relative to the regional greenhouse gas initiative. This bill assigns some of the revenue from the state’s participation in the RGGI carbon cap and trade program to subsidize energy efficiency programs. All the proceeds from RGGI are currently going into rate relief for electricity ratepayers.SB 82, relative to food and nutrition programs in schools. This bill fully reimburses school districts for reduced priced breakfast when students are unable to contribute the 30-cent cost.SB 279, relative to access to fertility care. This bill requires insurance carriers in the small and large group insurance markets to cover diagnosis of infertility, access to fertility treatments and preservation of fertility for those who are facing the loss of future fertility due to medical treatments like chemotherapy.dsolomon@unionleader.com"
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,Stage set for Sununu budget veto; both sides seek compromise,"Jun 27, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/politics/state/stage-set-for-sununu-budget-veto-both-sides-seek-compromise/article_cfad65d3-5a5d-5e05-8dfa-6df278cbd865.html,"CONCORD — A $13 billion state budget that adds millions in new spending on education, child protection, mental health and addiction recovery passed the House and Senate along party lines on Thursday without a single Republican vote in either chamber.The 14-10 vote in the Senate and 209-144 vote in the House send the spending and revenue plan for the next two fiscal years to Republican Gov. Chris Sununu, who has his veto pen at the ready.In anticipation of that veto, the first order of business in both chambers was to pass on a voice vote a continuing resolution, authorizing state departments and agencies to continue operating at existing funding levels, until an agreement on the new budget is reached.The state’s current two-year budget expires on June 30, while the continuing resolution will expire on Oct. 1.Sununu met with House Speaker Steve Shurtleff, D-Concord, and Senate President Donna Soucy, D-Manchester, on Wednesday to discuss the continuing resolution and to ensure that it would not contain any amendments that would derail the measure.“We have a clean continuing resolution and government programs will continue,” Sununu said. “That’ll give us some time to take a couple of weeks and revisit some of the key points of contention in the budget, which are not all that severe and are not insurmountable.”Sununu says he is confident the two sides will come to a deal before the three-month window closes, based on his negotiations with House and Senate leadership.“We’re all working very productively together; it’s been a good relationship. There’s not a lot of contention in the room, which gives me a lot of hope we’ll really find a compromise here in the long run,” he said.“While we don’t all agree on the policies and specific funding mechanisms right now, the negotiating is being done with a sense of mutual respect and understanding of each of our roles.”Seeking agreementShurtleff, on his way into the House voting session on Thursday, said he is “cautiously optimistic.”“We all want to get to ‘yes’ on a budget. I’m cautiously optimistic that we’ll reach some agreement soon,” he said. “The continuing resolution is necessary but it doesn’t fulfill the needs of Granite Staters, so the sooner we can find resolution the better. It just seems that business taxes are going to be the one hangup.”Democrats want to revoke rate cuts in the Business Profits Tax and Business Enterprise Tax that took effect on Jan. 1, something Sununu says would violate his campaign pledge against any new taxes.In their meeting on Wednesday, Shurtleff proposed a compromise that was not well-received by the governor, but was not rejected out of hand.“The Speaker brought forth a couple ideas in the meeting, but we couldn’t quite find the right middle ground,” said Sununu.“He brought forth the idea of temporarily doing the tax cuts and then moving them back up. That’s probably not going to work for the state in the long run. There’s just no need for the tax increases at any point. We have a lot of money.”Shurtleff declined to elaborate on his proposal. “I made a minor offer, as I want to let the governor know we want to talk and want to compromise,” he said. “As I’ve said before, we’ll always compromise our policy but not our principles.”Acrimonious debateThe cordial tone struck by Sununu and legislative leadership was in stark contrast to the acrimonious debate on the budget, particularly in the Senate.Senate Majority Leader Dan Feltes, D-Concord, suggested Democrats could revoke some of the compromises they’ve agreed to if Sununu follows through on the veto threat.“The entire budget gets reopened and everything is back on the table,” he said. “Is it reasonable to veto a budget that results in that kind of situation? I don’t think so. No one I talked to thinks so.”Republicans criticized Democrats for using a budget surplus from the current biennium, estimated at around $160 million, to help balance the budget over the next two fiscal years.Senate Republican Leader Chuck Morse, R-Salem, described the resulting $1.5 billion in additional spending over the current biennium as “totally unacceptable.”Sen. Tom Sherman, D-Rye, said the surplus demonstrates that the Legislature had the money to more aggressively respond to the challenges facing the state, but failed to do so.“We under-spent or we under-projected (revenue),” he said, “So we have a surplus of money, but we also have a surplus of crises in four areas — mental health, substance abuse, education and DCYF.”Sherman said the state can voluntarily address those issues through the budget, or be dragged into a resolution by the courts.“If anyone of those ends up in court, as they have in the past and as they are currently starting to do, you have not seen a structural deficit like the one we will have when we have to pay out on those,” he said.dsolomon@unionleader.com"

The kind of fair and equal process that is supposed to be the foundation of a democracy.Our state government is close to creating an independent redistricting commission that would eliminate the corrupt gerrymandering that has already led to some skewed and manipulated districts in New Hampshire.The current maps were drawn in a back-room process where our politicians picked their voters, not the other way around. But elected officials from both parties in New Hampshire are standing up and saying this is not fair, it’s not representative of the people, and it needs to be changed.These lawmakers — Republicans and Democrats — have passed a bill through the House and Senate that would put the redistricting process in the hands of an independent commission, rather than in the hands of one political party.If Gov. Chris Sununu takes their lead and signs the bill, the commission will be in place in time to draw new fair and equal maps after the 2020 census.This is something we should all agree on and be proud of.COTY DONOHUESomersworth"

Chris Sununu and other state and local officials joined school leaders to celebrate the opening of the school’s second location at 109 Towle Farm Road.The school, which first opened in Manchester in 2012, offers courses in a variety of trades, including oil and gas heating, air conditioning, plumbing and electrical work.Sununu said the trade school is something that is desperately needed in New Hampshire.“What we’re dealing with today is, we’ve set ourselves up to not be successful over the past 20 years when it comes to the trades. To be very blunt about it, we put a stigma on the trades. We didn’t highlight them. We didn’t talk about the opportunity they create for students, the opportunity they create for workers who want to get re-skilled in something else,” he said.John Duff, the school’s co-owner and vice president, said the school was founded after he, his partner and the school’s director Dean Millard, and Millard’s father Robert Millard saw the dire need for quality education in the trades industry.“We wanted to open a first of its kind educational facility dedicated solely to the trades right here in New Hampshire,” Duff said.They found property at 7 Perimeter Road in Manchester to open their first school, but on the day they signed the lease, Robert Millard died and was never able to see his dream realized.Duff said the loss was difficult, but it inspired him and Dean Millard to continue with plans for the school, which opened in September 2012.“I am sure that Robert would be absolutely proud of what we were able to accomplish here,” Duff said.

The Winnacunnet High School Marine Junior ROTC presented the colors at a flag raising ceremony in front of the school in Robert Millard’s memory.Duff said the courses are affordable, with most lasting 15 weeks and averaging $2,500. The school, which has hands-on classrooms, also offers apprenticeships.Hampton Selectman Jim Waddell said the town embraced the plan for a local trade school.“It’s tremendous for Hampton, and it’s tremendous for New Hampshire. It’s tremendous for everybody,” he said.Air Force veteran Charles Fedelski has already completed an oil heat technician program at the new school. The 53-year-old from North Hampton has a background in restaurant management, but was looking for a new career option as he’s getting older and finds it harder to keep up with the pace of the restaurant business.“As you get older it’s nice to have a technical skill to fall back on, and I’ve had a lot of friends ask me, ‘Do you know an oil heat guy?’” he said.State Sen. Tom Sherman, D-Rye, said he’s spoken about the importance of trade schools with the principals from the Seacoast School of Technology and Concord Regional Technical Center, which serve high school students.“Both of them said the No. 1 problem isn’t the kids wanting to go into the trades; it’s the parents. It’s the parental expectation. Everybody’s college bound,” he said, noting the college debt that is shouldered by many students.Sherman said legislators are working with the community college system to develop pathways that will allow students to obtain a trade certificate by the time they graduate from high school."

Chris Sununu will need the vote of at least one of those Democrats to confirm his nominee, who was widely praised by current and past state Supreme Court judges at a confirmation hearing on Wednesday.“An independent judiciary is an essential component of our system and it must be protected,” said MacDonald in his opening statement. “My pledge to you and the people of New Hampshire is that if confirmed I will faithfully uphold and apply the law and perform all of my duties fairly and impartially.”He was questioned for more than an hour by councilors, mostly the Democrats, before they turned the floor over to 32 others who’d signed up to testify, with 24 in favor and eight opposed to the nomination.MacDonald, who has served as attorney general since April of 2017, is widely respected in the legal profession for his work on behalf of the Bar Association, his pro bono work on behalf of domestic violence victims, and his expertise in civil litigation on business issues.He also is steeped in Republican politics, having started his career in the Washington, D.C., office of Republican U.S. Sen. Gordon Humphrey, a strong anti-abortion conservative.MacDonald has served as secretary of the right-leaning Josiah Bartlett Center, represented the Catholic Diocese of Manchester and was a voting delegate to the Republican National Convention in 2016, committed to Florida Sen. Marco Rubio.“I was active in partisan politics; there’s no question about that,” he said in response to a question from Democratic Councilor Debora Pignatelli.“But that was a different role. I was acting as a private citizen. A judge rules on the law. Personal beliefs are left at the door. That’s the essence of the judicial function, and that has been my role as Attorney General. I defend and enforce the laws of our state without respect to my personal beliefs.”Did not seek postIn questioning from Democratic Councilor Andru Volinsky, MacDonald acknowledged that he applied to be an associate justice of the Supreme Court, not chief justice, on April 15, was interviewed by the Judicial Selection Commission on April 18 and met with Sununu on May 10.The governor formally nominated MacDonald to the chief justice position on June 5.Democratic councilors expressed concern over the fact that MacDonald would ascend to senior position on the state’s highest court having never been a judge at any level, and having never tried a case in front of a jury.

Attorney General Gordon MacDonald answers a question about Roe v. Wade during Wednesday’s hearing before the Executive Council on his nomination as chief justice of the state Supreme Court.


Thomas Roy/Union Leader



Several jurists testified in support of MacDonald, including former state Supreme Court justices Carol Ann Conboy and John Broderick, and current Chief Justice Robert Lynn.Some of the most compelling testimony came from Brian Harlow, a survivor of sex abuse in the Catholic church and a board member for the Coalition Against Domestic and Sexual Violence, who found MacDonald to be sincere and sympathetic, even though he represented the Diocese of Manchester.“He treated my family and I with fairness and did everything he could to make sure I didn’t feel ashamed,” said Harlow. “The respect Attorney General MacDonald showed me throughout the civil process meant the world to me. His fairness and compassion were nothing short of amazing.”Abortion rightsTestimony against MacDonald’s nomination came from those concerned about his position on abortion, despite his statement that, “It is settled law. As a judge I would be bound by Roe V. Wade and it would be my duty to uphold it.”Ruth Larsen of Alton urged the councilors to “not entrust the reproductive rights of women in New Hampshire to Gordon MacDonald.”She also challenged the attorney general’s handling of charges against Republican Rep. Michael Sylvia of Belmont for making a false statement under oath about his residency status in the run-up to the 2016 election.The Belknap County sheriff referred the matter to the Attorney General’s office for prosecution on April 18, 2017, but the case was never brought forward.Larsen said it was an example of MacDonald’s partisan management of the DOJ. “If he (Sylvia) had been a Democrat, you can imagine the outcry, fury and force with which he would have been prosecuted,” said Larsen.Also testifying against MacDonald was Janet Delfuoco of Northwood, who was found not guilty of four felony criminal threatening charges by a Strafford County Superior Court in April.She was accused of using Facebook to threaten the lives of Manchester attorney Clifford Gallant, as well as judges David Anderson and Mark Weaver.“He spent more than $300,000 prosecuting my case for a Facebook post that I took down two hours later,” she said.The council is expected to vote on the nomination at its next regularly scheduled meeting on July 10.dsolomon@unionleader.com"
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,Educators call on Sununu to pass budget with more school aid,"Jun 26, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/education/educators-call-on-sununu-to-pass-budget-with-more-school/article_241a46bf-a96f-525b-b6d0-1828e033bff5.html,"SOMERSWORTH — Educators in Somersworth were fired up about the proposed state budget Wednesday.Republican Gov. Chris Sununu told a crowd at the State of the State address in Dover Wednesday morning that he would veto this budget.After Sununu’s address, educators and advocates held a press conference in front of Somersworth Middle School to speak out against the veto threat.The bipartisan budget bill comes before the Democratically controlled House and Senate for an up or down vote Thursday.Public school employees on the Seacoast are mad because they say the proposed budget provides the biggest state increase to educational funding in more than two decades, money they need for upgrades to buildings, better technology and more programs for students.At the crux of the problem is the fact that New Hampshire still relies almost exclusively on local property taxes to fund education, more than 20 years after state Supreme Court rulings in Claremont I and II found that method unconstitutional.“Cities and towns like Somersworth continue to struggle to find funding to offer an education which will enable our students to have the skills necessary to compete in a global marketplace. With each year, we sacrifice other needs of our cities and towns in this state to ensure that same promise and opportunity each one of here was afforded,” Mayor and Somersworth Middle School Principal Dana Hilliard said.Hilliard called on the governor to sign the budget bill, which he said would finally start the process of adequately funding public schools in the state.Megan Tuttle, NEA-NH president, represents 17,000 educators across the state.“Every parent and every educator knows the last thing the Legislature should be doing is decreasing school funding, but that is just what our governor is indicating that he is going to do,” Tuttle said.Tuttle said there is research which shows a link between per pupil spending and student outcomes.“New Hampshire has failed to provide full, equitable and truly adequate funding for our public schools for decades,” Tuttle said. “Our state’s funding philosophy and practices have hurt communities across the state, from Claremont to Berlin to even some of the towns represented here today.”Dover Mayor Karen Weston was one of the speakers at the gathering in Somersworth. Her city sued the state in 2015, claiming it has lost millions of dollars over the years under New Hampshire’s funding formula.Weston said she spoke to Sununu about his plans to veto the budget on Saturday as he was on his way to Randolph to address the tragic motorcycle crash that killed seven people on Friday evening.“I said, ‘Governor, if you do not sign this budget, do you realize what this is going to do to our school districts? Every single school district is going to have negative effects. Any funding that we had expected to come — and I can tell you that Dover did incorporate some of this money into their next year’s budget – we will not receive,’” Weston said.“Ultimately, who is going to suffer? It’s going to be our school programs, our kids, our teachers, our taxpayers,” Weston said."

He is a true American hero,"" Scott said.The Granite Status confirmed Bolduc's supporter was Scott Trendell, a former, financial adviser for Ameriprise Financial Services based in Keene.Two years ago, the NH Bureau of Securities Regulation fined Trendell $5,000 and ordered him to pay $5,000 to cover the cost of an investigation into allegations he failed to ensure equities he sold to an investor at his former firm were suitable to the investor's ""age, risk, tolerance, investment objective and financial situation.""Trendell did not admit any wrongdoing but entered into the settlement in August 2017 to dispense with the matter.Under the terms of the settlement, Trendell said he was not permitted to talk about it.Bolduc said Trendell was a longtime friend and said it's obvious the national Democratic Party machine will try to pull out all the stops to discredit him, but the voters will reject it.""This is the work of a negative political machine that knows it is not going to win. Mark my words, this act will lead more Republicans, Democrats, independents and veterans to take a hard look at this campaign because they are tired of the same old politics of personal destruction,"" Bolduc said during a telephone interview.""This is everything voters are sick and tired of. They want effective leadership and this is the opposite of that. What you see is the latest act of a desperate political machine that will stop at nothing to attack me and friends of mine.""On Bolduc's own Twitter feed in June, he's pictured with Trendell and his high school football coach.

Maggie Hassan, D-NH, has been waging for months.The Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee endorsed a health care costs bill that included provisions Hassan championed to end surprise medical bills.She's been working with Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-LA, and members of both parties to prevent consumers from being stuck with high medical charges because they were unaware that they had gotten services from a provider, not in an insurance network.President Trump has endorsed this cause and earlier this week he signed an executive order aimed at giving consumers more transparency about the costs that health care providers are charging for medical procedures.""My top priority throughout this is to get the patients out of the middle of these billing disputes,"" Hassan said during a telephone interview.""There are still going to have to be a few adjustments we need to make before this leaves the Senate but we are hoping very much that it will reach the full Senate by the end of July.""The bill states in the case of a surprise medical bill, providers would be paid a standard benchmark rate based on the median contracted cost for the service in that geographic area.The nation's hospital lobby and some providers said without further change, the bill is unfair to them.They have been seeking a provision that would allow providers to get an independent arbitration to explore whether the insurer should have to reimburse the provider for the higher cost.Hassan said her original bill permitted such a process and she was hopeful arbitration in some form could emerge in the final package.""I continue to think that is an important mechanism. What we have from the chair and the ranking member of the committee is a commitment to make sure to level the playing field between the providers and insurance companies,"" Hassan said.Hassan has spoken to many residents with these issues, most recently Sarah Stewart of Dover, who had a surgery in network but got a $700 bill because the anesthesiologist was not in network.The insurer forgave Stewart having to pay the bill after media coverage.While Trump is going into federal court to try to strike down the essential features of Obamacare, Hassan was pleased Trump was on board with this change.""There is bipartisan interest in lowering the cost of health care. We continue to disagree with our insistence that all Americans should have access to affordable quality health care,"" Hassan said.According to Kaiser Health, 16% of inpatient stays and 18% of emergency visits left a patient with at least one out-of-network charge.The research also found that when a patient is admitted to the hospital from the emergency room, there's a higher likelihood of an out-of-network charge.Sen. Shaheen noted the same bill included a five-year authorization of a federal diabetes program she's worked on.""Improving our health care system requires good-faith, bipartisan negotiations,"" Shaheen said.Sununu's vetoes preview coming attractionsThe two-term Gov. Chris Sununu is expected to veto some very high-profile bills, including a two-year state budget that the Democratically-controlled House of Representatives and State Senate are expected to pass Thursday.Earlier this week, he had rejected another eight measures that had gotten much less attention during the 2019 session.The measures dealt with energy efficiency and climate change, ending a waiting period for the unemployed to get benefits and putting a cap on the number of hours youth workers can be made to work each week.Two of the bills were sponsored by Senate Majority Leader Dan Feltes, D-Concord, who is considering a 2020 primary run for governor.He authored the unemployment benefits reform and another making it easier for the state to crack down on companies that fail to have worker's compensation coverage for their workers.""With this veto of SB 146, Governor Sununu confirms he doesn't believe in unemployment insurance. He previously made that clear when he vetoed paid family and medical leave insurance, which operates like unemployment insurance,"" Feltes said. ""Because of Governor Sununu, workers who are crushed by job loss will have to wait a week for unemployment insurance. Family bills for medications, for rent, for food, for diapers -- those bills don't wait. Those bills are often picked up by municipalities through general assistance and local property tax payers. Governor Sununu's tone-deaf veto shows that he has never had to deal with unemployment insurance, nor does he care about those who lose their jobs.""Sununu said in his veto message that more than 80 percent of states have a waiting period before the jobless can get benefits. Doing away with a waiting period would lower the surplus in the unemployment insurance fund and over time lead to a tax increase for all employers, he warned.NH campaign vet returns to become Pappas spokesmanA familiar Democratic Party activist is returning to New Hampshire to serve as communications director for U.S. Rep.

Cory Booker, D-N.J., was weighing in on the day that Attorney General Gordon MacDonald faced his confirmation hearing over his nomination as chief justice of the New Hampshire Supreme Court. ""This is troubling. New Hampshire deserves a chief justice who will recognize reproductive freedom as health care.

Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,"U.S. Senate candidate Bolduc defends friend, attacks opposition research","Jun 26, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/politics/granite_status/u-s-senate-candidate-bolduc-defends-friend-attacks-opposition-research/article_67686e25-5ddf-5287-ac5b-5408bd8b8287.html,"By all accounts, Republican U.S. Senate candidate Don Bolduc had a pretty good announcement event last Monday.The retired brigadier general and genuine American war hero stuck with an optimistic, upbeat view while kicking off the campaign at the Concord VFW Hall.The ending of a campaign-sponsored YouTube video concluded with a single testimonial from someone only identified as “Scott” and “Friend.”“If Don Bolduc takes on a task, he’s never, ever gonna quit. He is a true American hero,” Scott said.The Granite Status confirmed Bolduc’s supporter was Scott Trendell, a former, financial adviser for Ameriprise Financial Services based in Keene.Two years ago, the NH Bureau of Securities Regulation fined Trendell $5,000 and ordered him to pay $5,000 to cover the cost of an investigation into allegations he failed to ensure equities he sold to an investor at his former firm were suitable to the investor’s “age, risk, tolerance, investment objective and financial situation.”Trendell did not admit any wrongdoing but entered into the settlement in August 2017 to dispense with the matter.Under the terms of the settlement, Trendell said he was not permitted to talk about it.Bolduc said Trendell was a longtime friend and said it’s obvious the national Democratic Party machine will try to pull out all the stops to discredit him, but the voters will reject it.“This is the work of a negative political machine that knows it is not going to win. Mark my words, this act will lead more Republicans, Democrats, independents and veterans to take a hard look at this campaign because they are tired of the same old politics of personal destruction,” Bolduc said during a telephone interview.“This is everything voters are sick and tired of. They want effective leadership and this is the opposite of that. What you see is the latest act of a desperate political machine that will stop at nothing to attack me and friends of mine.”On Bolduc’s own Twitter feed in June, he’s pictured with Trendell and his high school football coach. Trendell was quarterback while Bolduc played running back at Laconia High.Messner hires successful Mass. operativeThe third likely Republican for the U.S. Senate hasn’t taken the plunge yet, but he sure is staffing up.Bryant “Corky” Messner of Wolfeboro has had little to say publicly but continues to identify the core members of a campaign team if he goes ahead as expected and launches a U.S. Senate challenge of Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-NH, in 2020.He’s identified as his general campaign consultant Jim Conroy, who managed the successful campaigns of Charlie Baker for governor of Massachusetts.Last month Messner had brought on to advise him Todd Cheewing, the former executive director of the Republican State Committee.Hassan’s surprise medical bills reform moving aheadA U.S. Senate committee Wednesday gave the first legislative victory to a policy campaign Sen. Maggie Hassan, D-NH, has been waging for months.The Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee endorsed a health care costs bill that included provisions Hassan championed to end surprise medical bills.She’s been working with Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., and members of both parties to prevent consumers from being stuck with high medical charges because they were unaware that they had gotten services from a provider, not in an insurance network.President Trump has endorsed this cause and earlier this week he signed an executive order aimed at giving consumers more transparency about the costs that health care providers are charging for medical procedures.“My top priority throughout this is to get the patients out of the middle of these billing disputes,” Hassan said during a telephone interview.“There are still going to have to be a few adjustments we need to make before this leaves the Senate but we are hoping very much that it will reach the full Senate by the end of July.”The bill states in the case of a surprise medical bill, providers would be paid a standard benchmark rate based on the median contracted cost for the service in that geographic area.The nation’s hospital lobby and some providers said without further change, the bill is unfair to them.They have been seeking a provision that would allow providers to get an independent arbitration to explore whether the insurer should have to reimburse the provider for the higher cost.Hassan said her original bill permitted such a process and she was hopeful arbitration in some form could emerge in the final package.“I continue to think that is an important mechanism. What we have from the chair and the ranking member of the committee is a commitment to make sure to level the playing field between the providers and insurance companies,” Hassan said.Hassan has spoken to many residents with these issues, most recently Sarah Stewart of Dover, who had a surgery in network but got a $700 bill because the anesthesiologist was not in network.The insurer forgave Stewart having to pay the bill after media coverage.While Trump is going into federal court to try to strike down the essential features of Obamacare, Hassan was pleased Trump was on board with this change.“There is bipartisan interest in lowering the cost of health care. We continue to disagree with our insistence that all Americans should have access to affordable quality health care,” Hassan said.According to Kaiser Health, 16% of inpatient stays and 18% of emergency visits left a patient with at least one out-of-network charge.The research also found that when a patient is admitted to the hospital from the emergency room, there’s a higher likelihood of an out-of-network charge.Sen. Shaheen noted the same bill included a five-year authorization of a federal diabetes program she’s worked on.“Improving our health care system requires good-faith, bipartisan negotiations,” Shaheen said.(For more Granite Status, go to www.unionleader.com.)klandrigan@unionleader.comSununu’s vetoes preview coming attractionsThe two-term Gov.Chris Sununuis expected to veto some very high-profile bills, including a two-year state budget that the Democratically-controlled House of Representatives and State Senate are expected to pass Thursday.Earlier this week, he had rejected another eight measures that had gotten much less attention during the 2019 session.The measures dealt with energy efficiency and climate change, ending a waiting period for the unemployed to get benefits and putting a cap on the number of hours youth workers can be made to work each week.Two of the bills were sponsored by Senate Majority Leader Dan Feltes, D-Concord, who is considering a 2020 primary run for governor.He authored the unemployment benefits reform and another making it easier for the state to crack down on companies that fail to have worker’s compensation coverage for their workers.”With this veto of SB 146, Governor Sununu confirms he doesn’t believe in unemployment insurance. He previously made that clear when he vetoed paid family and medical leave insurance, which operates like unemployment insurance,” Feltes said. “Because of Governor Sununu, workers who are crushed by job loss will have to wait a week for unemployment insurance. Family bills for medications, for rent, for food, for diapers — those bills don’t wait. Those bills are often picked up by municipalities through general assistance and local property tax payers. Governor Sununu’s tone-deaf veto shows that he has never had to deal with unemployment insurance, nor does he care about those who lose their jobs.”Sununu said in his veto message that more than 80 percent of states have a waiting period before the jobless can get benefits. Doing away with a waiting period would lower the surplus in the unemployment insurance fund and over time lead to a tax increase for all employers, he warned.NH Dems issue debate bingo cardsThe New Hampshire Democratic Party released bingo cards for the two nights of televised debates to highlight issues officials said are important to working families, from affordable health care and equal pay for equal work to support for veterans and reproductive rights.”Every Democratic candidate in the first-in-the-nation primary has been talking about rebuilding the middle class, protecting reproductive rights, making sure all Americans have access to affordable quality health care, and much more,” saidRay Buckley, party chairman.”No matter which Democrat becomes the nominee, Granite Staters will be yelling ‘Bingo!’ — because on issue after issue, Democrats are fighting for the middle class.”2020 candidates talking NH issuesEven while they aren’t visiting New Hampshire, the presidential hopefuls are looking to weigh in on issues of the day important to state Democrats.That’s why Sen.Cory Booker,D-N.J., was weighing in on the day that Attorney GeneralGordon MacDonaldfaced his confirmation hearing over his nomination as chief justice of the New Hampshire Supreme Court.”This is troubling. New Hampshire deserves a chief justice who will recognize reproductive freedom as health care.

Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,Jennifer Horn: MacDonald the right choice for NH chief justice,"Jun 26, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/opinion/columnists/jennifer-horn-macdonald-the-right-choice-for-nh-chief-justice/article_8ee44b86-f198-599f-97fd-e75ad7450f9d.html,"IN THE anything-goes environment of contemporary politics, there are few rules and even fewer consequences for bad behavior. If there is one cardinal sin in politics today, however, it is acknowledging that your opponent has achieved anything good or done anything right, no matter how indisputable the accomplishment.We are seeing this strategy of “deny the obvious” play out here in New Hampshire, in the nomination by Gov. Chris Sununu of Gordon MacDonald to become the next chief justice of the New Hampshire Supreme Court, as led by Democratic Executive Councilor Andru Volinsky, he of “Let’s pretend to be secret agents investigating liquor stores” fame.Volinsky has questioned the nomination process, calling it “wired,” and attacked MacDonald on political issues.Currently New Hampshire attorney general, MacDonald is one of the most accomplished and widely respected people in state government. He also is possibly the most humble person in government. While Gordon would never bend your ear with tales about all of his professional accomplishments, there are hundreds of other Granite Staters who know well his qualifications for this role and would gladly tell you why MacDonald is the best man for the job.In fact, a bipartisan group of over 115 New Hampshire attorneys put their names on a letter supporting his nomination. Three former Supreme Court chief justices have endorsed him. Dozens of others from both sides of the political aisle have publicly supported this nomination (including myself).As attorney general, MacDonald is credited with bringing the AG’s Office into the 21st century. He created the first Civil Rights Unit, Election Law Unit, and a solicitor general position. An attorney friend of mine — a dedicated Democrat — credits MacDonald with “writing the book” on New Hampshire civil legal practice. (Apparently, he actually wrote a 3-volume book on this.)He was appointed by the state Supreme Court to be chair of the New Hampshire Board of Bar Examiners and as chair of the New Hampshire Supreme Court’s Commission on the New Hampshire Bar in the 21st Century. He has volunteered as an attorney for the New Hampshire Bar Association’s Domestic Violence Emergency Program and as chair of the Campaign for Legal Services Leadership Council, which raises funds for civil legal assistance in the Granite State.Equally impressive, when MacDonald was nominated to become our state’s attorney general, he received the unanimous, bipartisan approval of the Executive Council, including affirmative votes from now-Congressman Chris Pappas and Volinsky.Which makes Volinsky’s current position all the more confusing, or, perhaps, transparent.Volinsky has made no secret of the fact that he is considering a run for governor in 2020, a race that would pit him against Sununu. As the cardinal rule of politics goes, Volinsky refuses to acknowledge that Sununu has done something right, no matter how obvious, like nominate the most qualified person in the state to become the next Supreme Court chief justice.This is not the first time Volinsky has tried to use his position on the council to attack legitimate nominees on political grounds. His attacks on the religious beliefs of Department of Education Commissioner Frank Edelblut come to mind.The role of chief justice is often described as being largely administrative. It is not a political position and the nominating process should not be politicized in order to advance the gubernatorial ambitions of one man.I personally know Gordon MacDonald to be a man of extraordinary character and integrity. His dedication has always been to law, equality and principle above politics. He is the right person to become the next chief justice."
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,MacDonald describes cases he will avoid if confirmed as chief justice,"Jun 25, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/politics/state/macdonald-describes-cases-he-will-avoid-if-confirmed-as-chief/article_2f25f693-4db4-5701-858a-db63726cdcef.html,"CONCORD — Attorney General Gordon MacDonald, in a letter to Gov. Chris Sununu and members of the Executive Council, has outlined the circumstances under which he will disqualify or “recuse” himself from certain cases if confirmed to be the next Chief Justice of the New Hampshire Supreme Court.The letter, dated Monday, was sent just 48 hours ahead of MacDonald’s confirmation hearing of June 26 in council chambers.MacDonald said that if confirmed he would recuse himself from any cases that come before the Supreme Court involving civil matters “pending in the Attorney General’s office at the time that I leave that is either on appeal or results in an appeal.” (Related opinion piece, Page A6.)Regarding criminal cases, MacDonald said he would recuse himself from any criminal appeal pending in the Attorney General’s office, any criminal matter involving charges brought by the Attorney General during his service that results in an appeal, and any matter arising from an investigation undertaken during his tenure that results in an appeal.MacDonald said he reviewed the Supreme Court’s Judicial Code of Conduct and consulted with UNH law professor Mitchell Simon, an expert in the field of professional responsibility for attorneys, in a process that is ongoing.“I will continue to review my obligations under the applicable authorities,” his letter states. “If I determine that additional steps are required, I will take them.”MacDonald also noted that there are procedural safeguards in place to ensure impartiality, citing a Supreme Court rule that allows for one of the parties in a case to move for recusal if a judge does not disqualify himself, subject to review by the entire court.


            Dave Solomon's State House Dome: Interim chief named at DOJCouncilor Andru Volinsky, D-Concord, said most of the issues that will require recusal will involve MacDonald’s experience as Attorney General, not his years in private practice.“I think his private practice cases have largely worked through the system,” said Volinsky.But there are plenty of high-profile cases that could come before the court that would meet MacDonald’s criteria for recusal.The American Civil Liberties Union of New Hampshire (ACLU-NH) on June 15 published a list of questions it would like to see MacDonald answer. Question 3, right after racial bias and reproductive rights, alludes to recusal.It asks: “As a Supreme Court Justice, would you agree to recuse yourself in all civil and criminal cases in which, while you were Attorney General, your office was a party or counsel?”According to the ACLU, those cases could include the Contoocook Valley School District lawsuit over school funding; the right-to-know lawsuit over the list of law enforcement officers with credibility problems in court (the so-called Laurie List); and the lawsuits filed by the League of Women Voters and New Hampshire Democratic Party over Republican-passed election law.The ACLU predicts that MacDonald would also have to recuse himself from lesser known cases like Jones v. State, a search and seizure case addressing race; and John Doe v. State, which challenges emergency room involuntary boarding without due process.Also at issue are recent cases filed by the Department of Justice against the chemical companies that manufacture PFAS chemicals.Councilors say they have received a large volume of constituent input on the nomination, pro and con, and are anticipating a good turnout on Wednesday with many hoping to testify.North Country Councilor Michael Cryans, a Democrat, says he plans to raise the question of judicial experience (MacDonald has none), election law, abortion and the Northern Pass. Eversource is appealing the permit denial by the Public Utilities Commission for the Northern Pass hydroelectric project to the state Supreme Court.“Those are the things I have probably heard the most on in my district, and I’m getting a lot of calls and a lot of emails, more against than for,” Cryans said of the nomination.Republican Councilor Ted Gatsas of Manchester declined to comment on what questions he will ask, but said his constituent input has been mostly positive.“I know that Gordon MacDonald makes decisions not based on what his own personal beliefs are but what the law says,” said Gatsas.Councilors Russell Prescott, R-Kingston, and Debora Pignatelli, D-Nashua, declined to comment. The New Hampshire Democratic Party meanwhile launched a new digital ad against the MacDonald nomination, accusing Sununu, who has supported abortion rights in the past, of choosing an “anti-choice” candidate.“With the whole country one court decision away from an extreme abortion ban, Sununu’s anti-choice pick for New Hampshire’s highest court is dangerous for women and raises serious questions about Sununu’s own position on abortion,” according to the ad posted on Facebook and Twitter.dsolomon@unionleader.com"
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,"With budget veto looming, both sides play the blame game","Jun 25, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/politics/state/with-budget-veto-looming-both-sides-play-the-blame-game/article_a8801b83-df7a-515e-8a29-c084f91730e6.html,"CONCORD — Republican Gov. Chris Sununu has all but guaranteed a veto of the state budget that will come before the Democratically controlled House and Senate for an up or down vote on Thursday.“There are a few lines I will not cross, and the Legislature is knowingly sending a budget to my desk that I cannot support,” he said on Tuesday, as the two sides exchanged barbs over who has been more willing to compromise in the budget battle.“We’ve crafted a balanced budget that addresses most of Gov. Sununu’s concerns and represents true legislative compromise,” said Senate President Donna Soucy, D-Manchester, surrounded by Democratic representatives and senators at a press briefing in the Legislative Office Building on Tuesday.The Democrats mimicked the posters that surrounded Sununu when he unveiled his “Roadmap to Common Ground” on June 12 with visuals of their own, listing how they concurred with Sununu in virtually every area except one — business taxes.Democrats want to revoke business tax cuts that took effect on Jan. 1 and another round scheduled for 2021. While Sununu says he is willing to bargain on 2021, he sees any revocation of a tax cut already promised for 2019 as a tax increase he is pledged to oppose.On Jan. 1 the Business Profits Tax rate (BPT) was lowered to 7.7%. Under the Legislative budget, the BPT will increase back up to 7.9%. The business enterprise tax (BET) is currently at 0.6%, and will go back up to 0.675% under the budget.“This is a tax increase. It is not a tax ‘freeze,’” said Sununu.Surplus carryoverThe governor also takes issue with the fact that Democrats have rolled a good portion of the budget surplus from 2019 into operating expenses for 2020-21.Democrats say their revenue projections are solid, and keeping business taxes at 2018 rates will help the state to keep up with higher expenses in the future.“The people of New Hampshire elected divided government, but they do expect us to work together for the common good,” said Democratic House Speaker Steve Shurtleff of Concord.“We have done many things that the governor mentioned in his roadmap, meeting him more than halfway and then some. He says he wants a compromise, but now with a promise of a veto he has indicated his position is all or nothing.”Shurtleff accused Sununu of having “tunnel vision” with his focus on the business taxes, arguing that businesses prefer the tax reform in the legislative budget over a fractional reduction in the rate.Senate President Donna Soucy outlined all the areas in which the Legislature compromised on its priorities, citing the posters to her left and right.“Two weeks ago, Gov. Sununu laid out his road map to common ground,” she said. “As you can see from this visual, legislators listened, we found agreement on the majority of budgetary issues the governor raises, and we continue to listen.”Centerpiece policySoucy cited the Democrats’ willingness to abandon their paid family leave plan, a centerpiece of the party’s policy agenda for the legislative session embodied in Senate Bill 1.The House surrendered its capital gains tax, and Sununu got much of what he wanted in other areas of the budget.The governor said he has compromised with the Legislature by accepting its plans for education funding, targeted Medicaid provider rates, $40 million in unrestricted state aid to cities and towns, and increases in funding for child protection beyond what he proposed.“I have worked with Legislative leaders and found common ground on many issues and have met them more than halfway on many of their spending requests while also proposing a path forward that does not raise taxes,” he said.Senate Finance Committee Chair Lou D’Allesandro said maintaining business taxes at 2018 levels is key to the solvency of the Legislative budget, and would be difficult if not impossible to negotiate away without sacrificing a key component of the plan — more money for public education.“With the increases in education, we need that money,” he said. “It’s the last anchor in the chain that holds this budget together. You don’t want to trade away a good anchor.”House leadership from both parties has already met to discuss a continuing resolution. It would authorize the ongoing operation of state agencies and government offices under current spending levels should the budget be vetoed, allowing for negotiations to continue over the summer.“Our plan is to bring it to the floor as a joint motion by the majority and minority leader as the first order of business when we meet on Thursday,” said Shurtleff.dsolomon@unionleader.com"

“Furthermore, the team has put together a detailed plan for Phase 1 with redevelopment strategies, cost breakdowns and renderings, making the renovation virtually ‘shovel-ready,’” the CBRE ad says.Phase I, however, will require about $175 million in capital to make it happen. Otten and company explored several funding avenues, including a $28 million loan guarantee from the Business Finance Authority, but all failed to materialize.The Balsams and its many supporters were able to convince the New Hampshire Legislature to adopt and Gov. Chris Sununu to sign House Bill 540, which allows counties, in this case Coos County, to issue bonds for Redevelopment Districts in unincorporated places like Dixville.The Coos County Commission is presently working to finalize details of how it could “float” a bond for Dixville that would be purchased by an outside party and repaid at no risk to county taxpayers.To facilitate the Balsams project, Sununu also designated Dixville as a federal “Opportunity Zone,” which is another potential source of money for redevelopment.Asked about The Balsams being “for sale,” Scott Tranchemontagne, who is a spokesman for Otten, said Otten and company’s engagement with CBRE “has been long-planned, based on the multi-year relationship around our redevelopment efforts, and was a natural next step in our financing efforts. We have said from the very beginning that we would be seeking equity investors. This is part of that process.”In e-mails, Tranchemontagne said that taking on equity investors “might result in direct investment or sale of parts of the project’s assets.”He added that “Seeking additional investors, or owners, has always been an integral part of our financing plan,” and now that the Opportunity Zone investment is available, “this is the best way to reach the widest possible pool of investors.”The CBRE ad notes that “upon acquiring The Balsams, the new investor will have complete access to the in-place development team,” led by Otten, “and the multi-phased plan to position The Balsams as one of the largest and most renowned resorts in the Northeast.”Otten and his team, the ad continues, are “prepared to work hand-in-hand with new investors, whether that be moving forward with their approved plans or shifting gears to a new vision.”John Scarinza, chairman of the Coos County Planning Board, did not immediately reply to an inquiry asking whether a significant change in the vision from what the board has already approved for The Balsams would require new application and approvals.Closed since 2011, The Balsams has been before the Coos County Planning Board since 2014 in one form or another. In 2015, the planning board approved the Planned Unit Development for the project.Despite looking for new investors, Tranchemontagne said Otten and his team “have every intention of renovating and expanding the Balsams Resort as has been contemplated for the past several years.”He said CBRE will identify potential investors, noting that “CBRE is extraordinarily familiar with the Balsams, having completed the market feasibility study on the project in 2018, and based on CBRE’s hotel and resort experience and relationships, they have access to a broader investor pool to advance the Balsams efforts.”Tranchemontagne said that regardless of who gets credit for making it come to fruition, “our highest priority is making sure the Balsams project moves forward and succeeds, thereby creating several hundred new jobs and attracting hundreds of millions of dollars in investment in the North Country,” he said."

The answer is nothing, except that Senate Democrats for reasons they have yet to explain decided to attach the “non-germane” amendment about judges to the marriage officiant bill.The last-minute maneuver on HB 295 confused stakeholders who’d followed the legislation closely. One of those stakeholders, the N.H. Coalition Against Domestic and Sexual Violence (NHCADSV), was counting on more than $51,000 in license fees from the special officiant program.Jessica Eskeland, public policy specialist for the NHCADSV, testified in support of the bill during its Senate hearing, pointing out that the bulk of the funds from the new licenses would go to help support the organization’s 13 domestic crisis centers around the state.The coalition had to turn away 1,854 adults and 1,310 children over the past two years due to a lack of space at the centers, which desperately need a more stable funding source, she said.“I’m trying to find out what happened,” she said. “The underlying bill had broad bipartisan support, but the Senate walked away from it after the judicial amendment went down.”Surprise amendmentThe legislation passed the House on April 4 in a 214-155 vote, authorizing the Secretary of State to issue the one-time marriage officiant license to anyone who completes a registration form and pays a $30 fee.The Senate Judiciary Committee held a public hearing on the bill in April, with no indication that any amendments were coming. Then at the committee voting session on May 14, Democrats introduced the amendment regarding temporary appointment of retired Supreme Court justices during vacancies on the court.Republican Sen. Sharon Carson of Londonderry, a committee member and co-sponsor of the underlying bill, said at the time that she was blindsided by the move.“It is shocking that Senate Democrats would use a bill related to temporary marriage officiant licenses to attach a non-germane amendment with such far-reaching consequences,” she said.“This amendment should have had a public hearing, so the committee could learn what it does and uncover any unintended consequences. Instead the people have been cut out of the process; half the committee members were left in the dark; and the state Supreme Court itself was completely unaware of the proposed change. This complete abandonment of the process is unacceptable and should never have been allowed to happen.”Party-line votesDespite those protests, the bill as amended was voted out of committee along party lines, and passed the Senate on May 30 in a 14-10 party-line vote.When the conference committee of House and Senate negotiators met to hash out their differences on June 17, Eileen Fox, clerk of the Supreme Court, was asked to testify, which is unusual at such a late stage in the legislative process.She confirmed upon questioning by Republican Sen. Harold French of Franklin that the court system did not ask for the amendment. “We didn’t ask for it, but when we learned of it we thought it would be helpful,” she said.House members on the conference committee, however, would not budge, citing a lack of proper procedures in adopting the amendment and concerns about its constitutionality.“These issues were raised during the committee of conference and the Senate conferees agreed to withdraw their amendment and pass the bill as it left the House,” according to Democratic Rep. David Woodbury of New Boston. “Subsequent to the meeting, the Senate conferees did not sign off.”Senate President Donna Soucy on Monday declined to comment on why Senate members of the conference committee led their House counterparts to believe they had a deal on the underlying bill only to let it die on the vine without explanation.She provided a written statement: “Throughout the session we received push back about some complications with the bill and there were differences between the House and Senate versions of the bill which ultimately couldn’t be reconciled at this time. However, I look forward to revisiting the issue soon.”Questions remainThe question of finding fill-ins for Supreme Court judges isn’t entirely academic, as Gov. Chris Sununu has nominated Attorney General Gordon MacDonald to serve as chief justice. If confirmed, MacDonald would have to recuse himself from several cases coming to the court that he was involved with as head of the Department of Justice.There have been recent unsuccessful attempts to amend the constitution so that judges would not face mandatory retirement at 70, and several retired justices like John Broderick and Carol Ann Conboy still have an active public profile.But how those dynamics converged on a bill designed to make New Hampshire a friendlier wedding venue remains a mystery. The Senate office would not identify the author of the amendment on fill-in judges, describing it as a “committee amendment.”Soucy had to replace two Democratic Senators on the Senate-House conference committee, which usually happens when lawmakers decline to vote as instructed. She first replaced Sen. Shannon Chandley of Amherst with Sen. Melanie Levesque of Nashua on June 14, and then put herself in Levesque’s place on June 20, the day the bill died for lack of sign-off by the Senate.“We find the whole thing curious, and I know my folks are asking questions,” said Eskeland.“I have a sense that there’s something larger going on behind the scenes that we are not aware of. We look forward to working with the legislature to revive the bill.”dsolomon@unionleader.com"
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,Six law firms to represent state in lawsuit over PFAS,"Jun 23, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/courts/six-law-firms-to-represent-state-in-lawsuit-over-pfas/article_e6f2e6d9-c46d-5c0b-8cbd-c509e0d51b3d.html,"CONCORD — The state Department of Justice has lined up six nationally known law firms to represent New Hampshire in its landmark lawsuit against major chemical companies over contamination from chemicals used in products with trade names like Teflon and Scotchgard.The Executive Council and Legislative Fiscal Committee have both approved a June 11 agreement that guarantees the law firms 20 percent of any settlement, after expenses.Gov. Chris Sununu and Attorney General Gordon MacDonald in May announced the lawsuit was filed in Hillsborough County Superior Court against 3M, DuPont and the Chemours Company, all of which manufacture and distribute chemicals known as PFAS (polyfluroalkyl substances).A separate lawsuit was filed against the companies responsible for firefighting foam containing some of the same chemicals, including Chemguard, Tyco Fire Products, Buckeye Fire Equipment, Kidde-Fenwal and National Foam.DuPont, 3M and Chemours, a spin-off from DuPont, are named in both suits. The suits allege that despite their unique knowledge of the dangers of these chemicals, the companies continued to make and sell them without warning the public of their health risks.The lawsuits seek damages for contamination of the state’s natural resources and will seek to recover costs related to the investigation, cleanup and other forms of response to contamination.One of the six law firms retained by the state is SL Environmental Law Group of San Francisco, which specializes exclusively in environmental litigation.That firm represented New Hampshire in 2013, when a Superior Court jury awarded the state $236 million in a lawsuit against ExxonMobil for groundwater contamination caused by the gasoline additive MTBE.By the time appeals were exhausted, the principal and interest owed the state had grown to $300 million.MacDonald said the award in the PFAS case could match or exceed the ExxonMobil verdict if the state prevails in court or reaches pre-trial settlements.The other law firms retained are:• Kelley Drye & Warren, a New York firm with more than 40 areas of specialization identified on its website, including environmental litigation;• Taft Stettinius & Hollister, with offices in Chicago and eight other cities, also has multiple areas of expertise, including environmental litigation;• Douglas & London, a New York law firm specializing in personal injury and class action lawsuits;• Levin Papantonio, of Pensacola, Fla., which also has multiple lines of practice, including personal injury, class action and environmental; and,• Kennedy & Madonna, a New York law firm co-founded by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., that specializes in representing individuals, municipalities and states that have been impacted by pollution.The six firms have formed a consortium to represent plaintiffs in PFAS or similar lawsuits. Officials from the Department of Justice interviewed lawyers representing two such groups before settling on one, according to Chris Aslin, senior assistant attorney general.“We typically do not issue requests for proposals for legal counsel contracts,” he said.In this case, Attorney General Gordon MacDonald consulted with Senior Assistant AG Alan Brooks, chief of the Environmental Bureau at the DOJ, as to which groups of lawyers should be considered.“He identified those firms or groups of firms that have had experience with this issue, and we reached out to them,” said Aslin. “We had two of them in for interviews and presentations. We reviewed those presentations and their credentials and made a decision about what group of firms to hire.”Brooks will serve as the main contact with the attorneys, with Aslin as his backup. The agreement with the attorneys was posted prior to consideration by both the Executive Council and Fiscal Committee.“The process we followed after selection was very transparent, very public and very consistent with all of the laws,” said Associate Attorney General Dianne Martin.dsolomon@unionleader.com"
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,Derry councilors say Sununu's veto keeps the town from becoming net zero community,"Jun 23, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/business/energy/derry-councilors-say-sununu-s-veto-keeps-the-town-from/article_aed47add-0f4c-5208-811d-7b784ef1a5b6.html,"DERRY — Town officials are saying Gov. Chris Sununu’s veto earlier this month of a bill that would have expanded electric net metering has cost the town nearly $1 million in potential electricity savings for taxpayers.Town Council Chairman Neil Wetherbee and Town Councilor Joshua Bourdon, who represents the town on the Net Zero Task Force, say the bill would enable the construction of a 5-megawatt solar array that would supply enough energy to cover the town’s municipal and school district energy needs.“We would have been the first town in the state of New Hampshire that would be net zero, from a school and town perspective,” Bourdon said.Net Zero Task Force Chairman Jeff Moulton agreed with that assessment and said he’s disappointed by the veto.He said a 5-megawatt buildout over 10 to 15 acres of town-owned land would ultimately save taxpayers approximately $1.2 million.If lawmakers don’t override the governor’s veto this fall, the town will be limited to building a 1-megawatt solar field on 4 acres, which Moulton said would save the town about $240,000 in taxes annually, by covering about 45% of the town’s electricity needs. Moulton said the 1-megawatt array would still result in a discounted electricity rate of $60,000 annually while it’s still owned by the developers.Whether the solar array is 1 or 5 megawatts, the savings would materialize in about five years after the construction of the array is paid off.It’s estimated to cost about $3 million to build the smaller array, and between $12 and $15 million for the full buildout.The 1-megawatt project already went out to bid, and the task force is entering negotiations with a contractor.“We prefer not to name them right now because if contract negotiations don’t go well, then we will go to the next vendor,” Moulton said.The 1-megawatt solar array was proposed to the Town Council in January, and the council granted initial approval, scheduling a vote for final approval in August. Bourdon said he is confident the town council will approve it then. Wetherbee and Councilor Jim Morgan said there is strong support for the project, but stopped short of predicting the outcome of the vote.“It looks very favorable, but I don’t speculate on votes in the middle of a process,” Morgan said.Wetherbee said he hopes Derry’s representatives in the House and Senate will vote to override the veto, if such a vote takes place.“There’s nothing wrong with being a supporter of the governor but acknowledging he’s just wrong on this issue,” Wetherbee said.Morgan, a Republican, said he wanted to see more data before backing the claims that the bill would enable the town to become fully net zero, but agreed the bill would be good for the town.“The governor is faced with many tough decisions in the climate that exists,” Morgan said. “His veto does not allow us to move forward with anything bigger than what was proposed today. That is unfortunate for what perhaps could have been a tax-reduced help to Derry.”In his veto message, Sununu called the bill a “regressive cost burden on citizens that benefits large-scale solar developers while hurting all ratepayers, including the elderly and those on fixed incomes.”He said the bill was a subsidy that would cost ratepayers hundreds of millions of dollars in electric bills over the life of the program. He said he was committed to advancing renewable energy in the state, but that we “should not allow our good intentions to mask a bad policy.”Bourdon said he’s “devastated” by the veto, saying it makes it harder to cut taxes and maintain services.“I’m trying to come up with clever ways to bail out a property-poor community,” Bourdon said.In the meantime, he said he plans to go to other communities and offer assistance in how to create a net zero task force of their own and create similar renewable energy initiatives.ldnews@unionleader.com"

Oakes and Jo-ann Corr were “supporters” of the club, Young said.According to Young, Jo-ann Corr was riding as a passenger on Edward Corr’s motorcycle at the time of the crash, while Desma Oakes was a passenger on Aaron Perry’s motorcycle.Joshua Morin, 45, of Dalton, Mass., remains in stable condition at Maine Medical Center. Steven Lewis, 58, of Brimfield, Mass., was treated and released from an area hospital, Young said.Volodoymyr Zhukovskyy, 23, an employee of Westfield Transport, a company in Springfield, Mass., has been identified as the driver of the pickup truck that struck the motorcyclists. Zhukovskyy was alone in the truck at the time of the crash, officials said. The National Transportation Safety Board and state and local police are investigating.Young said Sunday she was unable to provide an update on the investigation, or if Zhukovskyy could face charges.

            Marines among 7 dead in Randolph crash; witness describes aftermath“All I can tell you is it’s active and ongoing,” said Young. “There are dozens of agents and officers up in the area working every aspect of this case. State police, local and federal authorities have been at this scene since the time of the accident Friday evening. They have worked through both nights and will continue to work through the hours and days to come.”According to a GoFundMe page set up for the victims, the group was on its way to an American Legion charity event in Gorham.“Our club and the families are going to need help and we cannot do it alone,” a posting at the GoFundMe page states. “Jarheads MC has always been about helping veterans and their families. We are strong enough to get through this, but we ask for and need your support.”The fundraising page, found here https://bit.ly/2ZEIRz6, had received several hundred thousand dollars by Sunday night.Albert Mazza was a member of the southern Maine chapter of Jarheads MC, and president of the entire motorcycle club, according to northern chapter VP Kris Crawford.“Thank you all for your kind messages and support,” read a post on the Napalm Crew, Jarheads MC Facebook page Saturday. “This tragedy marks the beginning of a very trying time for our club, friends, and family. Your support through what is sure to be a very long grieving process is very much appreciated. Semper Fidelis, Till Val Halla.”Mark Ayers is a member of the Jarheads from Massachusetts. In a social media post Sunday, he said in the aftermath of the accident he just stared at his bike for 45 minutes to an hour, unsure what to do.“The pain of the loss I am feeling runs deeper than anything I have ever experienced,” wrote Ayers. “I am all done crying, I don’t know if I could if I wanted to but there is something I do know. Not getting on the bike would be something those I lost would not want to hear, so I threw a leg over and started the bike.”Ayers wrote he rode to a local store for a bottle of water, and felt people looking at him.“A man in a car said to me, ‘Sorry for your loss, my wife and I donated money to the GoFundMe we hope it will help.’ At that moment it seemed to make it OK for others to come forward, all saying the same thing. It seems I still have the ability to cry.”Shortly after the victims were identified, Gov. Chris Sununu directed all flags on public buildings and grounds in the state to fly at half-staff from sunrise to sunset on Monday.“Friday’s tragedy has struck our state and our citizens in a profound way,” Sununu said in a statement. “I want to express our sincerest condolences and prayers to the victims and their families. Words cannot express the grief we all share in the loss of these seven individuals. The state will ensure that the families affected will have the necessary resources to provide closure to this tragic event.”pfeely@unionleader.com"

Chris Sununu. He recognizes the value of passenger rail and has supported it in the past (Amazon proposal) and it is important that he continue to do so and sign SB 241.The product of the Project Development Phase (PDP) will give the legislators the tools and information necessary to make an informed decision.DAN KELLYLilac Court, Nashua"

Dave Lane/Union Leader file















The remaining bills passed in both chambers, but with different language or amendments. Conference committees of House and Senate members managed to come up with common language both could agree to, and each bill can only be voted up or down.The minimum wage bill has been a priority for its chief sponsor, Senate President Donna Soucy, D-Manchester. Senate Bill 10 increases the minimum wage, currently at the federal minimum of $7.25 an hour, to $10 in 2020 and $12 in 2022.The House and Senate agreed with the goal of getting to $12 an hour by 2022, but differed in how to deal with tipped employees.The Senate-passed version of the bill called for a $4-an-hour minimum for tipped employees, while the House wanted the tipped wage set at 50 percent of the minimum wage.Conferees agreed to 45%, which means a tipped wage of $4.50 in 2020 and $5.40 in 2022.If tipped employees fail to earn the equivalent of $12 an hour in any pay period, employers would be required to make up the difference.The Senate also agreed to a House amendment removing an exemption for employers offering at least 10 paid sick days per year.The New Hampshire Lodging and Restaurant Association opposes the conference committee approach to tipped employees, and will urge Gov. Chris Sununu to veto the measure. The governor has said all along he thinks the minimum wage should be left to federal discretion.Gun-free school zonesDemocrats tried in 2018 to get a bill passed that would enable local officials to declare gun-free zones on school property, a law made necessary by the fact that only the state can impose any restrictions on firearms.They couldn’t get a bill through the Republican controlled Legislature, but this year have managed to reconcile differing views among House and Senate Democrats to get a bill to Sununu’s desk.This year’s bill, HB 564, does not leave the matter to local school boards, and instead declares gun-free school zones across the state.“No person shall knowingly carry a firearm on school property, including buildings, grounds, buses and vans,” according to the final version of the bill, which makes violations a Class A misdemeanor.The restriction would not apply to people picking up or dropping off students, as long as the firearm remains in the vehicle, nor would it apply to on-duty law enforcement or military personnel. Anyone authorized by the school board to possess a firearm on school property would also be exempt.The school board could not grant such an exemption, however, without first holding a public hearing.This one is almost certain to be vetoed by Sununu.MacDonald hearingA good crowd is expected for the Wednesday morning public hearing in Executive Council chambers on the nomination of Attorney General Gordon MacDonald to serve as the next chief justice of the state Supreme Court.While MacDonald’s confirmation looks fairly secure, it is in no way guaranteed with three Democrats constituting a majority on the Executive Council.One of those Democrats, Councilor Andru Volinksy, says he’s been frustrated in his efforts to learn how Sununu settled on MacDonald.In a letter to attorney Chuck Douglas, chairman of the Governor’s Judicial Selection Commission, Volinsky asked for details as to how many candidates were interviewed by the commission and on what dates.Douglas responded, “I can confirm that between interviews with prior candidates whose applications were carried forward, interviews with candidates who may have interviewed for more than one level of judgeship ... and interviews with first time candidates, the commission interviewed several candidates for the current Supreme Court and Superior Court openings.”Volinsky called that response inadequate.“It concerns me greatly that the chair of the commission would respond in a fashion that is designed to obscure rather than enlighten the public on this important process of state government,” he said."

Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., will make it official on Monday but he won’t be alone for long.Retired Brig. Gen. Donald Bolduc is expected to announce his candidacy at the VFW Hall in Concord Monday morning.Meanwhile, former New Hampshire House Speaker Bill O’Brien of Nashua confirmed he’ll have his own “major announcement” on July 23.O’Brien is expected at that time to also enter the Republican primary for the U.S. Senate race.“This race will be a great opportunity to compare proven conservatism with aspirational but untested conservatism,” O’Brien said Friday.“Republicans know where unproven promises have gotten them in the past.”A Laconia native, Bolduc’s storied military career includes serving as commander of special operations in Africa.Over 32 years of service he received two awards for valor, five Bronze Star medals, 10 deployments and two Purple Hearts.He was one of the soldiers depicted in “12 Strong,” a movie about a horseback-riding Special Forces team that fought the Taliban in Afghanistan soon after the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001.But Bolduc has gotten even more national attention as an advocate for helping combat soldiers dealing with brain injuries and mental health problems.He was recently featured on an episode of “60 Minutes” as the first and only active duty service officer to admit he had suffered from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.Bolduc said during that episode he was bypassed for a promotion because he had gone public. He said he was told to stop talking about it.This recent program focused on a new therapy known as a stellate ganglion block of SGB, a shot in the neck, that Bolduc said helped “clear the fog” for him and led to wellness.“I think there’s enough evidence out there that this is a valid therapy. And it’s something that works,” Bolduc said.Bolduc has already attracted some prominent support as media consultant Josh McElveen has offered volunteer help.Republican campaign operative Matt Mowers, a former staffer for Trump’s 2016 campaign and senior executive in the State Department, has also offered encouragement to Bolduc.Democratic Party Chairman Raymond Buckley mocked the moves and has maintained Shaheen’s record of service to the state will convince voters to grant her a third six-year term in 2020.“The race on ‘who can hug Trump the tightest’ has begun. Yahoo! #NHPolitics #funtime,” Buckley tweeted.Another Republican considering a Senate run is Bryant “Corky” Messner, a successful trial lawyer from Denver, Colo., who more than a year ago relocated full time to Wolfeboro.Messner has hired Todd Cheewing, the former executive director to the Republican State Committee, as an advisor.“We’re going to have a vigorous and competitive primary and the reason is because this Senate race against Jeanne Shaheen is winnable,” GOP State Chairman Steve Stepanek said.Jay Lucas, a venture capitalist from Portsmouth, has also not ruled out a Senate run in 2020.In 1998, Lucas was the GOP nominee for governor who lost to Shaheen, who that year won a second term as the state’s chief executive.Some national Republicans have encouraged Gov. Chris Sununu to try to oust Shaheen. Sununu, a two-term chief executive, announced last month that he would run again for governor next year.Correction: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that public relations consultant Scott Spradling was associated with retired Brig. Gen. Bolduc’s upcoming campaign.klandrigan@unionleader.com"

“Everyone came together with combined resources to take care of the victims and stabilize an incredibly stressful situation,” Sununu said.The National Transportation Safety Board confirmed it is sending a team that will spend about five days investigating the crash.“We need to not only understand what happened but also why,” said Investigator Kenneth Bragg.Officials said Zhukovskyy was driving the truck with an empty trailer that towed cars for Westfield Transport Inc. of West Springfield, Mass.A man who answered the phone at the business Saturday evening said he can’t talk about the crash.

“It’s too hard. I can’t talk,” he said. “I’m sorry. It’s too much. It’s a nightmare.” Then he hung up.State police immediately closed a section of Route 2 for 12 hours while they processed the scene. Route 2 is an essential route for residents and tourists to get east and west just north of the notches.Kevin Rousseau, a volunteer Randolph firefighter and a part-time police officer, said “it looked like a bomb had gone off” on Route 2, describing an “extensive debris field.”Travis Hood, a carpenter from Berlin, was three cars behind the truck heading toward a campground off Route 2 when he saw the accident unfold in front of him.“The truck went over the yellow line and then was yanked back pretty quick and just mowed down the motorcycles,” Hood said.

He jumped out of his truck and ran to the scene and came upon a man with a severely injured leg.“He was losing a lot of blood and I knew we had to get a tourniquet on him or he’d bleed out. So I got a belt and then he had a knife so I was able to make a hole in the belt so we could pull it real tight,” Hood said.“I told him this was going to hurt a real lot and he screamed when I did it but it had to be done.”Hood went to several other accident victims checking for survivors. He gave CPR for “what felt like five minutes” to another surviving victim.“Even though I knew from the shape of these folks they were deceased, I still had to get a pulse, you know,” Hood said.Then another good Samaritan came up, saying she was a doctor, and Hood went back to the man with the leg injury.“He was looking pale while waiting for the first responders to arrive and he’d clearly lost a lot of blood. I squeezed his hand so hard and said, “Just hang on bro, you’re a strong guy, you’ll get through this,” Hood said.“I could feel some of his strength giving way but stayed with him until we loaded him in the ambulance,” Hood said.He credited his girlfriend, Khloe Lamontagne, who had just graduated as a veterinary assistant, with helping assist and keeping him calm administering first aid.

Since the crash, Hood said the wives of some of the victims called and thanked him for his bravery.“I don’t know where they got my number but there they were on the line thanking me for just doing the best I could. It’s all so hard to get your head around, you know,” Hood said.Miranda Thompson of Manchester was vacationing in the area with her family and came upon the crash moments after it happened.“All of a sudden we saw flames up the road a little bit and we saw debris,” Thompson said.

More injured….We must pray deeply for them and their families….We will be there for them.”State police Capt. Chris Vetter confirmed the deaths late Friday and authorities are still investigating the crash on U.S. Route 2 near Lowe's Garage.“I don’t know that I’ve ever seen a crash with as much loss of life. It’s a pretty significant accident, obviously,” Vetter said.Officials are holding a press briefing on the fatal crash at 4 p.m. Saturday at Coos County Superior Court in Lancaster.

The deadly crash was reported at approximately 6:30 p.m. Friday. According to state police, a 2016 Dodge 2500 pickup truck was traveling west on Route 2 when it collided with several motorcycles heading east.“Initial reports were that it involved a pickup truck and several motorcycles. Upon arrival we found that there were a large number of motorcycles that were involved in the accident as was the pickup truck. We were able to confirm that we have seven fatalities at this point,” Vetter said.Two others were also injured and transported to the Androscoggin Valley Hospital. Another was airlifted to Maine Medical Center.

The cause of the crash remains under investigation. Vetter said State Police were working with local police and the Coos County Attorney’s Office.The Department of Transportation confirmed the road was reopened by 7:30 a.m. Saturday.“There’s quite a bit of work left to be done. Obviously at this point in time our concern is with the victims, the victims’ families and anybody else who was adversely affected by this accident,” Vetter said.Miranda Thompson is vacationing in the area with her family and came upon the crash moments after it happened.“All of a sudden we saw flames up the road a little bit and we saw debris,” said Miranda Thompson of Manchester of the fatal Randolph crash.As she got closer, the Manchester woman realized the seriousness of the crash.

Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims, their families, & first responders who answered the call,"" Sununu said. ""State officials are on the scene & assisting as the situation develops.""Route 2 is an essential route for residents and tourists to get east and west just north of the notches.The National Transportation Safety Board confirmed Saturday mid-morning that it was sending a team to the motorcycle-truck crash near Randolph, NH, to conduct safety investigation.""The team will coordinate with local authorities who are doing their own investigation,"" the NTSB said in a statement."

Chris Sununu signed Senate Bill 239, which will implement a new “blue alert” system to provide critical information to the public.The system will be similar to the “Amber Alert” program used to get information out quickly in the event of a child abduction.Sununu said it’s a system that will be put into place, but one that he hopes won’t have to be used.“It really is about the message that we’re sending to communities, reminding them that when you have police who put their lives on the line for you and your family and your community every single day, that’s an obligation that we (have), whether it’s at the state house or in our own home. We should be standing up for those who are standing up for us,” said Sununu, who signed the bill at the Exeter Police Department while surrounded by local police chiefs, members from New Hampshire State Police and the Rockingham County Sheriff’s Department, and others from the state’s law enforcement community.The alert system will be activated when a law enforcement officer has been killed, injured or is missing.Information would be released to seek the public’s help in locating a suspect with a physical description and details about the vehicle. In the case of a missing officer, the officer’s last known location would be provided to aid in the search.State police will implement the program with the same resources used for the “Amber Alert” system, meaning it won’t require additional funding, officials said.Exeter Police Chief Stephan Poulin said the new system will be important for public safety.“If that person is willing to take the life of an officer, obviously they’re willing to do anything else at that point,” he said.State Police Col. Christopher Wagner said information will be sent using a variety of methods, including NH Alerts, a mobile system that the public can sign up for through www.readynh.gov to get critical information; the Emergency Alert System; Reverse 911; and media sources.“It’s a beautiful state. It really is a safe state, but at the same time, it is not without tragedy. We’ve seen that historically. You look at the national trends in law enforcement and violence against law enforcement is at an all-time high and New Hampshire is no exception,” Wagner said.Newmarket Police Det. Scott Kukesh knows all too well the dangers that face New Hampshire’s law enforcement officers. He was one of four police officers who survived after being shot by the gunman who killed Greenland Police Chief Michael Maloney in 2012.Kukesh attended Friday’s bill signing.“I think society as a whole supports law enforcement, and ultimately people want to do the right thing and help when they can. This enables and empowers them to assist in a timely fashion to possibly identify suspects,” he said.RockinghamNews@unionleader.com"
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,Morse: Sununu veto of budget not 'if' but 'when',"Jun 20, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/politics/state/morse-sununu-veto-of-budget-not-if-but-when/article_f27caaeb-edd0-59e6-aad8-baf76a160fc6.html,"CONCORD — House and Senate negotiators signed off on their version of a two-year state budget for 2020-2021 on Thursday, with warnings from Gov. Chris Sununu of a likely veto.The Democratically controlled conference committee on the budget voted unanimously to send the revenue and spending plan to the full House and Senate for votes next week, after which it will land on Sununu’s desk.He gave every indication that he could not sign it in its current form.“Today in New Hampshire there is a $260 million surplus and the Democrats have put forward a budget that contains a nearly $100 million deficit,” he said.“Critical funding for health care, the opioid crisis, and education are being held hostage by the Democrats in an obsessive and misguided effort to raise taxes. This is irresponsible, and the people of New Hampshire will never support that approach.”The deficit alluded to by Sununu is reflected in the fact that the conference committee budget shows a negative balance of $93 million at the end of fiscal year 2021.The Democrats are counting on the carryover of surplus from previous years to help erase that deficit and end the biennium $24 million in the black after deposits to the Rainy Day Fund.Sununu does not believe any of the surplus from the past two years should be carried over into future budgets, and would dispense it entirely in one-time projects.Democrats are also counting on an additional $90 million by revoking reductions in business taxes approved for 2019.The budget proposed by the governor assumes those tax cuts will remain in place, and it did not contain the increases in educational funding or Medicaid rates contained in the House-Senate budget.Sununu’s budget presented in February projected a Rainy Day Fund Balance of $137 million at the end of the two-year period, while the budget approved by the committee of conference projects a Rainy Day Fund balance of $118 million.The governor called for $4.97 billion in spending over the two years from state taxes and fees (not including federal funds), while the conference committee budget would spend $5.54 billion.The committee of conference supports that higher spending with higher revenue projections. In 2021, for example, the governor anticipates $2.5 billion in state-generated revenue, while the committee of conference predicts revenue at $2.8 billion. (For budget highlights, read this article on unionleader.com)“People expect us to work together and they have delivered divided government,” said Sen. Dan Feltes, D-Concord, a member of the conference committee after the vote.“No one is getting everything they want in this budget. It has been a series of compromises. I appreciate our House colleagues for their compromises and hope the governor recognizes that no one gets everything they want in this process.”Democrats abandoned their proposals for a paid family medical leave plan and a capital gains tax to better fund education in the hope of getting Sununu’s signature. Sununu has been adamant that he will not agree to changes in the 2019 business tax rates.Senate Republican Leader Chuck Morse, R-Salem, suggested a Sununu veto is not a matter of “if,” but “when.”“I will proudly support Gov. Sununu when he vetoes this budget, which squanders the revenue surplus from the Republican budget, raises taxes and contains a $93 million structural deficit,” he said.“The budget being proposed increases business taxes, threatening an economy with the second lowest unemployment rate in the nation and the highest per capita income. The spending decisions in other parts of the budget make the increase in education funding unsustainable and will only lead to an income tax or capital gains tax. Promises that have been made by Concord Democrats in this budget cannot be kept.”Democrats say the revocation of business tax cuts approved for 2019 is not a tax increase, but a continuation of 2018 rates.If the budget is vetoed, state agencies will continue to operate at current funding levels through what is known as a continuing resolution until a deal is struck.dsolomon@unionleader.com"
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,State still trying to reach 20K on Medicaid work requirement,"Jun 20, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/politics/state/state-still-trying-to-reach-k-on-medicaid-work-requirement/article_6d7b56a7-ccff-5a2b-a503-6f0becf9fd0c.html,"CONCORD — State officials have been unable to connect with about 20,000 people enrolled in New Hampshire’s expanded Medicaid program who might be required to comply with new work requirements or lose their health insurance.As a result, legislation was amended by a House-Senate conference committee on Thursday to grant Health and Human Services Commissioner Jeffrey Meyers broad powers to exempt people from the work requirement, which Republicans in the state Legislature had demanded be included in the expanded Medicaid program.The amendment will still have to be passed by the full Senate and House and signed into law by Gov. Chris Sununu, who has supported the work requirement. He told reporters on Wednesday that the state is doing everything it can to reach the target population, but time is running out as a July 7 deadline approaches.“The department (Health and Human Services) has done a very good job in their attempts to reach out to this population,” Sununu said. “But there are still 20,000 out there. It is a big number and something we have to be aggressive about getting down and making sure these folks enter the program like they are supposed to.”The new work or community engagement requirement kicked in as of June 1, requiring anyone covered by expanded Medicaid, known as Granite Advantage, to complete 100 hours of work or approved community activities each month to maintain medical coverage, unless they are exempt due to medical frailty or other circumstances listed in the law.Meyers says the department has been able to determine that about 22,000 of the 50,000-plus enrolled in Granite Advantage are exempt from the work requirement for various reasons.“For the month of June, that leaves about 27,000 others,” he said. “About 7,400 of that 27,000 are in compliance because we have wage information that confirms that, which leaves about 20,000.”Outreach efforts by the state and its vendors included letters and phone calls, as well as texts, emails, in-person information sessions, videos, local meetings with beneficiaries, community organizations and providers, and interactions with DHHS client services staff.DHHS spent $100,000 on a contract with a company called Maximus Health to help with the outreach. When asked if the agency was satisfied with the company’s efforts, Meyers said, “Of course we are.”“They made more than 50,000 calls,” he said.












        

        
            Spreading the word on Medicaid work requirement proves challenging

The new work or community engagement requirement kicked in as of June 1.




The problem, according to Meyers, is that many calls went unanswered, and in cases where Maximus was able to reach people, they weren’t always willing to cooperate. Many of those who were reached declined to provide their Medicaid ID number over the phone.“We did the outreach, but if people on the other side for whatever reason don’t want to talk we can’t force them into a conversation,” he said.A federal judge in March blocked work requirements that the Trump administration authorized for Arkansas and Kentucky. A group of plaintiffs, including New Hampshire Legal Assistance, has appealed to the same judge to block the work requirement in the Granite State as well.Republican Sen. Jeb Bradley, chief architect of the expanded Medicaid compromise with Democrats, said he would support the changes to the work requirement in the final version of SB 290, given the uncertainty surrounding coverage for 20,000.“When you look at the 20,000, I’m sure there are a lot who are working the requisite number of hours or they have one of the exemptions, so I suspect the number is far less than 20,000 at end of day,” he said. “I see this as a way of preserving the work requirement, but also ensuring that commissioner Meyers has the tools to make sure we can effectively implement it.”The provisions of SB 290 expire on July 2021, after which a new legislature will have to decide how to proceed, assuming the work requirement survives legal challenges.Everyone in the Granite Advantage program has until July 7 to report their hours worked, qualified activities or reasons for an exemption.“We have a plan for pulling all that together, entering it into our system every day,” said Meyers. “We will then determine how many are in compliance and how many are not, and then I will be able to make a judgment about whether or not people need to be exempted until they can be reached or for any period of time, up to July 2021.”dsolomon@unionleader.com"
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,NH Voices: Shannon McGinley -- 'Feel good' transgender legislation has destructive consequences,"Jun 20, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/opinion/columnists/nh-voices-shannon-mcginley----feel-good-transgender/article_4f9bafd9-cb6e-5cda-aea7-778c2a26503d.html,"NOT SURPRISINGLY over the past couple of years, our state and its new democratic majorities in the House and Senate have eagerly jumped on the transgender bandwagon.This year, we have been following no fewer than five separate bills, all designed to mainstream and champion individuals who self-identify as transgender, or other than their biological sex — an estimated 0.6 percent of the population and a growing movement, especially among our youth. Using words such as “nondiscrimination” and “protections” feels right and good, but they are far from benign.Taken on their own merit, each of these bills brings not only confusion but presents real threats to the viability of New Hampshire’s facilities and programs. Put them together, and the result is an incoherent construct that threatens our state educational, statistical, and religious institutions.Consider these legislative building blocks:SB 263 holds schools legally and financially responsible for school employees’ discrimination against students on grounds including “gender identity.” The bill leaves discrimination undefined.HB 608 is sweeping legislation extending across more areas of New Hampshire law, adding “gender identity” to the list of protected groups.HB 446 establishes procedures for individuals to amend their birth certificates retroactively, changing the biological sex to a self-selected gender designation.HB 669 allows for the category of “X” on a driver’s license, as an alternative to M (for male) or F (for female).HB 383 expands our state law against discrimination (RSA 354-4) to apply to any public or non-public school that receives public funds to include “gender identity.”Not surprisingly, all these bills are partisan, enthusiastically sponsored and pushed through by the Democrats controlling the House and Senate — any other voices have been neatly sidelined.In our legislative halls, sex has now taken a back seat to the concept of “gender identity.”The phrase “sex assigned at birth” neatly skirts the inconvenient truth of biological sex, referring to sex as if it were some random determination with no relation to our species, reproduction, or natural law. The inherent conflict of sex and “assigned” gender will collide as individuals will be able to claim inclusion based on self-definition.The world of women’s sports is already being turned on its head by transgender athletes who are able to leverage their natural physical advantages to take national and world titles away from their biologically female competitors.Four of these bills have passed the House and Senate, lacking only Gov. Chris Sununu’s signature to become law in the Granite State.The fifth bill, HB 383, has been retained for further action next year. So, what will these legislative pieces look like as a whole when the full impact of these laws, if enacted, is felt in New Hampshire? Consider:With broad non-discrimination laws enacted to cover a small self-defined minority, our schools will not be able to protect our children from sharing facilities with the opposite sex or even being in a classroom with age-inappropriate peers.Any private or religious school that receives state-sponsored monies, including funds from an ETC (Education Tax Credit) Scholarship, will be vulnerable to legal action.Sports teams will be required to accept students on the basis of non-biological gender.Medical providers will not have access to important biological information for some patients, paving the way for potential misdiagnoses and ineffective/harmful treatment protocols.Multiple scientific studies have demonstrated that the majority of children resolve their early gender dysphoria by adulthood. By reinforcing a child’s early feelings of gender confusion, New Hampshire could be committing him/her down a road of permanent and potentially harmful medical intervention.In a state where our institutions and legal system will stand firmly on the side of recognizing children as permanently transgender, the rights of New Hampshire parents will come sharply into question when they find themselves stripped of their ability to make the care decisions they feel are best for children suffering from gender dysphoria.One irony of the rise of gender-neutral and transsexual identity questions is their reliance on traditional sexual norms as a baseline.Moreover, the concept “gender fluidity” is inherently contradicted by the culture’s drive to declare an individual’s biological sex a mistake and hurry children and adults down a path of permanent chemical and surgical alteration.When our children are struggling with their sexual identity, failing to address the whole person in favor of such life-altering and drastic measures is simply wrong.For us, it is simple. We believe in the inherent dignity of each and every person. We recognize the biology of two sexes — male and female. We also believe in the equality of the two sexes as God has created them — each bringing their own complementary strengths and gifts.For our state to deny these realities is to invite chaos from order."

Chris Sununu will sign, even though the budget they propose still includes revocation of business tax cuts that Sununu wants to see kept in place.Sununu on Wednesday said he could live with a budget that eliminates business tax cuts promised in 2021, but could not sign a budget that eliminates cuts in business tax rates that took effect on Jan. 1 of this year, calling that a tax increase.“I think the door is open there. If they are going to keep business taxes where they are, there’s an opportunity,” Sununu told reporters in a brief press conference.“We have a $260 million budget surplus. How does the government of New Hampshire go out tell the people they have to pay more? The people of New Hampshire won’t accept tax increases, nor should they.”Senate Democratic Majority Leader Dan Feltes, D-Concord, said businesses don’t calculate their taxes for 2019 until 2020, and paying those taxes at the same rates paid in 2018 does not constitute a tax increase.“Senate and House Democrats gave Gov. Sununu everything he wanted in this budget except for his desire to further cut taxes benefiting largely big out-of-state corporations,” said Feltes.“He shouldn’t hold hostage child protection, mental health, opioid epidemic, education funding and meaningful property tax relief because he didn’t get everything he wanted.”Senate Finance Committee Chair Lou’ D’Allesandro, D-Manchester, said failure to bring 2019 business tax rates back to 2018 levels would force lawmakers to find $90 million in cuts.Housing Appeals BoardIn some legislative horse-trading, House members agreed to include a new statewide Housing Appeals Board in the budget, in return for Senate agreement on a $400,000 project to combat invasive aquatic species like milfoil in the state’s waterways.Negotiators agreed to raise the smoking age in New Hampshire to 21 and to add e-cigarettes to the state’s tobacco tax, with no increase in the tax rate.A bill in the Senate increasing the smoking age (SB 248), and one in the House to add e-cigarettes to the tobacco tax (HB 680) were both retained in committee, but will now become law if the budget is adopted.The final version of the legislative budget also includes $20 million a year in unrestricted aid to cities and towns to spend as they see fit, based on a formula that takes into account a community’s public school enrollment and the number of children on free and reduced lunch.Negotiators could not agree to the creation of a new Citizens Right-to-Know Appeals Commission and ombudsman, so that idea died on the table.House Republican Leader Dick Hinch, R-Merrimack, said his caucus stands ready to support Sununu in a budget veto, as Democrats do not have the necessary two-thirds majority to override on their own.“Republicans just can’t support raising taxes on businesses at a time when our continued economic success hinges upon our competitiveness to retain jobs here. We made a promise to job creators two years ago, and they expect us to follow through,” he said.If a new budget is not adopted by the July 1 start of the state’s fiscal year, state agencies will continue to operate at current funding levels on what’s known as a continuing resolution.dsolomon@unionleader.com"

Maggie Hassan, D-NH, was charged in federal court Wednesday.We had already known this former aide, Samantha Deforest Davis, who had worked as a staff assistant from August 2017 until last December was involved in this case of stealing government documents and targeting Republican senators with online threats.











Hassan had learned last December from Capitol Police that Davis was linked to the work of another ex-Hassan aide, Jackson Cosko, who dispensed the personal information of several Republican senators online during the confirmation fight last year over Supreme Court Justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh.As soon as Hassan learned this, Davis was fired from the staff, officials said.Davis had only been a person of interest who wasn't charged until Wednesday, the day Cosko received a four-year federal prison sentence for his felony crimes in a U.S. District Court hearing in Washington, D.C.""Senator Hassan is grateful to Capitol Police and the U.S. Attorney's Office for their work to bring this individual to justice for the crimes he committed,"" said Aaron Jacobs, Hassan's communications director.Prosecutors asked Judge Thomas Hogan to sentence Cosko to nearly five years in prison; Cosko's lawyers had said they would accept a two-year prison term.In April, Cosko pleaded guilty to five federal felonies.She was charged with two misdemeanors, one evidence of tampering and then aiding and abetting computer fraud in connection with the scheme; officials said she was expected to plead guilty to these offenses.Cosko was fired last year after he repeatedly used Davis' keys to get into the office, copied sensitive data and then installed keyloggers that allowed him to capture the computer passwords of Hassan staffers when they logged in.According to court documents, Davis was involved with the computer crimes from last July 26 to Oct. 2.""Senator Hassan appreciates the work of Capitol Police and the U.S. Attorney's Office in pursuing justice in this case,"" Jacobs said of the charges against Davis.The witness-tampering charge stemmed from Oct. 3, when the indictment said Davis wiped down keyboards and restarted computers to hide evidence of Cosko's crimes.Republican State Chairman Stephen Stepanek said Hassan has to own up to gross mismanagement of her office.""Senator Maggie Hassan's office is an absolute disgrace to the state of New Hampshire. The recent Politico report revealing that a second former Senator Hassan staffer was charged in the doxing case is, unfortunately, not surprising,"" Stepanek said in a statement.""Senator Hassan has hired multiple individuals so lacking in judgement they would break multiple laws in her office. The question remains to be answered: What did Senator Hassan know, and when did she know it? Senator Hassan needs to be held accountable for her gross mismanagement. To ensure this will never happen again, I am calling for a complete and total investigation into every member of her office.""Bullock lands top NH talentMontana Gov.

Sununu.The event from 2-4 p.m. is at the barn of Jim and Patti Betti at 218 Wallis Road in Rye.Tickets are $80 apiece or $160 per couple and people can spend anywhere from $50 to $1,000 to get their place in a birthday memento book.""The funds raised will make sure the NH GOP has the resources to take back the State House, Senate, and Executive Council next year, and save our New Hampshire Advantage,"" said Chris Sununu in an invitation to the event.Court fight over Medicaid work mandate goes onA coalition of groups for the poor and uninsured have asked a federal court judge in the District of Columbia to strike down the Trump administration's approval of a Medicaid waiver for this state to permit a work or community service requirement for most low-income adults in the Medicaid expansion population.The National Health Program, New Hampshire Legal Assistance and lawyers for the National Center for Law and Economic Justice filed these motions representing Medicaid recipients, who they said would face hardship if the waiver is permitted to stand.These lawyers maintain New Hampshire's waiver was illegal because a federal judge had already rejected a work requirement for the state of Arkansas.Meanwhile Sununu must decide in the coming weeks whether he will veto legislation that would eliminate the work requirement if it leads to a significant enough number of residents getting kicked off the program.Pick of AG as Sup. Ct. chief justice looks solidThe political reality is governors invariably get confirmed their nominees — good, bad or somewhere in between — for the state's highest court.This is likely to happen next month when the Executive Council votes on the nomination of Attorney General Gordon MacDonald to be the next chief justice.While MacDonald politically had an early career as a partisan Republican staffer and fundraiser, he's sure got an eclectic group of admirers in the New Hampshire bar.Jay Surdukowski of Concord, a Democratic political activist, organized a lengthy letter in support of MacDonald from lawyers that included former Democratic Gov. John Lynch's attorney general, Mike Delaney; ex-Democratic Party lawyer Wilbur Glahn; ex-Lynch Legal Counsel Kate Hanna; and former Obama administration U.S. Attorney John Kacavas.MacDonald has had his critics. A pair of lawyers active in the reproductive rights movement question whether MacDonald would support legal restrictions on abortion, given his past political associations.Former Democratic Party chairman Kathy Sullivan said MacDonald would become the first person to become chief justice of the court in nearly 70 years to have had no judicial experience.""There are a number of critical issues that will be argued before the Supreme Court in the next few years — education funding, voting rights, potential additional litigation involving Northern Pass, and the like. New Hampshire deserves a Supreme Court that will not look at these matters through a partisan eye, but one that will interpret the law as objectively as possible,"" Sullivan wrote in an op-ed for the Union Leader.""The Executive Council should not wave this nomination through, but should take a hard look at whether Sununu is imposing an ideological stamp on what has been a non-political body.""Dems promote minimum-wage hike petitionNew Hampshire Democrats collected in a single day several hundred petitions Tuesday in support of legislation to raise the state's minimum wage.The petition urges Sununu to sign the measure, something this two-term Republican has not at all supported.The state GOP has called the bill a ""job-killing policy.""The petition points out Sununu, unlike his last two predecessors, had taken the governor's full salary of $132,500, which is $22,000 more than former Gov. Hassan received.Democrats criticized Sununu for also proposing to hike his salary to more than $140,000.Sununu's staff pointed out the higher salary for the governor was mandated by state law to be included with his two-year state budget plan.That's because it represents what was the result of a collective bargaining agreement that affected not only non-political but also politically appointed or elected state workers, like the state's chief executive.House and Senate negotiators are expected to come to an agreement on a compromise bill to increase the minimum wage from the federal minimum of $7.25 per hour to $12 an hour by Jan. 1, 2022.Gillibrand pushes family rights agendaWhile campaigning in New London late last week, 2020 presidential candidate and U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-NY., promoted her Family Bill of Rights plan. It includes a federal paid leave law, universal pre-K, improving maternal care, better rural access to obstetricians and gynecologists and affordable nursery care for newborns.""Paid family leave and, in particular, paid maternity leave, is fundamental to a healthy society,"" said Dr. Oge Young, who served on a panel Gillibrand hosted.""It provides the framework for a precious, priceless childhood -- the foundation on which responsible, healthy, caring adults grow. Senator Gillibrand has long been a leader on this issue fighting to establish national paid leave since 2013.""State Rep. Allison Nutting-Wong, D-Nashua and an expectant mother, also praised the plan.""We need leaders who will focus on the real issues facing New Hampshire families, and Senator Gillibrand’s Family Bill of Rights platform does just that. From improving access to maternal care to establishing national paid leave, Gillibrand’s proposal offers innovative and thorough solutions to problems that have been ignored for too long,"" Nutting-Wong said.Kuster names new spokeswomanRep. Annie Kuster, D-NH., is making changes in her staff, with communications director Nick Brown returning to New Hampshire to become district director.Replacing Brown as Kuster's chief spokesperson in DC is Jen Fox, who had worked with Rep. Lucy McBath, D-Ga.Brown's move up was the result of some shifting in Hassan's office, as her own state director, Mike Ollen, recently left to head up the presidential campaign of Beto O'Rourke.Hassan tapped Kuster's former state director, Corey Garry, to become deputy director of her office.Jennifer Kuzma was named by Hassan to be her state director.U.S. House advances Hassan crackdown on Big PharmaHassan has worked on bipartisan legislation with Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., to close a loophole in the Medicaid rebate program that permits pharmaceutical companies to overcharge taxpayers.On Wednesday night the House passed a companion bill to this Fair and Accurate Medicaid pricing Act of 2019.""I am excited that the House of Representatives passed our bipartisan bill to prevent big pharmaceutical companies from taking advantage of a loophole and overcharging taxpayers for Medicaid costs,"" Hassan said.

Chris Sununu needed no other reason for vetoing the Democrats’ current budget plan, its use of taxpayer funds for abortions would be sufficient.Even as advances in science show more and more clearly that unborn babies are very much human babies, alive and kicking, the pro-abortionists are pushing their agenda. That is why one sees all the Democratic presidential candidates, including Joe Biden, vowing to repeal the Hyde Amendment.And it is why New Hampshire’s Democrats are trying to overturn the law here while they have the legislative majority.For good reason, both the national Hyde Amendment and New Hampshire state law prohibit using tax dollars to pay for abortions. No matter where one stood on the divisive issue, most on either side have long agreed that those who are opposed to abortion should not have their tax money paying for it.That agreement no longer stands. The Democrats’ state budget proposal would repeal New Hampshire’s law. They would not only spend your tax dollars for abortion-on-demand; they would wildly increase the public funding for Planned Parenthood.One guess what that Orwellian-named outfit would do with the money.Anyone who is pro-life ought to be reaching out to urge Gov. Sununu to stand tall on this issue. Any legislator who voted to repeal the death penalty for hardened killers needs to explain how he or she could possibly endorse funding for the taking of innocent life."

Chris Sununu, the N.H. House, and the N.H. Senate for their incredible bipartisan support of increased funding for New Hampshire’s domestic and sexual violence crisis centers in the state budget.Despite having an otherwise relatively low crime rate, New Hampshire has some of the highest rates of sexual violence in the country. Crisis centers work with victims to address trauma before it manifests in very costly social services further down the line. Working at a crisis center, I’ve seen firsthand the difference prevention and intervention can make with survivors, and especially with children. An investment in our community crisis centers is an investment in people: our friends, neighbors, and loved ones. These centers provide critical, life-saving services to victims and their children to get them safe and to rebuild their lives, free from trauma and abuse.It’s time to stop throwing money at the bottom of the cliff and to start investing in our community domestic and sexual assault crisis centers that ensure traumatized people become not only safer — but also self-sufficient. These centers literally mean the difference between life and death, every day, for more than 15,000 Granite Staters every year.I applaud the governor and the legislature for leaving partisan politics aside to prioritize meaningful funding for these critical resources in our communities.

Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,Kathy Sullivan: Is Sununu making Supreme Court political?,"Jun 19, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/opinion/columnists/kathy-sullivan-is-sununu-making-supreme-court-political/article_00fba78f-aa01-59be-83a6-37fa33445129.html,"GOV. CHRIS SUNUNU recently announced his nomination of Attorney General Gordon MacDonald to become chief justice of the state’s Supreme Court.











It is Sununu’s third appointment to the court. None had prior experience on the bench, whether in the circuit court or the Superior Court. While prior judicial experience is not required, that lack of experience is not typical.Sununu passed over a number of judges who are at least as qualified, if not more so, to serve as chief justice. It is the custom for the chief justice to come from within the ranks of the Supreme Court itself. Current Chief Justice Robert Lynn was a justice for seven years. His predecessor, the trailblazing Linda Dalianis, first served as an associate justice, following a number of years as a marital master and a Superior Court judge.I looked up the records going back to Justice Frank Kennison, who served as an associate justice for five years before his appointment as chief in 1952, a capacity in which he served for 25 years. Every chief justice had prior judicial experience, and all had been an associate justice before appointment as chief.So, why is Sununu breaking a tradition that goes back at least 67 years?When I started asking this question, some of my Republican friends accused me of trying to politicize the nomination. MacDonald went to a great law school, they said, he is a good guy, he works hard, he has served on various committees, he was a partner in a large law firm.I agree that MacDonald has excellent credentials as an attorney — especially the great law school (we share an alma mater). But the Executive Council needs to take a hard look at this nomination. Not because I want to politicize the Supreme Court, but because I am afraid Sununu is trying to do just that.The modern New Hampshire Supreme Court has not been a political court. When Linda Dalianis was appointed chief, I did not know or care what her party registration was. While I may have disagreed with the court’s decisions from time to time, I never felt that it was driven by a partisan ideology.While the court always has a mix of Democrats and Republicans, Sununu’s nominees are more that just registered Republicans. They all have been generous donors to the GOP and/or its candidates. According to Open Secrets, MacDonald’s federal contributions alone total more than $20,000.There is nothing disqualifying about making political donations. However, the level of MacDonald’s is significant.In addition, Sununu’s Supreme Court nominees appear to come from the Republican Party’s more conservative wing. Both MacDonald and Justice Bobbie Hantz Marconi are former members of the board of directors of the Josiah Bartlett Center, a very conservative New Hampshire think tank. Justice Hantz Marconi also was the Republican Party’s executive director back in the 1980s, and once ran to be the state GOP chair. MacDonald lists the NH GOP as one of his former clients.The Bartlett Center has been heavily funded by the Koch brothers. One of their foundations contributed more than $280,000 to the center during MacDonald’s first two years on the board. Groups affiliated with the Kochs have been trying to elect conservative judges in some states where judges are elected.There are a number of critical issues that will be argued before the Supreme Court in the next few years — education funding, voting rights, potential additional litigation involving Northern Pass, and the like.New Hampshire deserves a Supreme Court that will not look at these matters through a partisan eye, but one that will interpret the law as objectively as possible.The Executive Council should not wave this nomination through, but should take a hard look at whether Sununu is imposing an ideological stamp on what has been a non-political body.Kathy Sullivan is the former chairman of the New Hampshire Democratic Party."
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,Budget writers strike deal on $17.5 million Secure Psychiatric Unit,"Jun 18, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/politics/state/budget-writers-strike-deal-on-million-secure-psychiatric-unit/article_86cdf69e-fffd-520f-8466-e3b4feab74eb.html,"CONCORD — House and Senate budget writers on Tuesday agreed to meet Gov. Chris Sununu halfway on his proposal for a new forensic psychiatric hospital to serve some of the state’s most challenging mental health patients.In the second day of a three-day budget conference between House and Senate members, both sides agreed to include the Senate proposal for a $17.5 million, 25-bed Secure Psychiatric Unit on the grounds of New Hampshire Hospital, the state’s existing psychiatric hospital in Concord.That’s smaller than the $26 million, 60-bed facility proposed by Sununu, but more than what the House proposed.""The information received in the Senate indicated that a 60-bed SPU would cost $48 million,"" said state Sen. Dan Feltes, D-Concord. ""Sununu simply proposed $26 million.""State Rep. Renny Cushing, D-Hampton, has lobbied for years to have the state move patients who have had no involvement with the criminal justice system out of the Secure Psychiatric Unit (SPU) at the state prison, where they are housed with convicted criminals.“There are those who would argue for a much larger facility, but the goal has been to take care of that population in the state prison, about 20 give or take, of folks with mental illness who are being criminalized by being in prison,” said Feltes.The Senate agreed with a House proposal to move children out of the Children’s Wing at New Hampshire Hospital to free up anywhere from 32 to 48 beds for adults, in the hope of easing some of the boarding in hospital emergency rooms for patients awaiting admission to the state facility.“Given information we had and the work we did, we think this is a reasonable proposal and in line with what Rep. Cushing and the governor have suggested,” said Feltes.Both proposals will now appear on the budget to be voted on by the full House and Senate on June 27.No deal on capital gainsThe two sides could not agree on a House proposal for a 5 percent capital gains tax to enhance education funding.Rep. Richard Ames, D-Jaffrey, argued for the idea, which he described as an extension of the existing state tax on interest and dividend income that would net the state an additional $150 million a year to address education funding.“The House worked hard on this through Ways and Means, and it came to the floor of the House where there was a solid vote for it,” said Ames. The bill cleared the House 199-143 in February with only two Republican votes.Senate Finance Chair Lou D’Allesandro, D-Manchester, was unequivocal about the Senate’s opposition to the idea, which Sununu has said would result in a budget veto.“The Senate’s position is quite the opposite,” D’Allesandro said after Ames finished his presentation.“We thank you for your hard work and deliberations, but the Senate rejects the capital gains tax. We have found a way to fund this budget with existing revenues and tax reform. I don’t think capital gains is a viable solution at this point in time, and the Senate rejects it.”Housing appeals boardThe House was equally adamant in rejecting a Housing Appeals Board that could override the decisions of local land-use boards in the interest of promoting affordable housing.“This creates a separate appeals process as an alternative to Superior Court, to have timely appeals for workforce housing and affordable housing,”” said Feltes.“I understand there are some municipalities that don’t support this, however, I want to make it very clear to them and others who oppose the concept, there is no substantial change in the (workforce housing) law. It creates a separate appeals process. That’s it,” he said.“The notion that this is tearing apart local control is not true. What is true is a separate, expedited appeals process, because when you are planning some of these places for workforce housing, you can’t wait three to five years for an appeal at Superior Court to be done.”Rep. Pat Lovejoy, D-Stratham, said the House is strongly opposed.“To say there is a groundswell against this in the House would be putting it mildly,” she said.“I fully support the idea behind this, to deal with affordable, workforce housing, but I think we may be using an ax when we should be using a scalpel. The feeling this is overriding local control is a strong feeling among House members of both parties.”Sen. Cindy Rosenwald, R-Nashua, said not all communities are opposed.“I’ve gotten emails against this, but the city of Nashua strongly supports this being in here and funded,” she said. “There are communities that think this is important to help us get more affordable housing.”Anything the two sides can’t agree to by the end of deliberations will not appear in the final version of the budget that goes before both chambers.Conferees agreeHouse and Senate negotiators agreed on several points, including:• A commission to study long-term solutions to education funding, with a $500,000 budget.• $8 million in funding for short-term increases in Medicaid rates paid to mental health and substance abuse service providers.• $3 million in additional funds for the Granite Shield drug enforcement program.• $450,000 for emergency housing in Manchester for people in recovery from addiction.Most matters related to education funding were left for Wednesday.dsolomon@unionleader.com"

Cory Booker backs up his talk with genuine action. I know this because I am working as a paid summer intern on his campaign here in my home state.As a college student, there were a lot of options for me when I was thinking about interning this summer. But my clear first choice was Cory for many reasons, particularly his leadership on gun violence prevention and criminal justice reform.However, speaking practically, there was one other factor that influenced my decision. Cory pays his interns — which not all campaigns do. I earn $15 an hour, which is more than double our state’s minimum wage.Paying interns opens up this critical professional development experience to students whose economic circumstances do not allow them to work for free. In fact, I believe — and so does Cory — that all work should be paid, and that jobs should pay people enough to live their lives.I urge all of the presidential candidates to follow Cory’s lead by offering meaningful internships at a livable wage, and I urge leaders like Gov. Chris Sununu to support legislation that would raise the minimum wage for all Granite Staters.SARAH GUDASConcord"

Chris Sununu can sign, House-Senate budget writers did not get off to a good start on Monday, agreeing to revocation of business tax cuts previously approved for 2019 and 2021.Sununu calls that a tax increase, and promises a veto.According to existing law, the Business Profits Tax (BPT) went from 7.9% to 7.7% on Jan. 1, 2019, while the Business Enterprise Tax (BET) — essentially a payroll tax — went from 0.675% to 0.6%.On Jan. 1, 2021, the BPT is scheduled to go down to 7.5% and the BET to 0.5% — cuts that will now not take place if Democrats in the state Legislature have their way.That was one of several matters settled as House and Senate conferees met in the first of three sessions to merge their dueling versions of the state budget into a single revenue and spending plan for the next two years that they can send to Sununu.On their first day of negotiations, they also agreed on revenue projections for fiscal years 2020 and 2021, approved all the budget items upon which there was immediate agreement, and identified the contentious issues that will have to be resolved on Tuesday and Wednesday.The goal is to have a budget ready for House and Senate votes on June 27, the last regularly scheduled session day.“The House and Senate are working hard to address the needs of the people of New Hampshire, and I’m certain we will produce a budget at the end of the Committee of Conference that we will be proud of and able to support,” said state Rep. Mary Jane Wallner, D-Concord. “Will we be able to please everyone? Probably not. But we will make every effort to find compromise and do what is best for New Hampshire.”In her capacity as chairman of the House Finance Committee, Wallner presides over the joint House-Senate budget deliberations with help from Senate Finance Chairman Lou D’Allesandro, D-Manchester. There are five House members and four Senators on the negotiating committee, with one Republican, Sen. John Reagan, R-Deerfield.“We have to come to a consensus on a document that does good things for all of the people,” said D’Allesandro. “That’s why we’re here, that’s what we’re trying to do, and hopefully that will happen.”The conference committee quickly agreed to revenue numbers that are not that far off from Sununu’s budget. The Senate conceded to the House revenue estimates, which were $15 million higher, for a total of $5.2 billion from state sources.Most of the balance will come from federal programs, particularly in the areas of health and human services, education and transportation.Agreement was quickly reached on allowing sports gambling, funding the Alcohol Abuse Prevention and Treatment Fund and the Safe Stations programs in Manchester and Nashua; and appropriations for new child protective service workers and supervisors in the Division for Children, Youth and Families.House and Senate conferees also agreed to repeal a law prohibiting reproductive health facilities from using state funds to provide abortion services.Still to be resolved are conflicting House-Senate positions on plans for education funding, mental health beds, a new forensic psychiatric hospital, imposition of the tobacco tax on e-cigarettes, college tuition assistance, Medicaid rate increases and the income and dividends tax proposed by the House.The current two-year budget expires on June 30, and unless a new budget is signed into law by July 1, state agencies will continue to operate on existing spending levels. None of the new programs to fight opioid abuse, invest in mental health treatment or enhance educational funding would be funded until the new budget takes effect.dsolomon@unionleader.com"

It records your electricity usage, and someone from the utility comes to read it so you can pay your bill accordingly.But legislation that has passed the House and Senate and is now awaiting Gov. Chris Sununu’s signature could turn electric meters into something consumers pay more attention to as they try to lower their electric bills.SB 284 would require the creation of a statewide utility database that would allow customers to access and use information from their electric meters about how and when they consume energy.“Data access and data sharing are essential if consumers are to take full advantage of what the 21st century grid has to offer,” said Consumer Advocate D. Maurice “Don” Kreis, whose office represents the interests of residential utility customers in New Hampshire.“If this bill becomes law, ratepayers in the Granite State will for the first time be able to share their usage data with service providers who can save them money. That’s a big deal.”Kreis requested the legislation in his role as consumer advocate, and the bill has been championed by Sen. Martha Fuller Clark, D-Portsmouth, in the House, and Rep. Kat McGhee, D-Hollis, in the Senate.Thanks to emerging technologies and deregulation, competitive firms vying to be your energy supplier now have the capacity to deliver savings through services like energy efficiency retrofits, solar panels, battery storage, and energy management systems with features like smart thermostats.“And by ‘real value’ I mean: save customers money and give them more choices,” said Kreis.“But,” he added, “to deliver as much of that real value as possible, these competitive firms need robust data about how and when their customers and prospective customers are using electricity. The statewide utility data platform would make that data available and usable, subject to individual customers granting permission.”Ready access to customer usage data will also enable what’s known as “municipal aggregation,” in which participating cities and towns become the default provider of electricity within their borders.Under SB 284, the state’s three investor-owned utilities (Eversource, Liberty and Unitil) will have to develop and operate the database, but the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) will first have to put rules in place to assure oversight.The PUC would also have to determine that benefits to consumers exceed the cost of the platform, a critical protection given widespread concerns about high energy costs.Kries credited OCA Director of Finance James Brennan, who came to the OCA six years ago with a background in information technology, with helping the office make data access a top legislative priority for the past session.“Jim has taught us, and now he has successfully taught legislators as well, that reforms like these will really make a difference for ratepayers,” Kreis said.“In a perfect world, the utilities would simply develop a platform like this on their own,” Kreis added. “But in the real world, they need encouragement because efforts to bolster access to non-utility service providers runs counter to the traditional utility business model.“I hasten to add, though, that in the case of SB 284 our utilities have been interested and open-minded— which is an encouraging sign as we look ahead to the grid of the future.”During hearings on the bill, utility representatives expressed concerns about privacy and security, and the costs of setting up and maintaining such a program.A representative for Eversource, the state’s largest distribution utility, said the company already provides several methods for its customers to access their own data and to save costs on their energy usage.dsolomon@unionleader.com"

Chris Sununu signed a bill Friday making the red-tailed hawk New Hampshire’s official state raptor.The signing was held at Lincoln Akerman School, where seven fourth-graders first began their campaign to designate the hawk as the state raptor.It was an endeavor that initially saw defeat when lawmakers rejected the first bill in 2015, but the students revived their effort last year and convinced legislators to pass House Bill 280.“This journey has been all about these students and getting this done,” Sununu said before signing the bill surrounded by those students, who will head off to high school in the fall, and Scarlet, a red-tailed hawk owned by Auburn resident Rita Tulloh, a member of The New Hampshire Falconers Association.Several legislators attended the bill signing to congratulate the students for their determination to get the bill passed.

Students from Lincoln Akerman School in Hampton Falls who fought to make the red-tailed hawk the state raptor were on hand for a bill signing ceremony Friday, June 14, 2019, along with Scarlet, a red-tailed hawk from Auburn.


Jason Schreiber/Union Leader Correspondent


The students involved were Addie Kinnaly, Andrew Kriner, Casey Coleman, Daniel Blankenship, Grace Vander Els, Joseph O’Connor and Maia Delano.They didn’t quit despite the criticism they faced in 2015 that made national headlines when then-Rep. Warren Groen, R-Rochester, compared the red-tailed hawk hunt to an abortion at a Planned Parenthood clinic and Rep. John Burt, R-Goffstown, who complained that if bills like this continued to come before the Legislature the state would eventually be picking a “state hot dog.”The students said they learned some important lessons over the past few years.“This experience has taught us to always persevere and do our best,” Vander Els said.Kinnaly thanked the many people who stood by them during their fight.“Throughout the four-year journey there have been so many people that have supported us and we really wouldn’t be where we (are) right now if it weren’t for people like Mr. Cutting, the House members and senators that supported us, our parents and everybody else. We’re thankful and grateful for everyone and everything that’s happened during this journey,” she said.Jim Cutting, the teacher who worked with the students, congratulated them on their accomplishment.He recalled how the students were challenged when they first proposed the idea and how they learned about rejection and gained confidence.“The resurrection of the red-tailed hawk bill in December of 2018 brought new energy. With the encouragement of legislators, educators and parents, this group contemplated another red-tailed hawk exploration. They learned more about this majestic bird and supported their bill eloquently with persistence and conviction,” Cutting said.State Rep. Renny Cushing, D-Hampton, who co-sponsored the bill, recalled his first meeting with the students five years ago and how he never thought it would take so long for the students to succeed.He called the signing a “redemption moment” for the students.“From this day forward, what visitors to the New Hampshire State House are going to learn is they’re going to learn the story of the red-tailed hawk.

They can’t, on the one hand, insist that state government is in charge of “equal education opportunity” for all and therefore must pay for it, but then cry foul when the state board of education attempts to use innovation to offer more opportunities for education.Last week, the state board backed up Education Commissioner Frank Edelblut (and Gov. Chris Sununu) in endorsing a “Learn Everywhere” initiative that promises to provide true educational opportunity and credit in non-traditional settings.Under state guidelines and with state approval, public school students could earn educational credit in settings as varied as BAE engineering labs, math tutoring class at Boys and Girls Clubs, or with the FIRST Robotics teams that Dean Kamen began and that have now spread across the nation and the world.“You can’t do that,’’ is the response from the hidebound education interests. The state guidelines for “Learn Everywhere” amount to “trampling New Hampshire’s longstanding tradition of local control.”These are the same interests that don’t mind that “local control” would be trampled under by requiring that the state, not the localities, fund public education. Should that happen, do they really think the state bureaucracy is going to allow ANY deviation from a lockstep state-mandated school regimen?Rather than an outright rejection of the “Learn Everywhere” program, those truly interested in improving education for all students should be working together toward fitting education into the modern age.That would include some give and take from the state side as well. Our prediction is that none of this is likely to happen. The state board will go its way and we expect those who object to the program will go next to the legislative joint rules committee, where a Democratic majority is beholden to the teachers’ union, not to parents and children. What a shame."
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,Dave Solomon's State House Dome: Lawmakers send more than 120 bills to Sununu,"Jun 14, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/politics/statehouse_dome/dave-solomon-s-state-house-dome-lawmakers-send-more-than/article_53938391-cb54-5b7b-ae69-48902580df67.html,"Gov. Chris Sununu is about to be inundated with bills to sign, veto or allow to become law without his signature, now that the House and Senate have reconciled their differences on more than 120 pieces of legislation.











Many bills involve technical changes to existing law, the creation of study commissions or other routine business of government.But some major policy proposals have now worked their way through the legislative process, and await action by the governor as lawmakers enter the final two weeks of the current session.The House met on Thursday to vote on all House bills that were passed with amendments in the Senate, and in most cases concurred with the Senate changes, clearing more than 50 bills. The Senate did likewise on more than 70 bills.About 30 bills they couldn’t agree on will be sent to conference committees of House and Senate members next week, where a deal will be struck or the bills will die.Sununu is expected to veto many of the bills coming out of the Democratically controlled Legislature, particularly those having to do with gun control and election law.Two bills likely to be vetoed are HB 109, requiring background checks for all commercial firearms transfers, and HB 480, which imposes a waiting period between the purchase and delivery of a firearm. The House agreed to the Senate changes in those bills, and they are headed for the governor.The third high-profile gun-related bill of the session is still in dispute between the two chambers. HB 564 would allow school boards to declare gun-free zones on school property, a prerogative now preserved exclusively for the state Legislature.The House didn’t want to concur with a Senate amendment that requires at least one public hearing before such a policy is adopted, so the matter heads to a conference committee scheduled for Wednesday.The Senate agreed to House changes in a bill that extends the state’s anti-discrimination protections to school children in public schools, SB 263.The House amendment adds that the attorney general is empowered to initiate civil action against a school or school district in Superior Court or before the state Human Rights Commission.The Senate also agreed to House changes on a bill requiring menstrual hygiene products in school restrooms, SB 142.The House modified some word choices, like changing “Feminine Hygiene Products” to “Menstrual Hygiene Products,” and added that “a school district may seek grants or partner with a non-profit or community-based organization to fulfill this obligation.”Biomass battleOne bill Sununu is almost certain to veto is HB 183, which started out as an innocuous measure establishing a committee to study micro-grids for the distribution of electricity in parts of the state, but was amended by the Senate to add an unrelated provision to protect the state’s wood-fired power plants.The Legislature passed a bill last year to require the state’s largest utility to buy electricity from the six wood-fired plants at higher than wholesale prices in order to keep them operating in the interest of fuel diversity and to help sustain the state’s forestry industry.Sununu said the impact on rates for electricity consumers was unfair, and vetoed the bill. The House and Senate overrode his veto, but opponents of the bill petitioned to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to block the legislation anyway.Sen. Jeb Bradley, a big proponent of the biomass subsidy, helped develop the amendment to HB 183 in the hope that it would neutralize the argument opponents are using at FERC by changing the way the energy from the biomass power plants is classified.Even if the House and Senate can override Sununu on the biomass subsidy again this year, there’s no guarantee HB 183 will mean the end of delays that have already caused the six plants to cease operations.The FERC action was filed by the New England Ratepayers Association, and director Marc Brown says that action will continue, whether or not HB 183 becomes law.“From our counsel’s point of view, we are not willing to concede that (HB 183) avoids all the problems that (the biomass subsidy) creates,” he said.Other bills that the House and Senate have agreed to send to the governor include HB 364, allowing qualifying patients and caregivers to cultivate cannabis for therapeutic use, and HB 399, allowing for the annulment of arrests or convictions for possession of small quantities of marijuana.Both chambers have also agreed on a bill to allow transgendered individuals to obtain a new birth certificate that reflects a sex designation other than the one assigned at birth.dsolomon@unionleader.com"

ChrisSununu has pledged to keep us free of an income or sales tax. But does he realize broadbased taxes would be needed if commuter rail is installed? He needs to VETO SB 241 to stop that boondoggle in its tracks.Also, what is he doing about SB 306 that is conveniently hidden in the budget? It’s a provision to set up a 3-person (appointed, unelected and unaccountable) state “appeals board” that would allow developers to run roughshod over your town meeting votes and subsequent board decisions, per those votes. This includes ANY board, including the Historic District Commissions and Conservation Commissions in your respective towns. Developers would have the upper hand, taxpayers be damned.Does Sununu really want that egregious abuse of power and theft of local control as part of his legacy?Come on NH, this affects us all.

Their budget plans seem specifically designed to provoke a confrontation with Gov. Chris Sununu, a Republican. Perhaps they see that as their best shot at unseating him next year.But in light of Sununu’s expressed wilingness to compromise, it is the Democrats who are going to look bad, at least to New Hampshire taxpayers.Despite claims of compromise from Lou “the Lionhearted” D’Allesandro, (he was sure that he could work up a budget deal satisfactory to all parties), that’s not exactly how it has gone down.D’Allesandro and company are, for example, insisting that New Hampshire go back on its word to business by repealing tax changes, some of which have already gone into effect. That’s a great way to instill confidence. And it’s a heck of a way to promise that the Democrats are willing to compromise.A further indication of what they mean by “bipartisan” was shown when House Democrats declined to name a single Republican to the budget conference committee.On Wednesday, Gov. Sununu made it clear that he is still willing to compromise. In fact, his promise to increase spending to make it more in line with the Democrats is a little too much for our money.If the Democrats again reject Sununu, he will have every right to veto their budget. New Hampshire taxpayers need to be prepared to back him up."
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,Jenness State Beach bathhouse open in time for summer,"Jun 13, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/nh/outdoors/jenness-state-beach-bathhouse-open-in-time-for-summer/article_48c4fc5e-5d4e-5241-9625-eb9051cfb49e.html,"RYE — A new $1.2 million bathhouse at Jenness State Beach opened just in time for the busy summer season and is expected to improve the experience for visitors much like the state’s revitalization of Hampton Beach State Park eight years ago.A ribbon-cutting ceremony will be held Friday to celebrate the bathhouse, which officially opened on May 24 to replace one built in 1980.The bathhouse is open from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. each day until Labor Day and offers more amenities with changing rooms, a rinse-off shower and a family bathroom.The building’s design is similar to the facilities at Hampton Beach State Park and North Hampton State Beach.Jenness State Beach, which is located at 2280 Ocean Blvd., is one of five state park beaches along New Hampshire’s coastline.Work on the new bathhouse began in November and was completed on time and on budget, according to Brent Wucher, public information and marketing officer for the state Department of Parks and Recreation.To fund the project, the state took $1 million from the capital budget and another $200,000 from Parks and Recreation funds, Wucher said.“This is a great example of how strategic investments from the capital budget complement our operationally self-funded park system. Improving our facilities enhances visitor experiences which directly correlates to the success of our outdoor recreation economy,” said Sarah Stewart, commissioner of the Department of Natural and Cultural Resources.The new bathhouse follows the state’s $14.5 million redevelopment project down Route 1-A at Hampton Beach. That work included a major facelift with a new Seashell stage and bathhouses.John Nyhan, president of the Hampton Area Chamber of Commerce, applauded the state’s effort to keep the architectural design similar at the state’s beaches.“I’m very supportive of this type of capital improvement by the state parks and the state of New Hampshire,” Nyhan said.Since the revitalization along Hampton Beach, Nyhan said private property owners have invested more than $140 million in improvements along the west side of Ocean Boulevard and other side streets.“That’s not counting all of the town improvements, from the sewerage to the new fire station and other new infrastructure. It’s a significant amount of improvement, a lot of which benefits the town and a lot of which benefits the state of New Hampshire through meals and rooms taxes,” he said.While it’s been several years since the work was completed at Hampton Beach, Nyhan said he still hears visitors commenting on the improvements. He said he recently spoke with someone from North Conway who visited for the first time since the project and spoke about how much she liked the improved facilities and the cleanliness of the bathrooms.Ryan McGill, owner of Summer Sessions Surf Shop, which sits across the street from Jenness State Beach, was happy with the renovations.“We appreciate Gov. Chris Sununu listening to local residents to make some needed changes. It looks good,” he said.RockinghamNews@unionleader.com"
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,Controversial 'Learn Everywhere' program clears state Board of Education,"Jun 13, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/politics/state/controversial-learn-everywhere-program-clears-state-board-of-education/article_635363da-31c4-5ade-8a92-343038ea06ca.html,"CONCORD — The state Board of Education on Thursday approved the “Learn Everywhere” initiative proposed by Education Commissioner Frank Edelblut to expand opportunities for high school graduation credit outside the traditional classroom.The close 4-3 vote in favor of draft rules to implement the program reflected the divisions that marked a two-year debate among various stakeholders.Supporters of the initiative, including Gov. Chris Sununu and the state’s Business and Industry Association, say it will bring statewide consistency to what is now a hodgepodge of extended learning opportunities with wide variation from district to district.Opponents, including public school teachers and administrators, argued that local school districts should not be required to accept credit for high school graduation based on directives from the state Board of Education.Under the proposed rules, for-profit and non-profit organizations wishing to offer credit under Learn Everywhere must apply to the state Board of Education, which would review the educational programs and maintain oversight.All schools would be required to allow students to earn up to one-third of their graduation credits through the Learn Everywhere program. Schools would be allowed, but not required, to issue high school diplomas to students who earned all their credits through the Learn Everywhere program.That means a school district at its discretion could issue a high school diploma to a student who never took classes at the local high school and was educated in programs over which the local school district had no control.Called an ‘insult’Megan Tuttle, president of the state’s largest teachers’ union, NEA-NH, described the vote as “insulting to education professionals across New Hampshire.”“The Board of Education voted to no longer require state certification, student teaching, adherence to the state’s code of conduct or probationary periods to teach a high school class for a semester and award graduation credit,” she said.“They instead will now rely solely on a vendor’s application describing their ‘demonstrated qualifications’ to grant them access to students and the ability to award credit that will appear on official student transcripts even if the standards set by the local school district have not been met.”The program is also opposed by the state Association of Special Education Administrators; the School Boards Association; the School Administrators Association; and the Association of School Principals.In addition to the BIA, supporters include many of the organizations whose educational programs could become eligible for high school graduation credit, including the Boys and Girls Club, FIRST Robotics, New England College, the McAuliffe-Shepard Discovery Center and the Aviation Museum of New Hampshire.The program operators like the idea of one-stop shopping for statewide approval by the Board of Education, rather than trying to get approval for credit from more than 165 separate school districts.Dueling legislationThe state Legislature with Republican majorities passed a bill in 2018 setting the stage for the program. SB 435 ordered the Board of Education to adopt rules for approving alternative programs for credits leading to graduation. The bill appeared non-controversial at the time, and passed both House and Senate on voice votes.But as the rules were being developed, critics in the public education community complained that Edelblut was exceeding the authority granted in SB 435. The Democratic majority in the legislature this year passed another bill, SB 140, which requires approval by local school districts of credit-worthy programs.SB 140 passed on a voice vote in the Senate, and cleared the House on May 23, in a party-line 224-146 vote, with only two Republicans in favor. The bill is now on Sununu’s desk, where a veto is likely from a governor committed to alternatives to public education or “school choice” programs.“Learn Everywhere offers New Hampshire students a 21st Century educational system that extends well beyond the four walls of a classroom,” Sununu said.“This program opens up a myriad of opportunities for students in New Hampshire to pursue educational paths that encourage their passion to learn and best fit their needs.”The draft rules will now be sent to the Joint Legislative Committee on Administrative Rules, where opponents are expected to argue against approval.dsolomon@unionleader.com"

Chris Sununu last Friday, appropriates $3 million to increase the rates paid by the state on behalf of patients in the expanded Medicaid program, many of whom are struggling with addiction or mental health issues.It also appropriates $450,000 in emergency funding to support Manchester shelters that serve people in recovery from addiction.“Raising Medicaid rates for mental health providers is the number-one recommendation in the 10-year Mental Health Plan,” said Sen. Cindy Rosenwald, D-Nashua, in urging senators to override Sununu.Although the bill initially passed the Senate 23-0 in February, Republicans stood behind Sununu in a 14-10 party line vote that failed to reach the two-thirds, 16-vote requirement for a veto override.In his veto message, Sununu said the bill might have made sense in January, but the budget deadline is now just two weeks away. He expressed a preference for including such spending initiatives in the state budget, and not as separate legislative bills.The bill originally intended for the money to be appropriated in the first half of 2019, but did not reach Sununu’s desk until June 1.Sen. Jeb Bradley, R-Wolfeboro, who cosponsored the bill with Rosenwald, said he was at first surprised by Sununu’s veto, but could understand the logic.“I was caught a little off guard when I learned about the veto late last week,” he said. “But I agree with the governor that the $3 million would have made more sense if SB 5 had been enacted right away.”Bradley said the Senate acted “judiciously” in passing the bill in February, “but it seemed to take forever to come out of the House.” The bill cleared the House on May 8 with only one Republican vote.Rosenwald said waiting for the budget to be settled denies providers, now accepting some of the lowest Medicaid rates in the country, immediate rate increases that are needed to keep the doors open.“The funding, appropriated from this year’s surplus, would go to providers immediately, rather than months after a budget is signed,” she said.The bill was amended to allow any unspent funds from the $3 million to be carried over into the next fiscal year. “Because the funds are non-lapsing, they will help sustain our treatment providers beginning right now and for months to come,” said Rosenwald.The bill also included $450,000 for emergency housing programs in Manchester to support people in recovery from addiction.“These programs, which have long been funded in our state budget, have seen an increase in need so great that they are going to run out of money and become unavailable before the end of this fiscal year,” said Rosenwald.The fiscal year ends on June 30.“Today Republicans chose to protect their governor instead of the people of New Hampshire,” said Rosenwald. “While SB 5 originally passed the Senate unanimously, I am disappointed that today my Senate Republican colleagues put politics before people with their failure to override the governor’s veto.”Bradley said what really matters is that everyone, including the governor, agrees that Medicaid rates should be raised, and they will be addressed in budget negotiations. The Senate-passed version of the budget includes $52 million for Medicaid provider rate increases over the two years.“I see what the governor is trying to achieve,” he said, “and he’s basically saying ‘Roll up your sleeves, let’s work together and figure out how to get this done in a way that works for everyone.’”After the vote, Sununu said raising Medicaid provider rates is a priority he shares with the Legislature.“Now we can address this together in a fair, collaborative and fiscally responsible way through the normal budgetary route,” he said. “I look forward to working with the Legislature to get this done.”dsolomon@unionleader.com"

Chris Sununu and Department of Education Commissioner Frank Edelblut not be allowed to withdraw from the lawsuit.Ruoff already sided with the districts in a ruling issued last week, in which he found the state is violating the constitution in failing to provide adequate funding for an education. Ruoff declined to order that specific monies be awarded, ruling that any solution most come from the Legislature.“(The funding formula is) not only unsupported by the legislative record but [is] clearly or demonstratively inadequate according to the Legislature’s own definition of an adequate education,” Ruoff ruled.The districts are seeking to have the state education grants increase from $3,636 per pupil to about $10,000 per pupil. That increase reflects the true cost of educating children in these districts, according to the lawsuit. ConVal’s per-pupil cost is around $18,000.In his motion, Tierney writes that ConVal spends more than $900 per pupil each year on transportation costs alone. Winchester spends about $960, Monadnock more than $1,000, and Mascenic more than $600.The state had argued that transportation costs are not part of an adequate education, and should not be included in the funding. Tierney, however, noted that the state funding formula actually includes money for transportation, though at a much lower rate than is actually spent by districts."

Chris Sununu’s veto of legislation to boost Medicaid rates paid to providers of mental health and substance abuse services.Senate Bill 5, vetoed by Sununu last Friday, appropriates $3 million to increase the rates paid by the state on behalf of patients in the expanded Medicaid program.The bill originally intended for the money to be appropriated in the first half of 2019, but it did not clear both House and Senate until May 31.Sununu cited that timing in his June 7 veto message.“Passing this bill might have made sense in January, but we are now less than 30 days away from its end date. Given that a new state budget will be in place soon, this bill is now redundant,” he wrote.He also expressed a preference for including such spending initiatives in the state budget, and not as separate legislative bills.“Rather than passing a collection of independent spending bills at random, we collect everything into the budget because it allows us to appropriately set priorities and ensure that we are living within our means,” he said. “We have identified the funding in this bill as a policy worthy of consideration and therefore it will be discussed as a part of the budget process.”Supporters of the measure, which had broad bipartisan support in both House and Senate, point out that the funds in the bill are “non-lapsing,” meaning if not spent by June 30, they carry over into the next fiscal year.Mental health and addiction care providers were hoping for the increase to set a new baseline for rates as a long-term solution is debated in the budget negotiations about to get under way.Also, if the budget is vetoed and the state agencies have to operate at current funding levels until the impasse is resolved, money for higher Medicaid rates will have already been approved if SB 5 becomes law.The bill also authorizes $450,000 in general funds for emergency shelter for people in recovery from addiction.Medicaid rates have not been increased across the board since 2006.“New Hampshire has one of the worst opioid epidemics with one of the worst treatment provider capacities. SB 5 bolsters behavioral health rates for our providers consistent with our bipartisan Medicaid expansion agreement,” said Senate Majority Leader Dan Feltes, D-Concord, in reaction to the governor’s veto.“The governor’s veto is frankly shocking and dangerous for continued access to mental health and substance use disorder treatment in the future.”The bill passed the Senate in February, 23-0, and cleared the House on May 8, 207-130, with only one Republican vote. The Senate might have the votes to override Sununu’s veto, but it’s unlikely that the House will.SB 5 was intended as a stopgap measure, as the Legislature and governor negotiate over the best way to address Medicaid rates on a long-term basis. The Senate budget increases rates across all providers by 3% in each year of the next bienium, starting on July 1.Sununu and his commissioner of Health and Human Services oppose an across-the-board increase in favor of rate-setting based on an actuarial analysis that could result in different rate increases for different providers or services.“The flat percentage increase methodology used in the Senate’s (budget) to increase rates would not ensure an equitable allocation to Medicaid providers, as it does not take into consideration rate increases proposed elsewhere in the budget or in other legislation,” according to Meyers.dsolomon@unionleader.com"

Cory Booker remains mired in the pack of 2020 Democratic candidates.But his political organization, especially in the early voting states, is getting some national notice and Booker believes this will make all the difference.""The reality is right now the polling does not give any kind of good indication of where this nomination is going to go. The metrics I'm focusing on right now is how we are distinguishing ourselves on the ground with organization, endorsements and the like and I'm pretty excited about where we are here,"" Booker said during a telephone interview Wednesday.""Sure we are still battling name recognition compared to Joe (Biden), Bernie (Sanders) and some others but there's still plenty of time for that to change and I'm convinced that it will.""During the midterm elections in 2018, no one raised more money and helped more New Hampshire Democrats on the ballot than Booker did.He has to hope those investments will pay dividends.""We feel very confident about our strategy; our early primary states are going to give us tremendous momentum. I think we are outpacing our competition and people are telling me we are doing this the right way, running the kind of campaign that has won in the past and can win in the future,"" Booker said.Like Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., Booker has tried to build broader support through policy plans. That includes expanding the earned income tax credit, offering investment accounts for children, a renter's credit to make housing more affordable and a gun-violence prevention plan that is among the most ambitious of all his primary rivals.Booker continues to believe the path to this nomination is not to offer the greatest anti-Trump rant, but an agenda that inspires voters.""He wants this election to be all about him. He wants to be the sole focus of American attention and continue to divide this country and we can't allow that,"" Booker said. ""For us to prevail, this race has to be about what we are for.""Harris wins convert with plan for dreamers2020 Democratic hopeful Kamala Harris won over a prominent New Hampshire supporter with her ambitious plan to deploy as President executive action to prevent immigrants from being deported.The California senator has used this approach before; her plans on equal pay and reproductive rights would include going over the heads of Congress while she's waiting for Capitol Hill to get its act together.Harris would direct Homeland Security to retroactively grant work authorization for dreamers and formally admit them into the U.S. by using the model that now exists for victims of natural disaster or families of U.S. service members.""As a first-generation immigrant and the first Indian American to be elected to the New Hampshire State Legislature, I deeply understand the value of taking bold action to ensure dreamers have a pathway to citizenship,"" said state Rep. Latha Mangipudi, D-Nashua, who has yet to endorse a candidate.""Senator Harris' proposal to create a pathway to citizenship for dreamers is smart and critical. With hundreds of dreamers in New Hampshire facing the threat of deportation, the time for action is now. I'm proud that Harris has put out this proposal.""The Harris campaign estimates their policies would help 3,400 in the Deferred Action for Parents of children born legally here and another 400 children in the dreamers category in NH.""These young people are just as American as I am, and they deserve a President who will fight for them from day one,"" Harris said.Sununu holds clear edge in 2020 fundraisingThe two new Democratic figures looking to take on Gov. Chris Sununu next year, Senate Majority Leader Dan Feltes and Executive Councilor Andru Volinsky, both D-Concord, did well with money coming into their political action committee coffers during 2019.But a look inside the numbers reveals the two-term Republican incumbent Sununu did have a decided edge.On its face, Sununu raised $220,641, just about the amount he did during the same period in 2017.Feltes raised $114,670. Volinsky did slightly better with $128,034.But both Feltes and Volinsky had large surpluses left over from their 2018 reelection campaigns, which they won with ease.Feltes moved $16,189 from his 2018 state Senate account; Volinsky transferred even more. He had $45,302 left over after winning a second council term over Republican James Beard.Prominent supporters of Sununu early on include car dealer Andy Crews ($1,000); former Bush White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card of Jaffrey ($1,000); ex-U.S. Rep. Charles Bass ($1,000); Eversource PAC ($1,000); 2014 GOP nominee for Governor Walt Havenstein of Westlake, Tex. ($1,000); Nextra Energy ($1,000), San Francisco engineer Albert Tanner ($7,000); lawyer Philip Taub ($5,000) and developer John Flatley ($1,000).As lawyers both Feltes and Volinsky had many members of the New Hampshire bar on their side and there was some overlap.James Rosenberg with the Shaheen and Gordon firm gave Feltes $5,000 while principal Steve Gordon gave Volinsky $500.Stonyfield Yogurt co-founder Gary Hirshberg gave Feltes $1,000 as did the N.H. Realtors, sheet metal workers union, Concord lawyer Chris Sullivan and former Executive Council Democratic nominee Dan Weeks of Nashua.Manchester developer Dick Anagnost gave Volinsky $5,000 and Geoffrey Clark, the husband of Sen.

""This plan would enact equal protections for LGBTQ Americans, undo the damage of the last two years, and make the United States a global leader on LGBTQ rights.""Emmett Soldati, another LGBTQ small business owner of Teatotaller in Somersorth, said O'Rourke pledged to protect these residents when he visited Soldati's business last April.""Granite Staters take their liberties and freedoms seriously -- and that includes freedom for all Americans,"" Soldati said.""Beto's plan gets our country back on track with the priorities our state cares about and will begin to undo the harms already caused by this Administration’s agenda.""Elbows flying in ""shadow"" Senate primaryThere are three actively exploring a GOP run for the U.S. Senate in 2020, former House Speaker Bill O'Brien, retired Brig.

Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,Kevin Landrigan's Granite Status: Booker thinks he has winning formula,"Jun 12, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/politics/granite_status/kevin-landrigan-s-granite-status-booker-thinks-he-has-winning/article_cfa0aa07-f6d3-5e88-9a6d-e14f1c96ea56.html,"According to the polls and campaign finance at the national level, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker remains mired in the pack of 2020 Democratic candidates.But his political organization, especially in the early voting states, is getting some national notice and Booker believes this will make all the difference.“The reality is right now the polling does not give any kind of good indication of where this nomination is going to go. The metrics I’m focusing on right now is how we are distinguishing ourselves on the ground with organization, endorsements and the like and I’m pretty excited about where we are here,” Booker said during a telephone interview Wednesday.“Sure we are still battling name recognition compared to Joe (Biden), Bernie (Sanders) and some others but there’s still plenty of time for that to change and I’m convinced that it will.”During the midterm elections in 2018, no one raised more money and helped more New Hampshire Democrats on the ballot than Booker did.He has to hope those investments will pay dividends.“We feel very confident about our strategy; our early primary states are going to give us tremendous momentum. I think we are outpacing our competition and people are telling me we are doing this the right way, running the kind of campaign that has won in the past and can win in the future,” Booker said.Like Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., Booker has tried to build broader support through policy plans. That includes expanding the earned income tax credit, offering investment accounts for children, a renter’s credit to make housing more affordable and a gun-violence prevention plan that is among the most ambitious of all his primary rivals.Booker continues to believe the path to this nomination is not to offer the greatest anti-Trump rant, but an agenda that inspires voters.“He wants this election to be all about him. He wants to be the sole focus of American attention and continue to divide this country and we can’t allow that,” Booker said. “For us to prevail, this race has to be about what we are for.”Harris wins convert with plan for dreamers2020 Democratic hopeful Kamala Harris won over a prominent New Hampshire supporter with her ambitious plan to deploy as President executive action to prevent immigrants from being deported.The California senator has used this approach before; her plans on equal pay and reproductive rights would include going over the heads of Congress while she’s waiting for Capitol Hill to get its act together.Harris would direct Homeland Security to retroactively grant work authorization for dreamers and formally admit them into the U.S. by using the model that now exists for victims of natural disaster or families of U.S. service members.“As a first-generation immigrant and the first Indian American to be elected to the New Hampshire State Legislature, I deeply understand the value of taking bold action to ensure dreamers have a pathway to citizenship,” said state Rep. Latha Mangipudi, D-Nashua, who has yet to endorse a candidate.“Senator Harris’ proposal to create a pathway to citizenship for dreamers is smart and critical. With hundreds of dreamers in New Hampshire facing the threat of deportation, the time for action is now. I’m proud that Harris has put out this proposal.”The Harris campaign estimates their policies would help 3,400 in the Deferred Action for Parents of children born legally here and another 400 children in the dreamers category in NH.“These young people are just as American as I am, and they deserve a President who will fight for them from day one,” Harris said.Sununu holds clear edge in 2020 fundraisingThe two new Democratic figures looking to take on Gov. Chris Sununu next year, Senate Majority Leader Dan Feltes and Executive Councilor Andru Volinsky, both D-Concord, did well with money coming into their political action committee coffers during 2019.But a look inside the numbers reveals the two-term Republican incumbent Sununu did have a decided edge.On its face, Sununu raised $220,641, just about the amount he did during the same period in 2017.Feltes raised $114,670. Volinsky did slightly better with $128,034.But both Feltes and Volinsky had large surpluses left over from their 2018 reelection campaigns, which they won with ease.Feltes moved $16,189 from his 2018 state Senate account; Volinsky transferred even more. He had $45,302 left over after winning a second council term over Republican James Beard.Prominent supporters of Sununu early on include car dealer Andy Crews ($1,000); former Bush White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card of Jaffrey ($1,000); ex-U.S. Rep. Charles Bass ($1,000); Eversource PAC ($1,000); 2014 GOP nominee for Governor Walt Havenstein of Westlake, Tex. ($1,000); Nextra Energy ($1,000), San Francisco engineer Albert Tanner ($7,000); lawyer Philip Taub ($5,000) and developer John Flatley ($1,000).As lawyers both Feltes and Volinsky had many members of the New Hampshire bar on their side and there was some overlap.James Rosenberg with the Shaheen and Gordon firm gave Feltes $5,000 while principal Steve Gordon gave Volinsky $500.Stonyfield Yogurt co-founder Gary Hirshberg gave Feltes $1,000 as did the N.H. Realtors, sheet metal workers union, Concord lawyer Chris Sullivan and former Executive Council Democratic nominee Dan Weeks of Nashua.Manchester developer Dick Anagnost gave Volinsky $5,000 and Geoffrey Clark, the husband of Sen.

Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,Sununu outlines 'Roadmap to Common Ground' on state budget,"Jun 12, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/politics/state/sununu-outlines-roadmap-to-common-ground-on-state-budget/article_9e8485de-17d5-5227-b1b4-69078e3ff03c.html,"CONCORD — Republican Gov. Chris Sununu laid out his vision for a budget compromise with the Democratically controlled Legislature that does not include some of their biggest policy objectives on paid family leave, business taxes and education funding.


            Budget debate reflects conflicting visions for state's futureAt a Wednesday morning briefing on his “Roadmap to Common Ground,” Sununu outlined several areas in which he suggested possible compromise, but he also drew some lines in the sand.He said he could not sign a budget containing the paid family medical leave plan that has cleared both House and Senate with 0.5% payroll withholding. The governor calls that an income tax.He pledged to veto any budget with the tax on capital gains to fund education that passed the House, but was not included in the Senate budget.The governor also said he could not sign a budget with the elimination of business tax cuts scheduled for tax years 2019 and 2021.When asked if the freeze on business tax cuts would be in the budget handed to Sununu, despite his veto threat, Senate Finance Chair Lou D’Allesandro said, “Absolutely.”“You cannot construct a budget without the freezing of the business taxes,” said the Manchester Democrat. “I think it’s an area there will be a lot of discussion on.”According to existing law, the Business Profits Tax (BPT) went from 7.9% to 7.7% on Jan. 1, 2019, while the Business Enterprise Tax (BET) — essentially a payroll tax — went from 0.675% to 0.60%.Democrats would rescind those reductions, even though some businesses have already made quarterly tax payments based on the 2019 rates.On Jan. 1, 2021, the BPT is scheduled to go down to 7.5% and the BET to 0.05% — cuts that would not take place according to House and Senate budgets.Rollback debatedD’Allesandro said the rollback of the tax cuts adds $100 million over the two fiscal years, which is needed to balance the legislative versions of the budget.Senate Majority Leader Dan Feltes, D-Concord, said business taxes at 2018 levels are already the lowest in New England.“Threatening to veto an entire state budget because of his opposition to paid family leave or opposition to freezing business taxes, when we have the lowest business taxes in New England, is financially irresponsible and holds New Hampshire back from making progress on issues critical to small businesses and working families,” he said.In a letter to Senate President Donna Soucy, D-Manchester, and House Speaker Steve Shurtleff, D-Concord, Sununu reiterated his aversion to tinkering with the tax cuts, which he said have contributed to the state’s booming economy and record high tax receipts.“We should not sacrifice this success by reversing course and raising tax rates,” he wrote. “All told, we are expecting almost $190 million more in revenue in fiscal year 2021 than we are receiving now. We do not have a revenue problem and there is no need to raise business tax rates.”Rather than approve the Legislature’s plan for paid family medical leave funded through a 0.5% payroll deduction, Sununu said he would push for his voluntary plan that would start with state-funded family medical leave for the state’s 10,000 employees.Medicaid ratesWhile standing firm against some of the biggest tax and policy initiatives in the legislative budgets, Sununu said he was willing to compromise in several areas, including Medicaid provider rates.The Senate budget includes $52 million for rate increases, while Sununu initially proposed $0. His “common ground” compromise calls for $30 million.The governor also seems willing to give up the idea of dispensing $52 million in surplus funds for targeted municipal projects, in favor of a Senate proposal for $40 million in revenue-sharing for municipalities to spend as they wish.“My plan targeted towns of specific need across the state, especially those on the property-poor side,” said Sununu. “The Senate has a revenue sharing program which is a great way to do it. Not nearly as much money as I would have spent on it, but it includes more towns, so we found a lot of middle ground there.”Sununu said the parties can also find common ground on funding for the university system. “They want to increase operational dollars for the university system, and I think there’s a way we can do that, perhaps not at the level they want,” he said.Sununu proposed a new 60-bed forensic psychiatric hospital, while the Senate budget reduced that to 24 beds. The governor’s “common ground” proposal calls for 36 beds as a compromise.Stabilization grantsOne of the biggest concessions by the governor would be his willingness to go along with restoration of so-called stabilization grants to local school districts, which are designed to help keep per-pupil state funding stable, even as enrollment declines.Those grants were being phased out, and restoring them fully would cost $34 million in each year of the two-year budget, according to Senate estimates. Sununu said he would favor restoring stabilization at 90 percent.Sununu’s “common ground” proposal also includes $64 million in building aid to property-poor school districts and a $32 million student debt assistance program, neither of which are in House or Senate budgets.“I think we’ve given a lot here,” he said. “Any time you don’t get everything you want and they can say they didn’t get everything they want, but we can say we’ve had a positive impact on a lot of these programs, that’s a big win.”Despite the disagreements that remain, House Majority Leader Doug Ley, D-Jaffrey, sounded optimistic that a budget veto can be avoided.“In a negotiation no one party will get everything that they want, but I am confident we will form a compromise that will work for all parties and the people of New Hampshire,” he said.dsolomon@unionleader.com"
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,Rochester's Opportunity Zones could transform downtown area,"Jun 11, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/business/rochester-s-opportunity-zones-could-transform-downtown-area/article_954d39aa-2259-5b69-af61-b7504b297126.html,"ROCHESTER — The city of Rochester has a new economic development director, and he says the team is poised to invite investors to take advantage of two Opportunity Zones downtown.Michael Scala, who was born in Rochester and grew up in Wakefield, said he remembers when the Lilac Mall in Rochester was built decades ago and concern about a loss of businesses downtown back then.Scala said new revitalization efforts are exciting community members, and now they need developers and investors interested in partnering with the city to make downtown Rochester a destination.“Everyone is just super excited to address that and start the conversation in earnest about what we can do. And I see the Opportunity Zones as, that to me, could be the final piece,” Scala said.“On May 3, 2018, New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu nominated 27 census tracts to be designated as Opportunity Zones, a federal program encouraging economic development and investment in low income areas around the country,” according to The New Hampshire Division of Economic Development website.Other communities on the Seacoast that have designated Opportunity Zones include Dover, Durham, Seabrook and Somersworth.Scala said Rochester has a framework for what it can do. He plans to market the city to multiple potential stakeholders once the rules are finalized in New Hampshire.“It all comes down to the investors. When they finally hear what their return on investment will be, as far as what are the benefits of putting your money in for seven years versus 10 years, versus 15 years, when that all gets hammered out and the rules get written, then you’ll see the money free up,” Scala explained.The historic Rochester Fairgrounds area is included in one of the Opportunity Zones, city staff member Jenn Marsh said.“The fairgrounds is our most underutilized piece of property in the city land-wise, but there’s other buildings that have been vacant for a long time that we as a department have been kind of highlighting for these Opportunity Zones so investors know what buildings are available,” Marsh said.They include Scenic Theatre and Salinger Block buildings on North Main Street.Rochester’s Economic Development Executive Secretary Jennifer Murphy Aubin said this spring the city worked with graduate students from the University of New Hampshire’s Peter T. Paul College of Business and Economics to develop an Opportunity Zone investment prospectus for the city as part of the students’ year-end capstone project.Robb Atkinson, who earned his MBA in marketing and organizational behavior, said Friday their research showed Opportunity Zones in Rochester could be transformative for the city.Rochester has taken its two Opportunity Zones and “put them together in a unique way that covers much of the downtown area and makes it really an attractive place for investors to come and put manufacturing centers in because of the tax incentives,” Atkinson said. “There’s a huge economic upside for anyone who has the capital to do it.”"
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,Local control cited as state's 'Learn Everywhere' program goes up for vote,"Jun 11, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/education/local-control-cited-as-state-s-learn-everywhere-program-goes/article_e3a794bb-cb0e-5280-bc78-e152ceffbec3.html,"CONCORD — As the state Board of Education prepares to vote Thursday on a controversial “learn everywhere” program, the associations representing the state’s teachers, administrators, special educators, school boards and principals, along with the League of Women Voters, have all weighed in against the idea promoted by Education Commissioner Frank Edelblut and endorsed by Gov. Chris Sununu.Thursday’s vote comes after months of public hearings and debate on a plan to allow academic credit for extracurricular activities that meet the approval of the state Board of Education, while bypassing local school boards and educators.In a letter to the Board of Education released on Tuesday, the top education groups were united in their criticism of Edelblut’s proposal.“We believe that as proposed, the ‘Learn Everywhere’ rules trample local control, are highly skewed toward wealthy families, grant graduation credits from non-accredited, non-credential sources, and provide little oversight and limited protections to students with disabilities and their families,” the letter states.It’s signed by Jane Bergeron-Beaulieu, executive director of the Association of Special Education Administrators; Barrett M. Christina, executive director of the School Boards Association; Carl Ladd, executive director of the School Administrators Association; Ken Page, interim executive director, Association of School Principals; and Megan Tuttle, president of the NEA-New Hampshire teachers’ union.Instead of approving Learn Everywhere, the group of education professionals urges the board to support an existing program known as Extended Learning Opportunities.The League of Women Voters echoed that theme in their statement, pointing out that “New Hampshire’s public schools already award credit for work done outside the traditional high school program, including Extended Learning Opportunities coordinated by the local high schools.”“We urge the State Board of Education to support learning opportunities such as these rather than the ill-defined Learn Everywhere proposal.”Edelblut defendsIn a recent interview, Edelblut defended Learn Everywhere as a way of standardizing extracurricular credit opportunities across the state, using the Women in Technology internship program at BAE as an example.“I’ve got 24 young women working at BAE for 16 weeks. They come out of school at 1 p.m. and go over to BAE for a program. They have a tremendous experience, getting exposed to technology and learning all kinds of different things,” says the commissioner.“When I did an informal survey of the educators who were there, there was one school that was granting the students credit, but the majority of schools were granting no credit to the students. So it either is learning or it isn’t learning. Why is it that one school allows the student to get engineering credit working at BAE, and other schools don’t recognize that?”The problem, according to critics of the program, is that approval of credit will be out of the hands of the local school districts that are accountable for the quality of the high school diploma that is granted.Edelblut says those fears are misplaced, because the decisions will be made by equally competent educators at the state Department of Education, based on a rigorous application process.“The Office of Instructional Support at DOE would be responsible for accrediting the programs because we want to make sure the students are getting good learning opportunities as well,” says Edelblut. “And that office is staffed with individuals who have worked for decades in the New Hampshire public education system. They have the ability to evaluate a program and determine if good learning is taking place.”Local control at issueThe coalition of education officials opposing the new program calls it a violation of local control, stating that, “Learn Everywhere breaches the authority of school boards and communities to determine the qualifications for credit-bearing courses and ignores the teacher credentialing process and school accreditation procedure that the state administers, trampling New Hampshire’s longstanding tradition of local control.”Edelblut says such criticism ignores the “guardrails” that will be in place to ensure the quality of any course or activity accepted for high school credit.”They have to get approved by the state Board of Education,” he said. “The program and faculty have to be vetted. It has the right kind of guardrails. We don’t want to credential programs that are not effective for students.”According to the Department of Education, activities that could become eligible for academic credit include “an aspiring actor, dancer, or musician performing in an arts program; a student receiving after-school math tutoring at the Boys and Girls Club; or a part-time internship at a local manufacturing company that leads to acquired skills.”“Learn Everywhere offers New Hampshire students a 21st century educational system that extends well beyond the four walls of a classroom,” said Gov. Chis Sununu.“Bolstering innovative proposals such as Learn Everywhere, which recognize that a one-size fits all approach does not work for every student, is key to the success of our children. This program opens up a myriad of opportunities for students in New Hampshire to pursue educational paths that encourage their passion to learn and best fit their needs.”Vote on rulesEdelblut presented the initial rule proposal in December, followed by public hearings in February and March. The vote Thursday will be on the final rules.If the State Board approves the rules Thursday, they’ll be sent to the Joint Legislative Committee on Administrative Rules (JLCAR) for review.

Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,Littleton glad to celebrate Pollyanna Recognition Day,"Jun 9, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/human_interest/littleton-glad-to-celebrate-pollyanna-recognition-day/article_de4dcbe4-fa3d-5f18-930f-0ca2a94a5a8d.html,"LITTLETON — A new law makes the second Saturday in June “Pollyanna of Littleton New Hampshire Recognition Day.”Dozens of people of all ages gathered Saturday under blue skies and a bright sun on the lawn of the Littleton Public Library to celebrate the 17th anniversary of the unveiling of the bronze statue of Pollyanna. Pollyanna is the literary creation of Littleton author Eleanor H. Porter (1868-1920).The new law was frequently invoked at the celebration.Signed on June 6 by Gov. Chris Sununu, House Bill 572, which was sponsored by Rep. Linda Massimilla, D-Littleton, and co-sponsored by Rep. Erin Hennessey, R-Littleton, hails the Pollyanna statue “as an attraction and a welcoming symbol of the gladness and optimism of the people of New Hampshire.”It requires the governor to annually “urge schools, libraries, and citizens to commemorate the day with appropriate ceremonies and activities,” something the residents of Littleton have been doing since 2002 when the Pollyanna statute, which was commissioned by the Eames family and created by artist Emile Birch, was installed at the Littleton Public Library.Beginning in 2003 with the first Pollyanna Glad Day, the nonprofit Pollyanna of Littleton New Hampshire Inc. has marked the occasion with a ceremony that includes a brief history about Porter, proclamations from the sitting governor and the Littleton Board of Selectmen, music, and the presentation of the Pollyanna Signature Award.

The ceremony ends with a group photo in front of the Pollyanna statue, with participants making like Pollyanna — smiling broadly with their heads thrown back and arms wide open and outstretched to embrace the world.The 2019 recipient of the award was Massimilla, a Massachusetts native who has lived in Littleton for some four decades and who was a teacher in the nearby town of Lisbon for 36 years until her retirement in 2006.Currently in her fourth term as a member of the New Hampshire House of Representatives, Massimilla epitomizes the Pollyanna spirit in her optimistic attitude and her perseverance, said Karen Keazirian.Keazirian — a longtime organizer of the Pollyanna Glad Day observances and herself a Signature Award honoree — pointed out that 2019 is a significant year for Massimilla.Not only did Massimilla’s work with the “Bienvenue au New Hampshire” initiative come to fruition with the introduction of marketing materials to welcome French-speaking visitors to the Granite State, Keazirian said, but Massimilla also successfully worked to get HB572 approved by the New Hampshire House and Senate.Keazirian joked that, with the latter accomplishment, now “it’s the law to be glad.”"

The fact that New Hampshire continues to rely almost exclusively on property taxes to fund education — more than 20 years after state Supreme Court rulings in Claremont I and II found that method unconstitutional — illustrates just how intractable the problem has been.“We are simply unable to fathom a legitimate governmental purpose to justify the gross inequities in educational opportunities evident from the record,” wrote Ruoff.The town of Pittsfield has to tax its residents at a rate of $18 per thousand of assessed property value to support expenditures of $14,723 per pupil, while Rye taxes its residents at an equalized rate of $6.20 per thousand to fund $19,535 per pupil.It is wishful thinking for the state to contribute $3,636 per pupil and call that adequate funding for an adequate education, said Ruoff. “The parties agree that not a single school in the state of New Hampshire could or does function at $3,562 per student.”

According to the four school districts that filed the lawsuit, the actual cost of an education — based on Department of Education data — is approximately $18,901 per student.The school districts — Contoocook Valley, or ConVal, in Peterborough, Mascenic in Greenville, Monadnock in Swanzey, and Winchester — wanted the court to set the base adequacy amount at $9,929 per student for fiscal year 2020 and $10,843 for 2019, but the judge declined. Such a move would add $1.6 billion to the state’s $13 billion budget.












        

        
            Court says state education funding unconstitutional

Cheshire Superior Court Judge David Ruoff ruled that the state’s formula for funding education is unconstitutional, according to a 98-page decision released Wednesday.




Ruled unconstitutionalRuoff struck down the current funding formula as unconstitutional, but declined to set a new one.“Such a decision should not rest in the hands of judges,” he wrote. “However, as the Supreme Court has repeatedly warned in school-funding cases: Constitutional rights must be enforced or they cease to exist. Almost every constitutional challenge to the Legislature’s attempts to define and provide funding for an adequate education has been successful.”Gov. Chris Sununu agrees that “critical funding decisions are best left to local elected leaders — who represent the people of New Hampshire — not judges in a courtroom,” but he offered little in the way of education-funding reform in his state budget.He’s proposing some targeted school building aid and stabilization grants, the method by which the state “stabilizes” per-pupil funding even as enrollment declines.The most ambitious proposal to address education funding is contained in the House version of the state budget, with $170 million in new aid, mostly to property-poor school districts, funded by a new capital gains tax.The Senate has about $60 million in additional educational funding in its budget, along with $40 million in revenue sharing to municipalities that cities and towns might allocate to education, or might not.Nobody has a plan that even comes close to addressing Judge Ruoff’s order, nor is there any likelihood that one will be developed soon. The state’s most likely course of action will be to appeal the ruling and buy some time.Dueling budgets“The dueling (House and Senate) budgets have more or less some building blocks to respond to the Claremont principles,” said Executive Councilor Andru Volinsky, an attorney who represented property-poor school districts in the original Claremont lawsuits. “The House has more, the Senate has far less.”The most promising component of the House and Senate legislation, according to Volinsky, is the appropriation of $500,000 for an independent commission that will study the current funding formula and make recommendations to the Legislature in 2021.“We need to have careful plans to finally meet responsibilities that are more than 20 years old,” said Volinsky, a potential Democratic challenger to Sununu in the 2020 election.Study commissions on the issue are nothing new. Gov. Jeanne Shaheen convened one soon after the Claremont decisions. In the end, lawmakers settled on the statewide education property tax (SWEPT).For a while, SWEPT money collected from property-rich communities that exceeded their allocation from the state funding formula was redirected to property-poor communities, creating the “donor town” vs. “receiver town” tension that was resolved when that system was abandoned by a vote of the state Legislature in 2010.Stabilization grantsAs an alternative to help the property-poor communities, the Legislature introduced the stabilization grants, but then began to cut away at them over the years, so it comes as little surprise that both parties are back in court.Republicans over the years have proposed constitutional amendments that would remove judicial authority over school-funding decisions, in the hope of settling the matter that way.Democratic Gov. John Lynch proposed such an amendment himself, but there is little trust among many lawmakers that the Legislature would do the right thing on educational funding without court oversight.“I concur with what they’re saying in court,” says Rep. Rick Ladd, R-Haverhill, the ranking Republican on the House Education Committee and a former educator himself. “We have a legislative responsibility for this.”Meeting that mandate might require a greater sense of shared responsibility for students throughout the state, no matter what town they live in. Volinsky is optimistic that the tide might finally be shifting in that direction.He and other attorneys involved in the original Claremont lawsuits have been touring the state in the past year, conducting workshops on education funding and the need for relief to the property-poor districts.The last one will be June 19 at Kearsarge Middle School in New London starting at 6 p.m.Consensus building?“The problem of insufficient funding has impacted more and more communities,” Volinsky said. “If you think about it, back in the mid- to late-1990s, the state as a whole was green and thriving, and there were a couple of dark spots. Well, the dark spots have grown, and the thriving areas have shrunk.”“We have done 35 forums around the state, and I can assure you that the consensus is building. There is recognition on two levels — one is in terms of understanding the social compact … that we are responsible for one another … and also on the level of enlightened self-interest, because the wealthy communities require educated workforces, and the way in which we fund schools makes it harder to produce well-educated, well-trained participants in the economy.”Ladd agrees that “maybe conditions have changed,” but predicts that any effort to raise the kind of money needed for the state to truly fund an adequate education will be met with stiff opposition.For now, everyone is just awaiting the next step in the legal process.New Hampshire Center for Public Policy Studies Director Doug Hall, who has participated with Volinsky in the New Hampshire School Funding Fairness Project, says Ruoff was anticipating that next step in his ruling: “He has put everything together so the justices on the Supreme Court will have a ready reference and won’t accidentally miss an important point when this case gets to them.”dsolomon@unionleader.com"
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,Dave Solomon's State House Dome: Interim chief named at DOJ,"Jun 8, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/politics/statehouse_dome/dave-solomon-s-state-house-dome-interim-chief-named-at/article_deda3bae-6985-5f37-b5b6-5861f2cb7e45.html,"DEPUTY Attorney General Jane Young is now running day-to-day operations at the Department of Justice, in the wake of Attorney General Gordon MacDonald’s nomination to the state Supreme Court.













Deputy Attorney General Jane Young


Gov. Chris Sununu last week nominated MacDonald to replace Chief Justice Robert Lynn, who’s reaching the mandatory retirement age of 70.“I believe it is in the best interest of this office as well as the people and institutions we serve for me to delegate temporarily my duties as Attorney General to you while the nomination is pending,” MacDonald wrote in a June 6 letter to Young released by the DOJ on Friday.MacDonald is already involved in several cases as Attorney General that could come before the Supreme Court. If confirmed as chief justice, he could have to recuse himself from those cases.The New Hampshire Campaign for Voting Rights has already weighed in on one such case, the lawsuit by the state Democratic Party and other plaintiffs against the state over a 2018 election law known as Senate Bill 3.











MacDonald is named in the ongoing court case over SB 3, which established a new voter verification process for those trying to register within 30 days of an election.A Superior Court judge struck down the bill in October of 2018, describing it as an unconstitutional burden on the right to vote. The case was appealed to the state Supreme Court and is likely to come to trial in late summer.“As a coalition dedicated to protecting the right to vote of every eligible Granite Stater, we have reason for concern regarding Attorney General MacDonald’s nomination to the state’s highest court,” according to Kate Corriveau, New Hampshire state director for America Votes.“Given his role in the ongoing litigation surrounding SB 3, legislation that overly burdens certain groups to exercise their right to vote, we expect that, should he be confirmed, he will recuse himself from the case as it heads to trial later this year.”The litigation that MacDonald has launched against the chemical companies that manufacture PFAS chemicals could also end up before the state Supreme Court. Two lawsuits have been filed in Hillsborough County Superior Court North.MacDonald has declined interviews prior to the public hearing on his appointment. A date for that hearing is expected to be announced next week.Meanwhile, Executive Councilor Andru Volinsky has written to both Sununu and attorney Chuck Douglas, chairman of the Governor’s Judicial Selection Commission, with questions about the process that led to MacDonald’s nomination.He asks when the position was first posted on the Selection Commission’s website, how many applications were received and reviewed, and how many interviews were conducted by a quorum of the commission and when.“I think we have a responsibility to the people of the state for this to be an open and fair process,” said Volinsky.If MacDonald is confirmed, he will be the third judge on the five-member state Supreme Court chosen by Sununu, joining Anna Barbara “Bobbie” Hantz Marconi and Patrick E. Donovan, none of whom have previous experience as a judge at a lower court.MacDonald was an attorney with the firm Nixon Peabody prior to his nomination as Attorney General; Hantz Marconi was with the firm Sheehan, Phinney, Bass & Green, while Donovan was in private practice in Salem..Sununu signed 24 bills into law last week, including two important measures in support of the Division for Children, Youth and Families that had become somewhat of a political football — Senate Bill 6, regarding child protection staffing, and Senate Bill 14, regarding child protection policies.“Together, SB 6 and SB 14 represent the biggest step forward our state has made in a generation for the wellbeing of New Hampshire’s children,” said Senate President Donna Soucy, D-Manchester.Democrats were holding on to the bill in the hope of working with Sununu to stage a ceremonial signing with chief sponsor Sen. Jon Morgan in his Seacoast-area district, but that was not to be. The bill was released by Soucy’s office around 11:30 a.m. on Monday and by 2 p.m. Sununu was signing it into law.dsolomon@unionleader.com"

            Nix the housing board: Issue shouldn't be in state budgetGov. Chris Sununu fashioned a none-too-lean budget of $12.686 billion for the next two years, coming from the state general fund, education trust fund, and other state and federal funding sources.That isn’t nearly enough for the Democrats running the Legislature this year. It is millions less than either the House or Senate versions, which weigh in at $13 billion.Business tax cuts already on the books would be taken away by the Democrats. Under the guise of “family leave,’’ they would give us our first income tax.And a second promise to limit expanded Medicaid spending would also be ripped asunder.Perhaps they realize that passing such a beauty will lead to their party’s defeat in 2020, so they are striking while they can. Gov. Sununu is going to need all the public support he can get to stop this disaster."

Chris Sununu said Motorcycle Week has become a source of pride in New Hampshire and is a boon to the economy.“Don’t take it for granted. A lot of pieces have to come together to make it all happen standing on decades of success.”Many of those responsible for helping to lay the foundation for the event’s progress were on hand.Laconia Mayor Ed Engler presiding over his sixth and last Bike Week as a city leader, offered his thanks to the many people “who have kept the rally alive and thriving.” The addition of the flat track will give race fans a new reason to enjoy the thrill of racing in Loudon, he said.This is the 96th Annual Laconia Motorcycle Rally and Race Week. It’s the oldest motorcycle rally in America, with roots stretching back to the summer of 1916, when a so-called “Gypsy Tour” gathered for several days at Weirs Beach on the shore of Lake Winnipesaukee.The ride got its name because those early riders would travel long distances, often sleeping in tents along the way much like the Hollywood stereotypes of the nomadic Gypsies. Organized for riders to gather and enjoy other related activities including racing and hill climbing, the event continues that tradition today, although for the most part tents have been replaced by hotel rooms.Jennifer Anderson of the Laconia Motorcycle Week Association says the event is not just about the races, shows, live music and parades of bikes as far as the eye can see. The rally part centers around riding, and much of that activity is organized for the benefit of local charities.The 13th Annual Peter Makris Memorial Run on Saturday honors the life of a community leader and patriarch of the NASWA Resort. It has raised more than $430,000 since its inception to benefit the Laconia Fire Department’s Water Rescue Team, Easter Seals NH and the Veterans Count program among others.Those who enjoy the allure of the open road and the wind in their faces make the annual pilgrimage to meet other like-minded folks and to take in all that the spectacle offers, including demo rides, vendor displays, live music, bike shows, swap meets, tattoo contests, on-track racing, stunt shows and hill climbs.Although Weirs Beach remains the epicenter of Bike Week, the state Department of Travel and Tourism Development estimates the event will generate some $100 million in spending statewide. Solid attendance numbers are hard to come by, but in years past the event has drawn as many as 300,000 to the state based on highway toll data.Changing demographicsCrowds have been smaller in recent years, a fact often attributed to the advancing age of Baby Boomer bikers. Owner surveys conducted by the Motorcycle Industry Council late last year show statistics for American riders experienced some telling changes, including more college-educated and female riders, and a record number of motorcycles in households.“Demographics are changing for Americans across the country and it’s no different for motorcycle owners,” said MIC President and CEO Tim Buche. U.S. motorcycle ownership is more than 13.1 million, an increase of 2.5 million since the last ownership survey was taken in 2014.The median age of riders is 50, and increase of three years since 2014. Sixty-eight percent of riders are married, 24 percent are college educated and the have a median household income of $62,500.

If signed into law, it would repeal a bill passed last year, HB 1264.“The most serious concern with HB 1264 is that it links the act of registering to vote with the obligations to register your vehicle and obtain a New Hampshire driver’s license, both of which can be very expensive for college students and will create a burden attached to voting that will turn some away from the polls,” said Sen. Tom Sherman, D-Rye, in introducing the bill.“New Hampshire needs to encourage its students in civic participation and make them feel welcome. HB 106 will prevent HB 1264 from taking effect and ensure that voting in New Hampshire will continue to be uncomplicated and burden-free.”Sen. Regina Birdsell, R-Hampstead, who led the Republican election-law efforts in 2017-18, said repeal of HB 1264 will put the state back into what she called a “two-tiered system,” in which someone who is domiciled here and also a resident of the state must adhere to the laws of the state, while someone who is domiciled but not a resident doesn’t have to adhere to the laws of the state. That is not a fair system.”Gov. Chris Sununu initially expressed concerns about HB 1264 and last year requested an advisory opinion as to the bills constitutionality from the state Supreme Court. After the court ruled the law constitutional in a split decision, Sununu signed it into law.The Senate also passed a House bill (HB 504) calling on Congress to address campaign finance and gerrymandering — the drawing of electoral districts to benefit one party over the other — through constitutional amendments.“Roughly one-third of the communities across the state have already voted to send this message to Congress,” said Sen. Melanie Levesque, D-Nashua. “They want money out of politics and honest representation. This bill will show that we stand with them and will start to build public trust in our system.”Birdsell argued against the measure, pointing out that lawmakers have already passed a bipartisan bill to address gerrymandering. She also objected to a provision in the bill requiring the Legislature to host hearings with the state’s federal delegation on the election issues.“Why should the New Hampshire Legislature be doing the work of our congressional delegation?” she said. “We should not be taking time away from our constituents to deal with federal issues.”The bill passed along party lines, 14-10.The Senate shelved a bill (HB 556) that would have allowed municipalities to process absentee ballots prior to Election Day, referring it back to committee for further study.Other Senate billsManchester charter commission: A bill to allow Manchester to create a charter commission that could lead to an independent school district cleared the Senate on a voice vote.HB 544 will allow voters of Manchester to decide if they would like to impanel a Charter Commission, which could recommend a charter change to establish an autonomous School Board, whose budget would not have to be approved by aldermen.Voters would first have to create the charter commission, then vote on the charter changes it recommends.“This bill addresses only the school district and not other departments in the town,” according to Manchester State Rep. Pat Long, who is also a school board member.Manchester Sen. Lou D’Allesandro said the community needs to decide who is going to have final say over school finances.“It’s highly problematic what’s going on today … the battles between school board members and aldermen,” he said. “This gives the people of Manchester the opportunity to make a decision on a very significant issue.”PFAS study commission: A bill creating a commission to investigate the environmental and public health impacts of PFAS contamination in Merrimack, Bedford and Litchfield cleared the Senate on a voice vote.The vote came after Democrats defeated an amendment brought forward by Republicans to delay for up to two years new drinking water standards related to PFAS about to be released by state environmental officials, pending a cost-benefit analysis.dsolomon@unionleader.com"
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,Democrats push through Senate budget in wee hours,"Jun 6, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/politics/local/democrats-push-through-senate-budget-in-wee-hours/article_53d1df71-82a0-5112-b35a-f02f88ca4599.html,"CONCORD — The final horse trading over a compromise two-year state budget will start soon as Senate Democratic leaders just after midnight Friday approved a $13 billion spending proposal that suspends the next round of business tax cuts and uses proceeds to dramatically increase state aid to local communities.After more than 10 hours of debate, the Senate approved the plan, 14-9, with Sen. John Reagan, R-Deerfield, having had to leave the Senate chamber around 11 p.m. Thursday and missing the final tally.Senate Republicans time and again failed in attempts to change the plan as the Democratic majority beat back on 20 identical, 14-10 votes moves to retain business tax cuts, to get rid of a mandatory family and medical leave program, to build a larger secure psychiatric unit and to prevent using state money to pay for abortion services.Sen. Lou D’Allesandro, D-Manchester, said in response to the opposition of Gov. Chris Sununu this Senate plan made many changes to the budget the Democratically-led House of Representatives endorsed earlier this spring.“I am not saying we did it all but we did our very very best and this budget reflects our values,” D’Allesandro said.But Sununu said the Senate plan with its 12 percent increase in state spending was too excessive and would put the state on course for deficits in future years.“I continue to have concerns with the Senate’s budget; namely the income tax, the increase to business taxes, and the $76 million structural deficit. I am hopeful the House and Senate can come together in a committee of conference to put forward a viable, balanced budget that does not raise taxes,” Sununu said in a statement.“The people of New Hampshire sent us to Concord to deliver a responsible budget and I am committed to doing just that.”The House and Senate-passed budgets each spent about $5.5 billion in state spending with federal grants, fees, and private dollars making for the total.Sununu’s budget would spend $5.2 billion in state dollars. He called for spending more than $240 million of that in one-time spending for municipal and school construction projects, a process that both House and Senate budgets rejected.The Senate budget did remove a House-passed capital gains tax.The Senate budget still contains more than $134 million in higher taxes and fees by ending business tax cuts, by lining state taxes up with the 2017 federal tax cut treatment of corporate profits and by changing the tax structure to make firms pay more if they have sales here but not employees or offices in state.“We negated the capital gains tax. It is out. But what is in? Tax reform; it’s the kind of quality tax reform that makes this state economically sound,” D’Allesandro said.“We don’t need additional taxes.”Sen. Chuck Morse, R-Salem, said this plan raises business taxes by $90 million over the next two years because like the House budget it would repeal tax cuts that were on the books for 2019 and 2021.“I’m a country guy from Salem but $90 million more is a tax increase in my book,” Morse said.Sen. Jeb Bradley, R-Wolfeboro, offered the final amendment to keep in place those tax cuts on corporate profits (Business Profits Tax) and business activity (Business Enterprise Tax) that without change will be cut this July and in 2021.“We are at a crossroads,” Bradley said predicting the Senate-passed budget will lead to a “standoff” with Sununu and a summer without a compromise budget if these tax cuts aren’t retained.Sen. Jeanne Dietsch, D-Peterbough, said spending more on innovation and not granting business tax cuts would make New Hampshire more attractive for companies to come here. The average state spends $4.20 per person to subsidize research, she said.“What does New Hampshire spend? Ten cents,” Dietsch said.The Senate plan would give communities $20 million a year in grants towns could use for any purpose from lowering property taxes to new program costs. It would also increase aid to local school districts by $100 million.The family and medical leave plan contained in the so-called House budget trailer bill (HB 2) sparked some of the sharpest rhetoric.Sununu has called the proposal an income tax and vowed to veto it.The governor backed a voluntary leave program for state workers in this state and in Vermont but the Vermont Legislature adjourned for the year without taking it up.“Now we get to the family leave tax. It’s an income tax, a tax on payrolls on businesses like mine. I will make the decision whether to pay it for my business so it’s a tax,” Morse said.Senate Majority Leader Dan Feltes, D-Concord, said employers with at least 15 workers can on their own pay for this requirement of 12 weeks of paid leave without making workers pay a payroll tax of one-half of 1 percent.“It is a little tiring to hear this talking point over and over again. I can understand people outside here making this unsubstantiated claim but the people in this chamber are smart enough to know this operates like unemployment insurance with more flexibility for business including an optional payroll assessment to pay for it,” Feltes said.He said Sununu’s voluntary plan would not work.“The governor’s plan doesn’t exist. It was a press conference at a brewery. Vermont did nothing,” Feltes said.Senate Republicans also protested a provision that in 2020 would permit spending more state dollars to support Medicaid expansion that provides health care coverage to more than 50,000 people.Morse said this would break the promise lawmakers and then-Gov. Maggie Hassan, a Democrat, made that the state wouldn’t spend more than 10 percent for this program or Medicaid expansion for low-income adults would be abandoned.“Today we are going to throw that out the window and open up New Hampshire to payments into an account that isn’t even in our budget. It actually is the wrong thing to be doing,” Morse said.Sen. Cindy Rosenwald, D-Nashua, said senators recently learned the program by July 2020 could face a deficit of $2 million and this would allow Health and Human Services Commissioner Jeffrey Meyers to ask a legislative budget oversight committee to close the gap by transferring money within his own budget.“We are not trying to sneak general funds into this program; we are trying to be responsible,” Rosenwald said.Sen. Tom Sherman, D-Rye, said this would make sure New Hampshire keeps in place this expansion that is one of the best ways for New Hampshire to fight the opioid epidemic because it includes coverage for substance abuse services.“The notion that shoring up or providing some stabilization should we be unable to meet the obligations of the trust fund and that would be some kind of breach of an agreement. A breach would be to allow people to go uninsured,” Sherman said.The debate turned to abortion when Senate Democrats added language to allow state spending for abortion in response to the Trump administration’s “gag rule” that threatens to reduce federal grants for family planning.Sen. Regina Birdsell, R-Hampstead, said she only wanted to ban state spending for “optional abortion services” and not in cases of rape and incest.But Rosenwald said lawmakers need to be prepared to use state dollars to replace federal grants if Trump’s plan goes forward.klandrigan@unionleader.com"
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,Bill to allow historic horse racing gambling machines killed in bipartisan House vote,"Jun 6, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/politics/state/bill-to-allow-historic-horse-racing-gambling-machines-killed-in/article_5d6ca103-cd15-51ce-84a4-19de4a49140c.html,"CONCORD — An effort to introduce a new form of wagering at New Hampshire’s 16 charity gambling locations failed on Thursday.The House rejected a Senate-passed bill to allow historic horse racing video machines, which allows bettors to wager on horse races that have already happened.Supporters of the measure such as Rep. Patrick Abrami, R-Stratham, said it was necessary to help the 584 charities in the state that rely on revenue from charitable gambling avoid the diversion of New Hampshire gamblers to the new casino opening up in Everett, Mass.“The Lottery Commission agrees, especially in the southern tier, our charities are going to take a hit, so this comes in the nick of time,” he said.Critics of the proposal described the bill, SB 41, as a cleverly disguised effort to bring slot machines to New Hampshire.Rep. Jerry Stringham, D-Lincoln, said the 16 sites would share 800 to 1,000 machines, about 50 per location.“Combined with existing table games, these facilities will become mini-casinos. That’s very different from the way they operate today,” he said. “The proponents deny this, while at the same time saying they need these machines to compete with the real casinos like the one about to open in Everett, Mass.”The House has over the years repeatedly defeated casino bills sent over by the Senate.“We’ve been the backstop against casinos in this state,” said Stringham. “Please don’t be taken in by this backdoor effort to create not one but 16 casinos in our state.”The measure was defeated in a bipartisan vote, with 64 Democrats joining 93 Republicans.Lobbyist Rick Newman, who represented charities in the legislative process, said lawmakers were influenced by an aggressive lobbying campaign funded by the Oxford Casino in Maine.“The out-of-state casinos won today, but New Hampshire citizens lost,” he said.Other House billsWayfair decision: The House passed SB 242, a measure designed to help the state address last year’s Supreme Court decision in South Dakota v. Wayfair, in a 308-25 vote.The U.S. Supreme Court ruled last June that states like South Dakota, which has a sales tax, could collect that tax from online retailers in other states that sell to South Dakota customers, including the five states like New Hampshire that do not have a sales tax of their own.SB 242 prohibits other states or taxing jurisdictions from requesting information, conducting examinations or imposing sales tax obligations on sellers in New Hampshire, unless they register with and provide notice to the New Hampshire Department of Justice.The bill also establishes a commission to study ways to protect New Hampshire businesses from the uncertainty created by the Wayfair decision.“This is truly a rock-solid bipartisan effort, but our work may not be over,” said House Republican Leader Dick Hinch, R-Merrimack.“I look forward to continuing to work on this issue as the legal landscape develops. We must continue to be vigilant and not turn our state’s small businesses and entrepreneurs into tax collecting agents for other states and jurisdictions.”Commuter rail: The House voted 213-141 today to pass SB 241, which authorizes the DOT to apply for some $4 million in federal funds to complete a project development study for a rail connection to Boston, which is included in the governor’s 10-year transportation plan.The funds would pay for an engineering plan and environmental permitting, while establishing firm cost and revenue estimates.“The project development phase does not obligate the state to move forward with rail construction, but it will answer the questions about how much passenger rail would cost, how it would be paid for, and give us the necessary information to make informed decisions,” said Rep. Sue Newman, D-Nashua.Gov. Chris Sununu included a commuter rail connection to Boston in the state’s unsuccessful pitch to Amazon to build their second headquarters in New Hampshire.dsolomon@unionleader.com"
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,Letter: Extremely discouraging,"Jun 6, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/opinion/letters_to_editor/letter-extremely-discouraging/article_ad0bac01-a580-5ea6-870f-a1fe242d5edd.html,"To the Editor: The recent override of Gov. Chris Sununu’s veto of the death penalty repeal is extremely discouraging.By ignoring the voices of their constituents, our elected New Hampshire legislators are not only putting the lives of our brave police officers at risk, they are putting every citizen in New Hampshire at a higher risk to experience gun-related violence.Without the death penalty in place, there is less deterrent in place for organized crime operations, as due to the repeal of the death penalty, perpetrators of crimes deserving of the death penalty will at most face a sentence of lifetime in jail — a sentence that is of no consequence to some of these people, especially those who are mentally unwell.Our elected officials are not only failing to protect law enforcement and other public servants, they are also directly insulting the thoughtful citizens of New Hampshire.In the system that was in place before the override of the governor’s veto, in order for any person to be sentenced to death, the entire jury had to decide that the death penalty was a fair and just punishment for whatever crime was committed.Thus, by supporting an override of Governor Sununu’s veto, our lawmakers are not only demeaning the people of New Hampshire, they are failing to place their trust in us as we have in them.It is completely asinine to believe that any juror in New Hampshire would not responsibly use the power given to them.THAYER CARTERNew Boston"
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,Court says state education funding unconstitutional,"Jun 5, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/education/court-says-state-education-funding-unconstitutional/article_13726ebc-6df3-55dd-a9ca-2fcf60914c54.html,"KEENE — Cheshire Superior Court Judge David Ruoff ruled that the state’s formula for funding education is unconstitutional, according to a 98-page decision released Wednesday.“(The funding formula is) not only unsupported by the legislative record but (is) clearly or demonstratively inadequate according to the Legislature’s own definition of an adequate education,” Ruoff ruled.The Contoocook Valley Regional School District, based in Peterborough, first brought the lawsuit in March, claiming that the state’s adequacy grant of $3,636 per pupil wasn’t nearly enough to cover the costs of an education. The New Hampshire Supreme Court ruled in the 1980s and 1990s Claremont decisions that an adequate education is a fundamental right under the New Hampshire Constitution.“The district looks at this court decision as very positive,” said ConVal Superintendent Kimberly Rizzo Saunders.

Ruoff stopped short of telling the legislature what the formula for an adequate education should be, setting up potential legislative action to fix the problem. ConVal, through its lawsuit, is seeking close to $10,000 per student in adequacy grants.A statement from Gov. Chris Sununu’s office released late Wednesday states that the final say on education funding rests with the local communities.""The state is reviewing the order, but we continue to believe these critical funding decisions are best left to local elected leaders — who represent the people of New Hampshire — not judges in a courtroom,"" the statement reads.The statement also touts Sununu's support of stabilization grants and targets school building aid.ConVal is joined in the lawsuit by the Winchester, Monandnock and Mascenic school districts. The lawsuit used the state’s own data and the state’s funding formula to show that the current grants handed out to districts are not in line with the true costs of an education, according to court records.The state shortchanges the districts when it comes to covering costs such as transportation, facility maintenance, and teacher salary, pension and benefits, pushing the costs down onto local taxpayers, ConVal attorney Michael Tierney said during the March 29 evidentiary hearing.Tierney said that, for example, the state funding formula calculates for 25 to 30 students per teacher, when in reality the state knows that the average is closer to 10 students per teacher. The state also calculates that teacher benefits are around $11,000 per year, when it knows those costs are much greater, he added.The state claimed in court as part of its defense that things like transportation costs and facility costs are not part of an adequate education, and should not be included in the funding. Tierney, however, said during the hearing that the state funding formula actually includes money for transportation and facilities, through at a much lower rate that is actually spent by districts.Tierney said the state funds $195 per pupil for transportation and facilities, while New Hampshire Department of Education data shows the average cost is about $1,400 per pupil.ConVal is facing a looming budget crisis, as the annual district budget for its nine-town district gets closer to $50 million. Ruoff wrote in his decision that any legislative fix that pushed the costs of an adequate education onto the local communities would be “ripe for adjudication.”Ruoff additionally awarded the school districts attorney fees as part of his decision."
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,Bill to ease work requirement for Medicaid clears House,"Jun 5, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/politics/state/bill-to-ease-work-requirement-for-medicaid-clears-house/article_30b895d7-5c71-5961-af02-b5a9c3796099.html,"CONCORD — A Senate-passed bill to substantially weaken the work requirement in New Hampshire’s expanded Medicaid program cleared the House in a 207-143 party line vote on Wednesday, without a single Republican in support.The bill, SB 290, faces a likely veto from Gov. Chris Sununu, and did not pass in either chamber with veto-proof majorities.Among other things, it would end the work requirement entirely if it resulted in more than 500 people losing their benefits out of 50,000 in the expanded version of the federally funded health insurance program for low-income households.Other measures in SB 290 that would constrain the work requirement include applying it only to people 19 to 49 years of age, reducing required hours worked from 100 to 80, and basing it on an average of 20 hours per week instead of 25.The bill also adds self-employment and participation in mental illness recovery programs as activities that would satisfy the work requirement.An exemption from the work requirement for custodial parents or caretakers has been changed to apply in households with children up to the age of 16, as opposed to under the age of 6 in the existing statute.The bill also establishes exemptions from the work requirement for any beneficiary who is homeless, the caretaker of a grandchild, a full-time college or university student and anyone 50 or older.If the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) does not approve the work requirement as designed in the bill, the requirement could be eliminated.Democrats framed the bill as a measure to protect individuals from losing coverage, while Republicans called it a “broken promise.”“Make no mistake, SB 290 is a direct attack on the bipartisan compromise reached just last year on the Granite Advantage health care program,” said House Republican Leader Dick Hinch, R-Merrimack.“This bill significantly weakens the work requirement that has only just been implemented. I’m disappointed that Democrats broke a promise in an attempt to solve a problem that we’re not even sure exists.”The work requirement took effect on June 1, with reporting deadlines in July.“Individuals and families who rely on coverage provided by the Granite Advantage Health Care Program should not have to live in fear that they could lose their healthcare if they do not meet onerous reporting requirements,” said House Majority Leader Doug Ley, D-Jaffrey.The work requirement is also being challenged in federal court, where a judge has already rejected similar efforts in two other states.Other health-care billsThe House took action on several other Senate-passed bills related to health care, including:• Mental health parity: The House passed, on a voice vote, SB 272, requiring insurance companies to cover mental health or addiction conditions the same as physical ailments, with no additional limits on things like co-pays or number of visits.• Access to fertility care: Voting largely along party lines, 210-147, the House passed SB 279, requiring insurance companies to offer coverage for infertility treatment in group policies.• Health-care data: A bill creating a more robust and searchable healthcare database, with all personal information redacted (SB 111), passed the House on a voice vote, after an unsuccessful attempt by Republicans to have termination of pregnancies added to the data collected.“This chamber has already rejected a different method of collecting data about abortion statistics and sees no reason to revisit the issue in the context of this bill,” stated Rep. Gary Woods, D-Bow.dsolomon@unionleader.com"
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,NH House passes increase in minimum wage,"Jun 5, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/politics/state/nh-house-passes-increase-in-minimum-wage/article_72cdc926-5e42-5b30-8483-9386816fc7b1.html,"CONCORD — The House and Senate have now both passed bills raising the minimum wage, but with differences that will have to be resolved before the bill gets to Gov. Chris Sununu, who has said he believes minimum wage policies are a federal and not a state issue.The House on Wednesday passed Senate Bill 10, increasing the minimum wage, currently at the federal minimum of $7.25 an hour, to $10 in 2021 and $12 in 2022, but amended the bill to remove an exemption for employers offering at least 10 paid sick days per year.The bill passed the House along party lines, 209-139, with only three Republican votes. It will now go back to the Senate, which can either concur with the House changes or ask for a committee of conference in the hope of working out a compromise.The House has already seen its version of a minimum wage law held up in the Senate, which re-referred HB 186 to committee on May 30, leaving SB 10 as the only option left standing. Both bills share the goal of getting to $12 an hour by 2022, but differ in some details, such as treatment of tipped employees.“It’s clear that this minimum wage hike will most negatively impact New Hampshire’s small businesses and will needlessly increase their cost of doing business,” said House Republican Leader Dick Hinch, R-Merrimack.Democratic Senate President Donna Soucy, lead sponsor, applauded the House vote, suggesting some compromise is likely.“I’m grateful for the strong support from my colleagues thus far and look forward to continuing to shepherd this bill through the legislative process and onto Gov. Sununu’s desk because it’s far past time to raise New Hampshire’s minimum wage,” she said.Other House bills• Anti-discrimination: The House approved for the second time a bill prohibiting any discrimination in public schools, SB 263, despite warnings from opponents about transgender students born as males participating in female sports.The 214-141 vote was largely along party lines, with only two Republicans voting for the bill. It passed the Senate, 20-3, on March 28.The bill came about as one of the recommendations of Governor’s Advisory Council on Adversity and Inclusion. Sununu has expressed support for the concept of the bill, but concern about some of the details.• Election law: The House took action on two election-related bills that have already cleared the Senate.SB 66, which would prohibit candidates for Secretary of State from donating to candidates for state office, failed in a 224-125 vote. The bill had passed the Democratically controlled Senate in a voice vote.The House passed SB 156, in a vote of 212-139. The bill addresses what some have called “the LLC loophole,” by which individual donors create multiple limited liability corporations, each of which makes donations to an individual candidate. This enables the owner of multiple LLCs to skirt the state’s restrictions on individual campaign contributions.• Sexual harassment: The House voted 207-139 to pass SB 235, authorizing an independent human resources professional to handle sexual harassment complaints in the Legislature.“In addition to sending a powerful message that the (Legislature) takes complaints seriously, putting policy around sexual harassment into statute allows for a safer, more professional work environment that moves complaint investigations from political offices to a designated human resources professional,” said House Majority Leader Doug Ley, D-Jaffrey.dsolomon@unionleader.com"

Jay Inslee wasn’t shy Tuesday.That’s no surprise since Inslee has made climate change the centerpiece of his campaign and offered the most ambitious proposals on that front.“I was pleased that Vice President Biden issued a plan today. I think it’s great to see anybody’s ideas, but I have to express disappointment that the vice president’s proposals really lacked teeth and they lack ambition that is necessary to defeat the climate crisis. This is our last chance. We don’t have thirty years to get this job done. We’ve got to start acting now,” Inslee said.“So my plan puts up stop signs, and I’m afraid that the vice president’s plan does not. He has some wishes for thirty years from now, but we can’t wait thirty years. So I just believe we have to have a President who will look the CEOs in the eye of the oil and gas industry, here, and the coal industry and say, ‘We need to stand down. We need to put the interests of these kids who have asthma ahead of these corporate profits.’ We need a President who is willing to do that. I am willing to do that.”Then just as Biden was departing New Hampshire for a retail stop and two fund-raisers in Boston last Friday, his campaign confirmed to NBC News that Biden still supported the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits federal funding of abortions.A volunteer with the ACLU in South Carolina last month had asked Biden about it on camera and in that video Biden sounded like he favored repeal of the amendment he had supported throughout his career in Congress.A Biden campaign aide said the candidate misunderstood that question and he favors the amendment.The national Democratic Party platform calls for its repeal and many 2020 rivals have already offered proposals on reproductive rights that call for doing away with it.Biden left a retail stop at the Chez Vachon Restaurant on Manchester’s West Side Wednesday morning without taking questions about the controversy.Abortion rights organizations greeted the news with disgust, the National Abortion Rights Action League Ilyse Hogue writing, “That position is unjust and discriminatory and endangers women and families.”Adam Green with the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which has heaped praise on rival Elizabeth Warren, said the flap reveals why his liberal group views Biden as the “least electable candidate running” among the two dozen Democrats.While campaigning in Elkhardt, Ind., Warren took her own shot.“I’m out there fighting against the Hyde Amendment,” Warren told reporters.Meanwhile, the anti-abortion Americans United for Life praised Biden for maintaining his principled position.“As a pro-life Democrat, I applaud former Vice President Biden for his continuing support of the Hyde Amendment, which ensures that American taxpayer dollars do not fund optional, elective abortions,” said Tom Shakley, chief engagement officer.“It should not be a controversial stance to oppose public funding of optional procedures, and in fact it should be a common American value that, because abortion is always the deliberate, intentional, and forcible ending of a human life, it should be unthinkable. However, in today’s partisan and polarized climate, we’re grateful for Mr. Biden’s continuing support of the Hyde Amendment, even as we express skepticism of his ability to maintain this position in the face of his radical and extremist fellow contenders in the Democratic presidential race.”Despite losses, Biden puts faith in NHDuring an interview in Berlin, Biden said he’s confident he’ll win over voters in the first-in-the-nation primary state despite his disastrous performances in 1988 and 2008, the only two times he ran for President on his own.Biden of course won New Hampshire’s four electoral votes twice as Barack Obama’s vice presidential running mate in 2008 and 2012.“The truth is I never got to New Hampshire,” Biden said alluding to his past defeats.“I really like New Hampshire, the people are real and it reminds me of my state, though Delaware is more diverse. The plain fact is New Hampshire voters are extremely well-informed. It fascinates me and makes campaigning up here really exciting.”Biden said while he supports repeal of the Trump tax cuts, he will offer a plan to deliver tax cuts for working families. They will be paid for in part by raising the corporate tax rates, which Biden said Trump lowered too much, leading to record federal debt.“A lot of very wealthy people know they don’t need that tax cut,” Biden said.He warned if Trump gets reelected he’ll pursue cuts to Social Security and Medicare in order to reduce the $17 trillion debt.“Mark my words; that’s where he would go, attacking the safety net,” Biden said.Another NH House special election on the wayA second House Republican has stepped down and this vacancy could touch off a very crowded primary.One-term state Rep.

What is a greater intrusion on workers’ everyday lives than having a portion of every dollar they earn go toward a government-sponsored and -mandated program?Senate Bill 1, sponsored by New Hampshire Senate Majority Leader Dan Feltes, is mandatory paid family leave insurance program is a supposed solution to one problem that creates another larger problem in the form of an income tax. While there is widespread and bipartisan support for paid family leave insurance, the same cannot be said about an income tax. Paid family leave at any cost does not have bipartisan support.An income tax flies in the face of our longstanding tradition of opposing this kind of taxation. Our lack of an income tax, combined with a lack of a sales tax, are large parts of what makes New Hampshire such a great place to be. New Hampshire has one of the lowest overall tax burdens of any state in the nation. If Democrat state legislators have their way, our tax advantage over other states will be eroded, if not eliminated.We don’t want the government to offer a new benefit while undermining our values and traditions, especially when there are ways to bring both sides together to offer a plan that doesn’t call for an income tax.

Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,Kathy Sullivan: Sununu's Senate skip hints at tough road for GOP,"Jun 5, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/opinion/columnists/kathy-sullivan-sununu-s-senate-skip-hints-at-tough-road/article_cb06b333-6ef9-50fb-820b-9ffcdc7a4c05.html,"As expected by many political observers, Gov. Chris Sununu has announced that he will not run against Senator Jeanne Shaheen.Less expected was Sununu dropping his carefully cultivated “nice guy” image, when he boasted that he would have beaten Shaheen, and said she was the least accomplished two-term senator ever in the history of New Hampshire.I doubt Sununu knows the names and histories of every two-term Granite State senator. The longest serving was Jacob Harold Gallinger. He died in office in 1918, after serving 27 years. He also was a three- term chairman of the Republican State Committee while in the senate, giving that organization more continuity than we have seen in this century.While I enjoy hyperbole as much as the next person, Sununu’s comments were over the top. Just by being elected to the Senate, Jeanne Shaheen did something that no one else, including Mr. Gallinger, had ever accomplished: the first woman in the country ever elected governor also to be elected to the Senate. Sununu errs in minimizing that accomplishment, as it was a big deal.Shaheen continues to be a trailblazer. She is the only woman sitting on both the Senate Foreign Relations and the Armed Services Committees. She has worked tirelessly to protect the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, including stopping Donald Trump from including it in his raid on defense spending.She was recently instrumental in adding $10,000,000 to the Defense Authorization Bill for a study of the impact of toxic PFAS chemicals in water, with Pease International Tradeport serving as the model site. Thousands of people in the area have been exposed to PFAS.In addition to these and many other legislative accomplishments, Shaheen’s office also is known for being top-notch in performing constituent services.Given all of that, Sununu’s claim that he would have beaten Shaheen rang a little hollow. It was like a little boy boasting he could have climbed that mountain — but he didn’t really feel like climbing a mountain, so he didn’t bother to try.There currently are three Republicans expressing interest in trying to climb the mountain. Bill O’Brien, the former speaker of the New Hampshire House of Representatives, is in the dominant, Trump wing of the GOP. A YouTube video of him speaking at a recent local Republican meeting shows him comparing himself to Trump.Retired Brig. Gen. Donald Bolduc is considering a run. He is highly-decorated, but his traditional, non-Trumpian conservatism and calls for consensus make his path to the nomination in these times very tough, despite his resume.Then there is Colorado attorney Bryant “Corky” Messner, the latest Republican who thinks having a New Hampshire resort vacation home is a ticket to elective office. He may want to check in with Scott Brown and Walt Havenstein on that. He also will need to explain why, if he is a New Hampshire resident, he still is listed as the CEO of his large Denver law firm. He also will need to explain to Republicans that large donation he made to New York Senator Chuck Schumer.At this point, given the current ideological tilt of the New Hampshire Republican Party, O’Brien has the edge. However, it will be a tough general election race for him if nominated.If it was an easy race, Sununu’s decision probably would have been very different."

CONCORD - Back in his late 20s, Gordon J. MacDonald, the Deering Republican likely to become New Hampshire's next attorney general, wasn't eve…




“Gordon has served this state with distinction as Attorney General for the last two years and I am honored to nominate him to lead our state’s highest court,” said Sununu.MacDonald stood by Sununu last week as the two announced a multimillion-dollar lawsuit against some of the world’s largest chemical companies over contamination of New Hampshire’s water and other natural resources.Since taking office in 2017, MacDonald has coordinated the state’s legal response to the threat of an internet sales tax and worked with Sununu to establish the Department of Justice’s first-ever Civil Rights Unit“During his time as attorney general, Gordon’s leadership skills, along with his independence, have been on full display. Gordon has never been afraid to follow the path or take the action that he believes is right, even when that course may not be the easiest and even when some, including myself, may disagree with him,” said Sununu.“I am confident that, if confirmed, Gordon will use his unparalleled legal talents and fair-minded approach to lead our judicial branch with distinction.”Under MacDonald’s leadership, the DOJ recently represented the state Lottery Commission in a federal lawsuit, with a ruling just announced on Monday.U.S. District Court Judge Paul Barbadoro ruled federal law restricting interstate gambling applies only to bets or wagers on sporting events — and not online lottery games.The ruling protects millions in yearly lottery revenue earmarked for education funding.On MacDonald’s recommendation, the legislature recently established a new position dedicated to the training and professional development of all prosecutors in the state, including at the county and municipal levels. He also appointed the first-ever director of communications for the Department of Justice.Commercial litigationPrior to serving as Attorney General, MacDonald was a partner at Nixon Peabody in Manchester, where he developed a reputation as one of the state’s top commercial litigation attorneys.A graduate of Dartmouth College and Cornell Law School, MacDonald has been a member of the New Hampshire Bar since 1995 and successfully handled a number of high-profile cases in both state and federal court.“The New Hampshire judiciary plays a vital role in the lives of the people of our state,” MacDonald said. “The prospect of serving as the leader of this branch of government is truly humbling.”The Executive Council will hold a public hearing on the nomination and a confirmation vote will likely take place at a subsequent Governor and Council meeting.With MacDonald’s confirmation, Sununu will have appointed three of the five justices, having previously nominated incumbent justices Anna Barbara “Bobbie” Hantz Marconi and Patrick E. Donovan.Lynn, who was tapped by Sununu for the chief justice job in 2018 after serving as an associate justice for seven years, had nothing but praise for his likely successor.“I have known Gordon MacDonald for many years. He is truly a great person and an outstanding lawyer,” said Lynn, describing MacDonald as “smart, hardworking, and thoughtful.”“His temperament and fair mindedness make him eminently well-qualified to serve as the next Chief Justice of the New Hampshire Supreme Court.”New judge nominatedIn addition to a new attorney general, Sununu is likely to be looking for a new chairman of the Public Utilities Commission.The governor also announced that he will nominate incumbent PUC Chairman Martin “Marty” Honigberg to serve as a superior court judge.Honigberg was appointed to the PUC in 2013 and became chairman in December 2014. Prior to his time at the PUC, he was a partner at Sulloway & Hollis, where he practiced in commercial litigation and administrative law.From 2001 to 2003, Honigberg served as special counsel to Gov. Jeanne Shaheen and as a senior assistant attorney general from 1994-2000."

She has lost an estimated $500 a month after Jim Grant, director of Rochester’s building, zoning and licensing services, informed her two months ago she could no longer sell CBD gummy bears, CBD lollipops and “hard” candy.“It’s at least 10 percent of my business and only being here two years, it’s made a huge difference. This is the only city in the state right now doing this,” Sondrini said.Sondrini can still sell CBD oil, wraps, vapes and oil for pets, but said people prefer the edibles.“It’s easy, you can pop it in your mouth. You can eat it almost anytime,” Sondrini said.Sondrini is not the only downtown business affected by the crackdown. Just down the street from Puglife Smoke & Vape, Fresh Vibes has been selling CBD-infused coffee, for almost a year. The owners had plans to add edibles to their menu.Cannabidiol, the non-psychoactive ingredient in hemp and marijuana, has become popular in recent years. Shops throughout the Seacoast region sell CBD products for customers with different health ailments such as arthritis and insomnia.Recent research at the Addiction Institute of Mount Sinai showed CBD could also help treat opioid addiction.On Tuesday afternoon, officials from the city of Rochester issued a press release to local businesses, saying CBD-infused foods and drinks are banned under federal law and are unlawful under New Hampshire’s Food Protection program.“Once it came to our attention that these businesses were violating these state regulations, we took corrective action that we believe was appropriate and fair to our businesses,” Grant said in a statement.Officials say businesses that continue to violate state and federal regulations run the risk of having their food licenses revoked by the Rochester Board of Health.Not all of the businesses have complied with the request to remove CBD-infused foods and drinks. At the Shell on Washington Street, there are still gummies right next to the cash register.“One guy came in and was making a big stink, but I told him unless my boss tells me to take it down, I’m keeping it up,” an employee working the cash register said Tuesday.A petition to Gov. Chris Sununu is being circulated, asking him to sign legislation to allow New Hampshire businesses to sell and serve CBD-infused foods and drinks. Maine’s governor, Janet Mills, has signed similar legislation.Brightfield Group, an industry analyst, estimated the U.S. CBD market was at $591 million in 2018.They say the hemp-CBD market could hit $22 billion by 2022."

Chris Sununu on Monday vetoed House Bill 365, the latest effort by the state Legislature to encourage bigger solar energy projects in the state.The bill changes the limit on net metering. Net metering enables the owners of solar panels to sell excess energy back into the grid. HB 365 changes the limit from 1 megawatt to 5 megawatts.That would set the stage for some large commercial or municipal solar arrays that are now in the planning stages.The governor and other opponents have argued that the higher-priced solar energy sold back into the grid increases costs for customers not benefiting from solar installations.“This bill is a regressive cost burden on all citizens that benefits large-scale solar developers while hurting all ratepayers, including the elderly and those on fixed incomes,” said Sununu in his veto statement.“We should not force our ratepayers to massively subsidize those who can afford to construct 40-acre solar farms.”Supporters argue that the rate impact is minimal while the savings on transmission costs would be substantial, since the electricity is generated locally.“With his veto pen, Gov. Sununu is holding New Hampshire back from making progress on clean energy jobs, lowering electric rates and property taxes, and building a better future for our children,” said Senate Majority Leader Dan Feltes, D-Concord. “Governor Sununu’s veto is a big win for out-of-state fossil fuel interests and a big loss for New Hampshire families, businesses and communities.”Sununu successfully vetoed a similar bill last year, but this year’s version passed both House and Senate with veto-proof margins, so a successful override vote at some point in the near future is more likely."

Chris Sununu. “New Hampshire stood up, took action, and won — all to protect public education in our state.”Charlie McIntyre, the lottery commission’s executive director, said that the judge “appreciated the strength of our argument and the potential impacts this DOJ (Department of Justice) opinion stood to have in New Hampshire with more than $90 million in revenue for education at stake.”The judge dismissed the U.S. Department of Justice’s argument that the lottery commission lacked standing to be allowed to sue.“Based on the text, context, and structure of the Wire Act, I also conclude that the Act is limited to sports gambling,” the judge wrote in his analysis of the Wire Act of 1961.The closely watched case had attracted “friend of the court” briefs from New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Michigan supporting New Hampshire’s legal efforts.The New Hampshire Lottery Commission offers tickets for multi-state games such as Powerball and Mega Millions that permit tickets to be purchased either in stores or through the internet. Each game involves the use of interstate wire transmissions.“We are extremely pleased with the court’s decision, which represents a victory for the New Hampshire Lottery, state lotteries across the country and the revenue they provide to their communities,” McIntyre said.The commission convinced a judge to rule that the wire act didn’t extend to state-conducted lottery activities and to set aside the 2018 opinion from the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel.The judge said “nothing the Department of Justice said or did before the plaintiffs filed their complaints gave states like New Hampshire any reason to believe that state actors would not be prosecuted under the OLC’s new interpretation of the Wire Act.”The judge wrote, “In summary, this is no hypothetical case: The plaintiffs have demonstrated with specific record evidence that they had standing when they filed suit because a sufficiently imminent threat of enforcement loomed.”A spokesperson for the Justice Department said “DOJ is reviewing the decision and declines to comment further at this time.”mcousineau@unionleader.com"
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,Budget debate reflects conflicting visions for state's future,"Jun 2, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/politics/state/budget-debate-reflects-conflicting-visions-for-state-s-future/article_36616282-16c5-5486-b521-6feba41ef2e5.html,"CONCORD — New Hampshire now has three different versions of a state budget for the two years beginning on July 1 — one from Gov. Chris Sununu, one approved by the House and a third proposed on Friday by the Senate Finance Committee.They each present a different vision for how to address some of the state’s most pressing problems — including the opioid epidemic, mental health services, child protection and state funding for education — in a $13 billion budget with about half the money from federal sources.The governor's budget calls for $12.686 billion in spending over the two years from the state general fund, education trust fund, and other state and federal funding sources.That's $324,629 million less than the $13.011 billion total state spend in the House budget, and $240,204 million less than the $12.927 billion total state spend in the Senate budget.In the end, no single version will prevail, as the final product always represents some compromise among the three major players.Sununu has made clear that he would veto the House budget, which contains a new tax on capital gains to boost education aid and a family medical leave plan funded by a 0.5% payroll withholding that Republicans have labeled an income tax.Senate Finance Chairman Lou D’Allesandro says it fell to his committee to find some middle ground between the House proposal and the governor’s position, to ensure that lawmakers present a budget Sununu can sign.













SEN. LOU D’ALLESANDRO


“I hope he’s going to look at what we’ve done and think about it,” D’Allesandro said Friday as he and other members of the Finance Committee prepared to present their version of the budget to the full Senate for a vote next week.The goal is to avoid a budget veto, which would force weeks of negotiations into the summer with the state operating at existing spending levels, known as a continuing resolution.“Let’s hope we come to the most desirable solution,” said D’Allesandro. “A continuing resolution doesn’t do anything positive. We want to do positive things and we’re on that path. We’ve been in communication with the governor’s office and haven’t done this in a vacuum. There are negotiations and dialogue that have been taking place all the time.”Family medical leaveThe proposed Senate budget includes the Family and Medical Leave Act program that Sununu has vowed to veto. The governor proposed his own plan in cooperation with Vermont, but the Legislature in that state adjourned without adopting the Twin State Voluntary Leave Plan.The Senate proposal also concurs with the House on revoking cuts in business taxes that were scheduled to take effect for the tax years 2019 and 2021.Senators break with their counterparts in the House on increased aid to education and how to pay for it. The House wants to provide $164 million in new education aid, mostly for property-poor school districts, funded by a new tax on capital gains.The Senate proposal eliminates the capital gains tax, but still adds $100 million in new state funding for local public schools, most of it coming from changes to the way the state taxes businesses, but not the rates at which they are taxed.The Senate would align the state’s business tax structure with the 2017 federal tax cut, which reduced corporate tax rates but broadened the base of business activity subject to taxation.Another change would see businesses pay taxes on profits they earn from activity in New Hampshire, even if they have no headquarters or offices in the state.“It’s a balanced budget with no new taxes and no new fees,” said Senate Majority Leader Dan Feltes, D-Concord. “It addresses several of the crises facing the state and expands opportunities for everyone.”Republicans argue there are new taxes in the House and Senate plan, most prominently the 0.5% levy on payrolls, should employers decide to take that route to fund paid family leave.“You can call the new tax a premium on wages, an income tax, or another new tax entirely — but it is still a new tax that is being levied to pay for their program,” said Sununu spokesman Ben Vihstadt.Republicans also point to the fact that the plan eliminates business tax cuts. They consider that a tax increase.“In their budget the Business Profits Tax (BPT) went from 7.7% to 7.9% and Business Enterprise Tax (BET) went from 0.6% to 0.675%,” Vihstadt said. “The rates already went down on January 1, 2019, and this budget would reverse that reduction, and completely eliminate the rates that are scheduled to go down even more on January 1, 2021.”Infrastructure fundLike the House plan, the Senate plan eliminates what has become known as the Governor’s Infrastructure Fund — $52 million over two years for upgrades and renovations in a mix of projects approved by Sununu in communities from Manchester to Berlin.The Senate proposal instead includes $20 million a year in unrestricted aid to municipalities that the municipalities can spend as they see fit, based on a formula that takes into account a community’s public school enrollment and the number of children on free and reduced lunch.Manchester, for example, would get nearly $3 million in the first year, while Rye would see $23,000.The proposed Senate budget, approved by the Senate Finance Committee in a party-line, 4-2 vote, also includes a 3.1% increase in Medicaid rates to all providers, worth about $60 million a year.Psychiatric bedsOther highlights include a $6.5 million investment in loan repayment assistance for health care workers, and the creation of a new 25-bed secure psychiatric unit, which is smaller than the 60-bed unit proposed by Sununu, but is more than what the House proposed.All three budget proposals include funding to create more psychiatric beds and ease the boarding of patients in emergency rooms.“I appreciate that today’s vote by the Senate Finance Committee is another step in the budget process and acknowledge their budget contains some improvements from the House’s proposal,” said Sununu on Friday.“I am determined to pass a budget that does not raise taxes and is fiscally solvent, and look forward to continuing to work with the Legislature so that we can come together on a commonsense compromise that balances the needs of the state with the concerns of our taxpayers.”Areas of possible compromise include the Senate giving up on family medical leave, at least for this year; the governor agreeing to no further reductions in business taxes; and the House sacrificing its proposed capital gains tax.After the Senate passes its version of the budget, a joint Finance Committee of House and Senate negotiators will begin meeting to hammer out a single budget both chambers can pass and send along to Sununu, in the hope that a new budget can be in place when the current spending and revenue plan expires June 30.dsolomon@unionleader.com"

Chris Sununu created to identify the best way to expand access on the state’s fifth largest lake that has no state-controlled, deep water boat launch.For 28 years, the Fish and Game Commission had been pursuing a new launch on the so-called Wild Goose site that was opposed by lake resident groups and local boards from abutting towns due to concerns over traffic and environmental impacts.House Deputy Speaker Karen Ebel, D-New London, was one of the leaders in the campaign to block Fish and Game from developing Wild Goose, a former hotel and campsite the state acquired in 1990.She agreed this expansion must happen in a way that doesn’t spoil what makes the park’s beach such a popular spot for residents and tourists to visit.“State Parks sees its main mission in that location as the state beach and park experience, not boating but improving the already popular ramp in a location that is not fraught with traffic safety problems. (This) is, to our mind, the best thing to do under the circumstances,” Ebel said Saturday.“We are thankful for the funding and the Legislature’s support of this project. It’s a great compromise in the best New Hampshire way.”Sen. David Watters, D-Dover, chairs the Senate Capital Budget Committee.“It may not be ideal to have a boat launch and a beach in the same place but this makes sense and it does away with the Wild Goose project that was such a political fiasco,” Watters said. “We are told this is workable and it will be good to get this done.”Ebel said this project would include dredging the beach launch to accommodate larger boats.Still searchingFish and Game officials have said if this came to pass they would continue to search for other deep-water public access points along the lake.The Sunapee boat ramp work is one of the few changes lawmakers made to the capital budget that Sununu first proposed last February.The two-term Republican Sununu along with his GOP allies continues to fight against House and Senate budget writers over spending and tax changes for the two-year operating budget.Sununu has already threatened to veto that plan if it spends too much or contains new taxes.In contrast, lawmakers from both parties have overwhelmingly embraced the few alterations to Sununu’s capital budget and the governor hasn’t to date signaled any disagreements with them.House Public Works and Highways Chairman John Cloutier, D-Claremont, said he’ll recommend his committee next week endorse those changes the Senate made to the budget the House passed on a 362-5 vote in April.“I would hope we could concur but it’s up to the final committee; they have the final say,” Cloutier said.Serving his 14th term on the panel, Cloutier said he could only recall one other time in 2001 when reaching agreement on a capital budget did not require naming a team of negotiators from the House and Senate to hammer out the differences.“Both sides and both parties have really kept in close contact throughout the process,” Cloutier said.Site was 2017 roadblockThe Wild Goose controversy was one of the bitter fights over the capital budget in 2017.At that time, former House Speaker Gene Chandler, a Bartlett Republican, had backed the development while ex-Senate President Chuck Morse, R-Salem, was set against it.Ultimately, a $2 million expansion for the Wild Goose property was taken out of the final compromise.Weeks later, in July 2017, Sununu sealed the project’s fate when he pulled the plug on extending an environmental permit needed to keep the Wild Goose design alive.The capital budget passing the Senate 24-0 last week contained more than $300 million in total spending, including about $125 million in state-backed bonds that leveraged more than $150 million in federal grants.Another $24 million would come from highway fund expenses and nearly $8 million from other sources.Agriculture Commissioner Shawn Jasper, a former House speaker from Hudson, brokered another compromise to complete on time a $17 million renovation of the Hudson Career and Technical Education Center.The state would spend nearly $14.5 million and under this concept the trustees of a nonprofit dedicated to improvements at Alvirne High School in Hudson would loan the state the rest of the money.Under this deal, the state would pay back that loan in the next capital budget.Without this additional money, Jasper said the project would be delayed and it would cost taxpayers another $900,000.Jasper said he’s not aware this loan concept has ever been used in the past.“It is unique but this trust that supports Alvirne has some assets. As long as the trustees go along with it, this is a way to keep this renovation and upgrade of the center on schedule, and it’s really long overdue,” Jasper said.Other projects would complete renovations at the Rochester technical high school and a life science building at the University of New Hampshire in Durham; upgrade the access road to the minimum security prison in Berlin; and start the process for upgrading an engineering technology building at Nashua Community College.“Much of our focus with this budget is on work force development because the labor pool is so tight and employers are crying out for more trained workers,” Sen. Watters added.klandrigan@unionleader.com"

Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,Dave Solomon's State House Dome: Medicaid work rule now in effect,"May 31, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/politics/statehouse_dome/dave-solomon-s-state-house-dome-medicaid-work-rule-now/article_90da285f-3c28-5936-a701-dca050a30307.html,"June 1 was a red-letter day for more than 50,000 New Hampshire residents who get their medical coverage from the expanded Medicaid program, known as Granite Advantage Health Care.











That’s when a new work or community engagement program kicked in, requiring anyone covered by Medicaid through Granite Advantage to complete 100 hours of work or approved community activities each month to maintain medical coverage, unless they are exempt due to medical frailty or other circumstances listed in the law.Republicans reluctantly agreed to the Granite Advantage program last year, under the condition that a work requirement be instituted for able-bodied adults up to age 64 in the program, and Democrats went along.With Democrats in the majority this year, they are working to basically revoke the work requirement by amending it through a bill, SB 290, that among other things would terminate the requirement if more than 500 people lose coverage.The House is scheduled to take its final vote Wednesday on the Senate bill. After that it heads to the desk of Gov. Chris Sununu, a strong supporter of the work program who is likely to veto the bill.The fate of the work requirement is more likely to be determined in the federal courts, where the same judge who rejected Medicaid work requirements in Arkansas and Kentucky is hearing arguments in the New Hampshire case.U.S. District Court Judge James Boasberg ruled in late March that the Arkansas and Kentucky work requirement programs hurt Medicaid’s basic purpose of providing health coverage to low-income households.Thousands of people in both states lost coverage, according to critics of the plans, because they either could not fulfill the requirements despite good-faith efforts, or they could not complete the complicated paperwork to verify their compliance.Republicans say they are willing to address that problem if and when it occurs, but for now there is no problem.While SB 290 works its way to the governor’s desk and a likely veto, and the court challenge continues in Washington, D.C., officials at the Department of Health and Human Services have notified Granite Advantage members, identified as “mandatory participants” that they need to get to work.The warning in letters that went out on May 8 make clear that “If you do not meet the 100 monthly hour requirement and you are not exempt, your Medicaid eligibility could be suspended.”Those receiving the letters have a July 7 deadline to report June hours. That’s also when the appeals or “curing” process begins for anyone who did not meet 100 hours or get an exemption.It will be some time in August before people start to receive loss-of-coverage notices.Meanwhile, another intervener has jumped into the federal lawsuit on the side of plaintiffs like New Hampshire Legal Assistance.The amicus brief filed on May 23 by a group of public health professors at George Washington University calls New Hampshire’s Medicaid work experiment “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion and contrary to law.”“Like the others, New Hampshire’s (work requirement) threatens coverage for thousands of poor people. Its lack of any reasonable basis is especially striking in New Hampshire, whose unemployment rate, even among older workers, is virtually nonexistent,” said Sara Rosenbaum, one of the health policy scholars represented by the brief.“Like Arkansas and Kentucky, the New Hampshire program lacks the requisite elements of sound social policy research; the Trump administration has unlawfully deployed experimental authority simply to strip the poor of health insurance.”Washington University public health researchers estimate that between 15,000 and 23,000 New Hampshire Medicaid recipients will lose coverage in the first year alone.“New Hampshire’s proposed work requirements are the harshest to date,” according to the brief.“In a state with one of the nation’s lowest unemployment rates and an economy with a large number of seasonal and part-time jobs, officials nonetheless require at least 25 hours per week of work, with a limited opportunity to make up for any hourly deficits before coverage ends.”Whether the program will survive long enough to see people actually lose coverage in August remains to be seen, but the switch has been flipped.dsolomon@unionleader.com"

David Watters, D-Dover, chair of the Senate Capital Budget Committee.“The projects for which money is appropriated will create jobs for many small and large contracting businesses throughout our state.”He said the committee worked hard to spread the projects to all corners of the state, “from the Connecticut River Valley, to the North Country, to the Southern Border and the Seacoast.”Election billsThe Senate acted on several election-related bills that already passed the House, most of which are designed to reverse changes to election law passed by Republicans in the previous two sessions of the legislature.HB 105, which reverses election laws passed last year regarding domicile and processes for voter verification, passed in a party line, 14-10 vote.HB 611, allowing voters to vote by absentee ballot without having to provide a reason, passed 13-11, with Democratic Sen. President Donna Soucy voting with Republicans.HB 315, which repeals the authorization of the Secretary of State to share voter information and data with the Interstate Voter Registration Crosscheck Program passed along party lines, 14-10.The bill requires the Secretary of State to enter into an agreement with a different organization to share voter information, since Crosscheck has been disbanded.Other Senate votes• Legalizing marijuana: Without discussion, the Senate referred HB 481 for further consideration by its Judiciary Committee in a voice vote, putting the question to rest for this year.• Minimum wage: HB 186, a bill raising the state’s minimum wage to $12 over three years, stalled in the Senate, despite having passed the House 210-145 in March. Senators from both parties believe the bill needs more work, and it was referred to a Senate committee for further study.• Employment applications: HB 211, prohibiting employers from requiring past salary history on job application, and HB 293, prohibiting employers from inquiring about credit history, both cleared the Senate in 13-11 votes.• Sports betting: HB 480 passed on a voice vote in the Senate after clearing the House 269-82 in March. It was a priority for Gov. Chris Sununu in his second inaugural address. The bill establishes a system managed by the lottery commission for gambling on a variety of sporting events as of Jan. 1, 2020.• Campaign funds for child care: The Senate voted 15-9 to pass HB 651, allowing the use of campaign funds for child care expenses.In 2017, the Federal Election Commission (FEC) ruled that congressional candidates can use campaign funds for child care; HB 651 is an effort to implement that ruling for state and local candidates in New Hampshire.dsolomon@unionleader.com"

Chris Sununu and the state’s Congressional delegation shared a common theme in their remarks at Memorial Day ceremonies at the New Hampshire State Veterans Cemetery on Thursday — those who served should be remembered daily.Retired U.S. Marine Corps Lt. Col. Michael Moffett shared a history lesson with the hundreds who attended and recounted the pivotal role Gen. John Stark and the New Hampshire men he led played in defeating the British at Bennington, Vt., a win that reinvigorated the Continental Army.With Gen. John Burgoyne’s army on the march south from Canada in an attempt to split away New England and end the rebellion, settlers in Vermont asked for help from New Hampshire. The request sparked spirited debate in the Provincial Congress, with the majority sharing the belief that there was no time, or money to respond.Moffett’s fifth-great grandfather, Nathaniel Balch Sr., was among those who turned to Gen. Stark who had retired from the Continental Army in disgust. Stark agreed to answer the call to arms on the condition that he only answer to New Hampshire and not army leadership.The word went out that General Stark needed help and, Moffett said, many of the men who tilled the fields where they were now standing fell in step. Citizen soldiers responded and among those joining the 1,500 volunteers was Nathaniel Balch Jr.As Stark and his troops marched through Vermont, they learned Hessian troops were en route to Bennington to resupply and made ready to meet them.“Yonder comes our enemy and they are ours or tonight Molly Stark sleeps alone,” Stark said.The better equipped and trained British troops were defeated and their myth of invincibility shattered, Moffett recounted.Emil Ouellette, department commander of The American Legion that is celebrating its 100th anniversary this year told the audience, “Their duty was to serve. Our duty is to remember.”“We can never repay the debt, but we can honor them, remember them and cherish their families not just this day but every day and this we will do.”Gov. Sununu said there is an obligation to demonstrate for future generations the eternal gratitude that is offered to those who served.“Collective gratitude defines us and is why we are just a little bit better than everyone else,” he said.Sen. Maggie Hassan, D-NH, said respect and remembrance should not be reserved for one day on the calendar.Rep. Chris Pappas, D-NH, said for every solider lost there is a family suffering unimaginable grief. The smallest of gestures can make a big difference.During the Memorial Day parade in Manchester, he said, he was approached by a distraught woman who told him she was not able to see her husband who is buried at the veterans cemetery. Pappas said he called cemetery director Shawn Buck and he made sure someone was available to drive her.He urged people to support Gold Star families and veterans who have returned home.Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-NH, said veterans should be honored not only for the risks that they take but for the humility with which they serve and their conviction to the nation’s cause.She recounted assisting in getting a Purple Heart medal for World War II veteran Francis Byrne, who earned it in a cornfield in Belgium when a fellow soldier stepped on a mine, sending shrapnel into Byrne’s leg. When a medic came to tend to the wound, Bryne told him to help others. He was never treated and continued to fight.“That act of selflessness made it take 70 years for his country to recognize him,” Shaheen said."

Renny Cushing of Hampton and members of his family watched the historic vote from the gallery, as death penalty opponents withstood a strong lobbying effort by Sununu and active members of law enforcement throughout the state.Cushing, whose father was murdered in 1988, has championed repeal of the death penalty in New Hampshire for decades.“The Senate vote to finally abolish the death penalty in New Hampshire is a remarkable moment in our state’s history,” he said.The Senate first voted 17-6 on April 11 to pass the repeal measure, HB 455.Manchester State Sen. Lou D’Allesandro, who was absent for the April 11 vote, has been a consistent supporter of the death penalty and voted Thursday to uphold the veto.

Vote changesNorth Country Republican Sen. David Starr, who on April 11 voted for repeal, changed his vote on Thursday to support Sununu, but it was not enough to turn the tide.Sununu came within one vote of having his veto sustained in the House, which voted last week to override the veto, 247-123, just meeting the two-thirds requirement.Repeal of the death penalty was a major initiative for the Democratic leadership in House and Senate. The deciding vote in the House was cast by House Speaker Steve Shurtleff, while the final vote in the Senate was cast by Senate President Donna Soucy.Supporters of the death penalty focused most of their arguments on a call for justice in the 2006 murder of Manchester police Officer Michael Briggs by convicted felon Michael Addison, who is awaiting execution.Opponents of the repeal measure argued that Addison will escape execution, even though the bill states that the repeal is not retroactive.“If you think you are passing this today and Mr. Addison is still going to remain on death row, you are confused,” said Sen. Sharon Carson, R-Hudson.She pointed to Connecticut, which had several death-row inmates whose sentences were reduced to life in prison after that state’s repeal of capital punishment. “You have to think about the police officers and what they face every day,” she said.Public supportSen. Melanie Levesque, D-Nashua, reiterated many of the arguments against capital punishment that came up in the months of hearings and debate leading up to the vote, including the disproportionate number of black people who are executed, the high cost of executions and the execution of people later found to be innocent.Carson, echoing Sununu, framed the issue as a matter of public support for law enforcement.“Police officers are feeling under fire, not supported and alienated,” she said. “They need to know that we have their backs. That we support them. This is about justice, and the people’s will.”Sen. Harold French, R-Franklin, said the vote was a matter of conscience.“Today I will vote to override the veto not due to some lack of respect for the great guidance (Sununu) has shown the state, and not because of a lack of compassion for the sacrifices made in the call of duty by our law enforcement personnel and their families,” he said. “My vote will be made because this vote is about our state, and about what kind of state we are all going to be a part of.”Police disappointedPolice Capt. Patrick Cheetham, immediate past president of the N.H. Police Association, said police are “frustrated and disappointed” with the vote.“We believe that it doesn’t make New Hampshire safer; it doesn’t make it safer for New Hampshire police officers and it’s extremely disappointing,” he said.“The death penalty has been used sparingly, judiciously and appropriately at a time when New Hampshire’s police officers are confronted with greater and greater violence.”Cheetham said the repeal “sends a message that puts police officer’s lives in danger,” and promised that law enforcement will be following Addison’s case closely.“We’ll be tracking that case and mark my words and those of others, in the coming weeks or months we will see Michael Addison’s death sentence changed to life without the possibility of parole because of repeal of the death penalty today.”Kelly Ayotte, former U.S. Senator and the attorney general who served as chief prosecutor in the Addison trial, expressed disappointment about the state Senate vote in a tweet: “Police killer Michael Addison is the happiest about their vote today.”"

Chris Sununu was not giving up without a fight.As he did with Republican members of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Sununu was making his final appeals privately to the five GOP members who supported the death penalty repeal bill last month.But this one is an even heavier lift than the House was and even then Sununu came up just one vote short of having his veto sustained in the House.











The Senate had voted, 17-6, on April 11 to pass the repeal measure (HB 455) and Sununu could pick up one more opponent with Sen. Lou D'Allesandro, D-Manchester, who was absent for that vote last monthD'Allesandro historically has stood with law enforcement in support of the state's narrowly-defined death penalty especially since the only person awaiting that ultimate punishment, Michael Addison, was convicted of shooting to death Manchester Patrolman Michael Briggs in 2006.This still would mean Sununu had to flip two other senators to bring the override vote down lower than the minimum 16-8 margin to hand him another defeat.His chances of getting Democratic converts are truly next to nil.Sen. Kevin Cavanaugh, D-Manchester, is the only other Democrat who has supported the death penalty.His options with getting Senate GOP members to change their minds aren't much better, however.Sens. Harold French, R-Franklin, Bob Giuda, R-Warren, John Reagan, R-Deerfield, and Ruth Ward, R-Stoddard, had already voted to repeal capital punishment in 2018.This came at a time when the advocates knew they didn't have enough to overcome that Sununu veto.The only ""new"" GOP supporter for the repeal effort this year was freshman Sen. David Starr, R-Franconia.However this ends, law enforcement groups give Sununu high marks for making the extra effort despite the ideological numbers in both chambers being stacked against him.First NH special election coming upTwo-term State Rep. Sean Morrison, R-Epping, has become the first state legislator to step down from his seat which should set up a competitive special election in Rockingham County.A Hampton firefighter, Morrison announced on social media at the beginning of this week that he was stepping away.""I simply do not wish to serve as a state representative in Epping, or anywhere else any longer. It is not worth it to me or my family,"" Morrison wrote on Facebook Wednesday. ""I think I have served the country, state and town enough, and I just don’t wish to do it anymore.""I will still always help a neighbor and still be making the same posts I always have on my personal page, only LESS p/c.""Morrison could not be reached for further comment.He had told friends on Facebook that it was difficult for him to attend to the demands of serving in the House while being a full-time first responder.A military veteran, Morrison has been critical of local school administrative decisions and at times been unafraid to oppose and challenge the leadership of his own party in the House.In 2017, Morrison resigned in protest from a foster care oversight committee after concluding the panel was too closely aligned to the child protective service agency it should have been investigating.Morrison and his wife had been foster parents.Many GOP lawmakers and activists praised Morrison on social media.""Sean thanks for your service to our country and our state,"" wrote Rep. J.P. Marzullo, R-Deering. ""You have represented the veterans well and I appreciate all that you have done.""The Epping Board of Selectmen has the sole discretion to decide if it wants the seat to be filled.The local board also gets to pick just when when it wishes to officially make the request to the governor and Executive Council to set an election to fill the vacancy.Locally, former Rep. Mike Vose has told GOP sources that he's interested in running; he lost his seat last November.Another possible GOP hopeful is Cody Belanger who currently serves as an area vice chairman for the Republican State Committee.If there was a primary for this seat, party rules would require Belanger to step down from his GOP post to run.Belanger is also serving in his second year as a member of the Epping Board of Selectmen.Meanwhile Democrats aren't about to cede this set to the GOP since Mark Vallone, D-Epping, topped the ticket to win one of Epping's two seats last November.Jerry Marceau had finished fourth in 2018 and remained active in the local Democratic organizing committees since.Democrats were coming not only successful midterms elections but the off years in which they won nine of 11 special elections in 2017 and 2018 and flipped several House seats from red-to-blue.State budget fight reaches crunch timeSenate budget writers have made several moves in the past week hoping to erase the more obvious reasons why Sununu would veto a two-year budget.The Senate Finance Committee is expected to take its final votes Friday but many of the pivotal policy decisions have already been made and some should but clearly not all should be to Sununu's liking.The Senate spending plan would deliver much than the House budget did on one of his signature priorities, a secure psychiatric unit that could move mentally unstable patients off state prison grounds.The current Senate plan for $17 million and 24 beds would be smaller than Sununu's original but it also includes a new psychiatric wing for children in Nashua.Meanwhile, Sununu was most vocally outspoken in his opposition to the House budget's inclusion of a new capital gains tax that contained a generous exemption from it for low and moderate-income citizens.The Senate budget proposal sets aside that idea.This doesn't mean, however, that all is sweetness and light between the Democratically-led Senate budget writers and the GOP governor.Senate Democratic leaders have internally been pursuing several revenue proposals aimed at avoiding the need for a capital gains tax while still generating enough new money to support much spending contained in the House-passed budget.These include:— Reasonable Compensation Burden of Proof: The GOP-led Legislature in 2011 delivered a big gift to business owners by putting the onus on state tax auditors to prove someone's claim of pay and bonuses should be treated as taxable under the 7.9 percent Business Profits Tax. Prior to 2011 the burden was on the business owner to defend his compensation as non-taxable.  This plan would reverse that policy and place the onus back on business owners to proof they were entitled to that treatment.— Conformity: This would align the state's business tax structure with the 2017 federal tax cut President Trump signed which slashed the top end of the corporate tax from 35-to-21 percent but also broadened the base of business activity subject to the levy.Some accounting studies maintain this change could produce as much as $50 million more into state coffers during the second year of the next budget.  There are some business leaders who maintain that estimate is too overly optimistic and,— Single stream taxation: Many states have made this change to gives companies better tax treatment for having employees and plant equipment located in those states. They do this in the way they count sales subject to the state profits tax and how much dividends paid within New Hampshire count towards the Business Enterprise Tax.This change has a lot of business support.It passed as a separate bill on a voice vote through the Senate last March (SB 190).The House Ways and Means Committee endorsed an amended version of it Wednesday by a 19-0 vote with the change to become effective Jan. 1, 2021.The forecast for this change could be as much as $10 million a year through the Department of Revenue had yet to publicly endorse that amount.Education funding fight still rages onSununu and Democratic legislative leaders both want to make some changes to the state's education aid law but remain split over what that should look like.The House budget had made permanent changes to the education aid formula granting more money to property poor school districts and also more for districts that have larger numbers of students on the free and reduced school lunch program.Last week Senate Majority Leader Dan Feltes, D-Concord, said this Senate spending plan would include ""significant increases"" in aid to education as well as revenue sharing grants for cities and towns.For his part, Sununu has told legislative leaders privately he can support using one-time surplus money to increase state aid grants to the communities that need the most help but he has been against making permanent changes to the education aid formula.NH GOP attacks Senate tax advocate The NH GOP continued its assault on State Sen. Jeanne Dietsch, D-Peterborough, for her proposal to subject higher-income wage earners to a 6.2 percent income tax on their upper-end Social Security earnings.A GOP staffer had videotaped the public hearing on Dietsch's proposal and earlier this week made it a digital ad.“The people of Senate Dist. 9 deserve to know what their state senator is doing on their behalf in Concord. Senator Dietsch has long voted in lockstep with the Democrat party, but her latest stunt puts her further out-of-touch from those she represents,"" said GOP Chairman Stephen Stepanek.""Her attempt to implement a 6.2% income tax would destroy the New Hampshire Advantage and devastate our Granite State economy.""Last week Dietsch said her proposal was aimed at closing a loophole in the federal income tax code and by doing she would leverage more than $300 million in property tax relief.The Senate Finance Committee flatly rejected the plan.Hassan builds more support for surprise medical billsSen. Maggie Hassan, D-NH, continues to get more and more traction on her legislation to block surprise medical bills insurance companies sometimes deliver to unsuspecting consumers.President Trump brought some momentum to the cause with his own Oval Office ceremony that endorsed the campaign.Now there are 21 senators from both political parties that have signed onto this proposal first advocated by Hassan and five other senators including 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful Michael Bennet, D-Colo, who campaigned in NH on Tuesday and Wednesday this week.“I am encouraged by the significant bipartisan momentum that continues to grow for our STOP Surprise Medical Bills Act, which will help end the absurd practice of surprise medical billing that’s hurting too many families in New Hampshire and across our state,” Hassan said.“I will keep working across the aisle to move this legislation forward as quickly as possible.”Booker says tax plan would help 500K in NHWhite House Democratic hopeful Cory Booker released new analysis from the nonpartisan Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy that concludes his Rise Credit would help 498,900 in the state.Booker's plan is to double the working class families that could benefit from the Earned Income Tax Credit to making married couples making up to $90,000 a year eligible for it.The New Jersey senator maintains this would lift 15 million people out of poverty and give a tax credit to nearly half of all Americans.“It’s a common pain in our country that so many find themselves with more month at the end of their money than money at the end of the month,” Booker said.  “And yet, our current tax code has only made things worse. The rich have continued to get richer, while many New Hampshire families have to choose between affording groceries and medicine.

Chris Sununu to sign a bill that would help fund large solar arrays at businesses and municipalities across the state.Representatives from the Duprey Companies, Hypertherm and Worthen Industries were among those expressing support for a set of clean energy principles advocated by New Hampshire Businesses for Social Responsibility.“NHBSR is a network of nearly 200 businesses across the state committed to building a more sustainable and prosperous state for all,” said Michelle Veasey, executive director. “Increasingly our businesses are recognizing the role that policy plays in their ability to implement sustainability practices.”About 50 businesses signed on to the five “Clean Energy Principles” advocated by NHBSR when they were first released in 2018, with more than 100 on board as of Wednesday, according to Veasey.The principles call for investment in energy efficiency and renewable energy, and a shift away from fossil fuels.Other businesses or organizations that have signed on include Autodesk, Coca-Cola Bottling Company of Northern New England, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Health, MegaFood, Hannaford Supermarkets, Lonza Biologics, Ski New Hampshire, Timberland and Velcro Companies.The legislature is currently considering several bills that would support renewable energy development in the Granite State, including a proposal to allow larger net metering projects — solar arrays that enable owners to sell excess energy back into the grid (HB 365).“The proposal to increase the net metering project cap from 1 MW to 5 MW in HB 365 would make our electric grid more stable, reduce our reliance on imported fossil fuels, and would save New Hampshire businesses money,” according to one letter to lawmakers from several of the businesses.Some members of the NHBSR have also given their support to bills that would increase the investment of proceeds from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) into energy efficiency programs and increase access to renewable energy for low-income residents.Not all members have signed on to every piece of renewable energy legislation, but they share a common interest in the clean energy principles.Developer Steve Duprey of Concord, a prominent figure in New Hampshire Republican politics and a Republican National Committee member, was joined by Republican state Sen. Jeb Bradley as presenters at the event.“I think this issue is one on which there is lots of common ground between parties and people of different philosophies. I can tell you in our own businesses, major investments in clean and renewable energy have paid us huge dividends,” said Duprey.Duprey’s properties include the Concord Comfort Inn and Grappone Conference Center as well as multiple business and residential buildings.“There are lots of great policy debates, but we are honored to sign on to these principles and will continue our company’s effort to invest heavily in this area. It makes a difference,” he said.“At the end of the day, we can say we left New Hampshire a better, cleaner place, which is a pretty good legacy for all of us.”"
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,"Kevin Landrigan's Granite Status: Death penalty showdown, state budget fight still looms","May 29, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/politics/granite_status/kevin-landrigan-s-granite-status-death-penalty-showdown-state-budget/article_3882d790-79b6-51ea-a3c9-b44480df9fd0.html,"The New Hampshire state Senate looked ready to make history and repeal the state’s death penalty Thursday but on the eve of the vote, two-term Gov. Chris Sununu was not giving up without a fight.As he did with Republican members of the New Hampshire House of Representatives, Sununu was making his final appeals privately to the five GOP members who supported the death penalty repeal bill last month.But this one is an even heavier lift than the House was, and even then Sununu came up one vote short of having his veto sustained in the House.The Senate voted 17-6 on April 11 to pass the repeal measure (HB 455). Sununu could pick up one more opponent with Sen. Lou D’Allesandro, D-Manchester, who was absent for that vote.D’Allesandro historically has stood with law enforcement in support of the state’s narrowly defined death penalty, especially since the only person awaiting that ultimate punishment, Michael Addison, was convicted of shooting to death Manchester Patrolman Michael Briggs in 2009.This still would mean Sununu had to flip two other senators to bring the override vote down lower than the minimum 16-8 margin required to hand him another defeat.His chances of getting Democratic converts are truly next to nil.Sen. Kevin Cavanaugh, D-Manchester, is the only other Democrat who has supported the death penalty.Sununu’s odds on getting Senate GOP members to change their minds aren’t much better, however.Sens. Harold French, R-Franklin, Bob Giuda, R-Warren, John Reagan, R-Deerfield, and Ruth Ward, R-Stoddard, had already voted to repeal capital punishment in 2018. This came at a time when the advocates knew they didn’t have enough votes to overcome that Sununu veto.The only “new” GOP supporter for the repeal effort this year was freshman Sen. David Starr, R-Franconia.However this ends, law enforcement groups give Sununu high marks for making the extra effort, despite the ideological numbers in both chambers being stacked against him.First NH special election coming upTwo-term state Rep. Sean Morrison, R-Epping, has become the first state legislator to step down from his seat, which should set up a competitive special election in Rockingham County.A Hampton firefighter, Morrison announced on social media at the beginning of this week that he was stepping away.“I simply do not wish to serve as a state representative in Epping, or anywhere else any longer. It is not worth it to me or my family,” Morrison wrote on Facebook Wednesday. “I think I have served the country, state and town enough, and I just don’t wish to do it anymore.“I will still always help a neighbor and still be making the same posts I always have on my personal page, only LESS p/c.”Morrison could not be reached for further comment.He had told friends on Facebook that it was difficult for him to attend to the demands of serving in the House while being a full-time first responder.A military veteran, Morrison has been critical of local school administrative decisions and at times been unafraid to oppose and challenge the leadership of his own party in the House.In 2017, Morrison resigned in protest from a foster care oversight committee after concluding the panel was too closely aligned to the child protective service agency it should have been investigating.Morrison and his wife had been foster parents.Many GOP lawmakers and activists praised Morrison on social media.“Sean thanks for your service to our country and our state,” wrote Rep. J.P. Marzullo, R-Deering. “You have represented the veterans well and I appreciate all that you have done.”The Epping Board of Selectmen has the sole discretion to decide if it wants the seat to be filled.The local board also gets to pick just when when it wishes to officially make the request to the governor and Executive Council to set an election to fill the vacancy.Locally, former Rep. Mike Vose has told GOP sources that he’s interested in running; he lost his seat last November.Another possible GOP hopeful is Cody Belanger, who currently serves as an area vice chairman for the Republican State Committee.If there was a primary for this seat, party rules would require Belanger to step down from his GOP post to run.Meanwhile Democrats aren’t about to cede this set to the GOP, since Mark Vallone, D-Epping, topped the ticket to win one of Epping’s two seats last November.Jerry Marceau finished fourth in 2018 and remained active in the local Democratic organizing committees since.State budget fight reaches crunch timeSenate budget writers have made several moves in the past week hoping to erase the more obvious reasons why Sununu would veto a two-year budget.The Senate Finance Committee is expected to take its final votes Friday but many of the pivotal policy decisions have already been made and some but clearly not all should be to Sununu’s liking.The Senate spending plan would deliver much more than the House budget did on one of his signature priorities, a secure psychiatric unit that could move mentally unstable patients off state prison grounds.The current Senate plan for $17 million and 24 beds would be smaller than Sununu’s original, but it also includes a new psychiatric wing for children in Nashua.Meanwhile, Sununu was most vocally outspoken in his opposition to the House budget’s inclusion of a new capital gains tax that contained a generous exemption for low- and moderate-income citizens.The Senate budget proposal sets aside that idea.This doesn’t mean, however, that all is sweetness and light between the Democratically led Senate budget writers and the GOP governor.Senate Democratic leaders have internally been pursuing several revenue proposals aimed at avoiding the need for a capital gains tax while still generating enough new money to support much of the spending contained in the House-passed budget.These include:Reasonable compensation burden of proof: The GOP-led Legislature in 2011 delivered a big gift to business owners by putting the onus on state tax auditors to prove someone’s claim of pay and bonuses should be treated as taxable under the 7.9 percent Business Profits Tax. Prior to 2011 the burden was on the business owner to defend his compensation as non-taxable. This plan would reverse that policy and place the onus back on business owners to prove they were entitled to that treatment.Conformity: This would align the state’s business tax structure with the 2017 federal tax cut that President Trump signed. It slashed the top end of the corporate tax from 35 to 21 percent, but also broadened the base of business activity subject to the levy.Some accounting studies maintain this change could bring as much as $50 million more into state coffers during the second year of the next budget. There are some business leaders who maintain that estimate is overly optimistic.Single-stream taxation: Many states have made this change to gives companies better tax treatment for having employees and plant equipment located in those states. They do this in the way they count sales subject to the state profits tax, and how much dividends paid within New Hampshire count toward the Business Enterprise Tax. This change has a lot of business support.It passed as a separate bill on a voice vote through the Senate last March (SB 190).For more Granite Status, go to Union Leader.com.The House Ways and Means Committee endorsed an amended version of it Wednesday by a 19-0 vote, with the change to become effective Jan. 1, 2021.The forecast for this change could be as much as $10 million a year, though the Department of Revenue has yet to publicly endorse that amount.Education funding fight rages onSununu and Democratic legislative leaders both want to make some changes to the state’s education aid law, but remain split over what that should look like.The House budget had made permanent changes to the education aid formula, granting more money to property-poor school districts and also more for districts that have larger numbers of students on the free and reduced-price school lunch program.Last week Senate Majority Leader Dan Feltes, D-Concord, said the Senate spending plan would include “significant increases” in aid to education as well as revenue-sharing grants for cities and towns.For his part, Sununu has told legislative leaders privately he can support using one-time surplus money to increase state aid grants to the communities that need the most help, but he has been against making permanent changes to the education aid formula.NH GOP attacks Senate tax advocate The NH GOP continued its assault on state Sen.Jeanne Dietsch, D-Peterborough, for her proposal to subject higher-income wage earners to a 6.2 percent income tax on their upper-end Social Security earnings.A GOP staffer had videotaped the public hearing on Dietsch’s proposal and earlier this week made it a digital ad.”The people of Senate District 9 deserve to know what their state senator is doing on their behalf in Concord. Senator Dietsch has long voted in lockstep with the Democrat party, but her latest stunt puts her further out of touch from those she represents,” said GOP Chairman Stephen Stepanek.”Her attempt to implement a 6.2% income tax would destroy the New Hampshire Advantage and devastate our Granite State economy.”Last week Dietsch said her proposal was aimed at closing a loophole in the federal income tax code and would leverage more than $300 million in property tax relief.The Senate Finance Committee flatly rejected the plan.Hassan builds support to stop surprise medical billsSen.Maggie Hassan, D-NH, continues to get more and more traction on her legislation to block surprise medical bills that insurance companies sometimes deliver to unsuspecting consumers.President Trump brought some momentum to the cause with his own Oval Office ceremony that endorsed the campaign.Now there are 21 senators from both political parties who have signed onto the proposal first advocated by Hassan and five other senators, including 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful Michael Bennet, D-Colo. Bennet campaigned in New Hampshire on Tuesday and Wednesday this week.”I am encouraged by the significant bipartisan momentum that continues to grow for our STOP Surprise Medical Bills Act, which will help end the absurd practice of surprise medical billing that’s hurting too many families in New Hampshire and across our state,” Hassan said.”I will keep working across the aisle to move this legislation forward as quickly as possible.”Booker says tax plan would help 498,900 in NHWhite House Democratic hopefulCory Bookerreleased new analysis from the nonpartisan Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy that concludes his Rise Credit would help 498,900 in the state.Booker’s plan is to double the number of working-class families who could benefit from the Earned Income Tax Credit, with married couples making up to $90,000 a year eligible for it.The New Jersey senator maintains this would lift 15 million people out of poverty and give a tax credit to nearly half of all Americans.”It’s a common pain in our country that so many find themselves with more month at the end of their money than money at the end of the month,” Booker said. “And yet, our current tax code has only made things worse. The rich have continued to get richer, while many New Hampshire families have to choose between affording groceries and medicine. The Rise Credit counters that injustice, putting money in the pockets of hard-working Granite Staters struggling to get ahead.”klandrigan@unionleader.com"
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,"NH sues 3M, DuPont, 6 other companies over PFAS contamination","May 29, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/courts/nh-sues-m-dupont-other-companies-over-pfas-contamination/article_71956ea1-4a2a-5821-b737-2c44312e83d1.html,"CONCORD — The state of New Hampshire is taking some of the biggest chemical companies in the world to court, seeking hundreds of millions of dollars to clean up groundwater and other forms of contamination from a group of highly toxic chemicals used in everything from firefighting foam to Teflon pans.Gov. Chris Sununu and Attorney General Gordon MacDonald on Wednesday announced lawsuits against the companies, all of which are involved in the manufacture and distribution of chemicals known as PFAS (polyfluroalkyl substances)Two lawsuits have been filed in Hillsborough County Superior Court North against 3M, DuPont, the Chemours Company, Chemguard, Tyco Fire Products, Buckeye Fire Equipment, Kidde-Fenwal and National Foam, Inc.Three of the companies are named in both lawsuits — 3M, DuPont and Chemours, a spin-off from DuPont. The suits allege that despite their unique knowledge of the dangers of these chemicals, the companies continued to make and sell them without warning the public of their health risks.The lawsuits seek damages for contamination of the state’s natural resources and will seek to recover costs related to the investigation, cleanup and other forms of response to contamination.MacDonald said the scope of the lawsuit and the relief the state is seeking could match or exceed the $236 million jury verdict awarded the state in 2013 in a lawsuit against Exxonmobile for groundwater contamination caused by the gasoline additive MTBE.By the time appeals were exhausted, the principle and interest owed the state had grown to $300 million.Most of that money went into a dedicated drinking water and groundwater trust fund to pay for remediation projects across the state.As with that case, the state will be using outside attorneys with expertise in lawsuits against major corporations over environmental contamination.‘Most significant’Sununu described the action as one of the most significant lawsuits the state has ever undertaken.“We are confident this lawsuit will be a success and that it will provide proper assistance to the state and our communities,” said Sununu. “And as we move forward with this lawsuit we will continue to investigate strengthening our state’s drinking water standards, which have yet to be finalized.”The state Department of Environmental Services is currently reviewing proposals to lower the acceptable level of PFAS in New Hampshire water supplies, as a result a bill sponsored by former state Rep. Mindi Messmer of Rye.“We are only beginning to understand the magnitude and scope of this contamination in our beautiful state,” Messmer said.“While this (lawsuit) is a step in the right direction, we must not get distracted from the immediate need to protect our citizens from unsafe drinking water by continuing to identify sources and continuing to push for stricter, enforceable drinking water standards.”According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), New Hampshire has the highest rates of breast, bladder, esophageal and pediatric cancer in the nation.PFAS contamination has been found in groundwater supplies in several communities throughout the state, including Portsmouth, Bedford, Merrimack and Manchester.There is no dollar amount cited in the lawsuits, which could stretch on for years. The Exxonmobile case, first filed in 2003, took 10 years to come to trial.“We are among the first, if not the first, in bringing these actions,” said MacDonald.‘Forever chemicals’PFAS is short for perfluoroalky and polyfluoroalkyl substances and includes chemicals known as PFOS and PFOA.They are called “forever chemicals” because they never fully break down, according to the Conservation Law Foundation.PFAS has been widely used in nonstick cookware, food wrappers, water-repellent clothing, stain-resistant fabrics and carpets, some cosmetics, some firefighting foams, and products that resist grease, water, and oil.State environmental officials have identified PFAS contamination at the former Pease Air Force Base in Portsmouth, the Coakley Landfill in North Hampton and near industrial sites in Bedford, Merrimack, Manchester, Stratham, Kingston, East Kingston and BrentwoodMore than 750 properties in southern New Hampshire have been transferred from private wells to public water at great expense, with more than 100,000 people statewide affected by some form of PFAS contamination, according to DES estimates.“That’s not to say overall that the drinking water of New Hampshire is not safe,” said Sununu. “We’re moving this (lawsuit) forward for the treatment we provide for these water systems, ensuring that every time you turn on the faucet that you can confidently hand a glass of water to your kids.”Representatives for DuPont and 3M said they would fight the lawsuit aggressively.“While we do not comment on pending litigation, we will vigorously defend our record of safety, health and environmental stewardship,” said Dan Turner, with DuPont corporate communications.Fanna Haile-Selassie, external communications manager with 3M, said” “3M cares deeply about the safety and health of New Hampshire’s communities. 3M acted responsibly in connection with products containing PFAS and will vigorously defend its environmental stewardship.”dsolomon@unionleader.com"
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,NH House endorses anti-discrimination bill for public school students,"May 28, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/education/nh-house-endorses-anti-discrimination-bill-for-public-school-students/article_7312135c-687d-58e5-b3fd-482255fd4fd0.html,"CONCORD — A House committee on Tuesday voted to endorse a Senate bill establishing anti-discrimination protections for students in public schools despite warnings about the potential impact on interscholastic sports by transgender students, particularly students born as males participating in female sports.An amendment to the bill, developed in cooperation with the governor’s office, failed in a 13-6 vote of the House Judiciary Committee, after which the bill was recommended for passage in a 13-6 vote, mostly along party lines.The bill (SB 263) amends state education law to state that, “no person shall be subjected to discrimination in public schools” on the basis of age, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, race and all other attributes protected by existing civil rights statutes. Gov. Chris Sununu last year signed a bill adding gender identity to that list.Extending civil rights protections to public school students was the first recommendation of the Governor’s Advisory Council of Diversity and Inclusion, established by Sununu in 2017 after an incident in Claremont described as the attempted lynching of a young boy.Allegations of racist behavior at UNH also played into the council’s creation. More than 100 incidents of reported bias at the state university in 2016 included the vandalizing of school property with racial slurs and swastikas.The bill passed the Senate, 20-3, on March 28, and was referred to the House Education Committee. The full House passed the bill, 214-143, on May 8, and referred it to the Judiciary Committee for another review, setting the stage for Tuesday’s vote.The bill now heads back to the House, which is expected to pass it again when it next meets on June 5 or 6.Sununu generally supports the bill but has expressed concerns about unintended consequences, and said he hopes they can be addressed in committee. His legal counsel, attorney John Formella, worked with lawmakers on the Education and Judiciary committees to craft language addressing those concerns.The amendment supported by Sununu adds a statement that requires public schools to develop policies that prevent discrimination, while at the same time “maintaining fair play for all in extracurricular activities.”“I believe this addresses some of the concerns that were raised in the floor debate,” said Rep. Joe Alexander, R-Goffstown, a co-author of the amendment.Rep. Timothy Horrigan, D-Durham, argued that the amendment was unnecessary because the New Hampshire Interscholastic Athletic Association already has rules that enable students to play on teams that align with their gender identity.“The thing that has made this bill most controversial is something we would not be able to do anything useful about,” he said. “The NHIAA is aware of the issue of who can participate in which sports, and they have what seems like a reasonable policy to me.”Rep. Rick Ladd, R-Haverhill, ranking Republican on the Education Committee, said the legislation should more precisely establish the legal standard by which schools will be judged for alleged failures to protect students against discrimination.“What is the legal standard here?” he said, “Is it negligence or deliberate indifference? There is nothing in there to give support to the courts in making that decision.”Despite those reservations, a majority of the committee agreed it was best to move the legislation along, and not hold it back for further study or additional amendments.“The Advisory Council of Diversity and Inclusion was established in December 2017, almost a year and a half ago, as a result of incidents that took place in 2016 and 17,” said Rep. Sandra Keans, D-Rochester.“Six months to a year is a long time in the life of a child, and we are now working on three to four years if we wait until next January to come back with something. The appropriate action is to pass this, get a committee of conference (with the Senate) and work out the details. This has gone on too long for children who have had adverse incidents.”dsolomon@unionleader.com"

Chris Sununu’s announcement recently that he will again run for governor, this state employee is not excited, nor happy that Gov. Sununu thinks he is doing such a good job that he deserves another term.While he says over and over again how well the economy in New Hampshire is doing, he fails to see the critical role state employees’ play in that success. He needs to give us a fair contract without concessions to make it clear that he values our work.Our contract expires on June 30 and once again heading into arbitration to obtain a new contract when all the governor and his team needed to do was negotiate a fair one. While the governor likes to tout that state employees received raises with the last contract, he fails to mention that we received well below the 6% raise the arbitrator said state employees deserved.The proof of how much Gov. Sununu values state employees is in the contract. He and his team failed to negotiate one without concessions that speaks volumes. State employees work diligently each day to do the work of the state in ways that are efficient and effective, and for this we deserve a fair contract.I myself will not be voting for reelection of Gov. Sununu because of his record of treatment of state employees. I encourage all fellow state employees, current and past, to band together and be more vocal about what we deserve in a fair contract.PAMELA MACKWebster"
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,Dave Solomon's State House Dome: Signing dispute holds up DCYF bill,"May 25, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/politics/statehouse_dome/dave-solomon-s-state-house-dome-signing-dispute-holds-up/article_cc18b2bf-9f46-5cd6-b4c4-cc53cf9f72a4.html,"Republican Gov. Chris Sununu and Democratic leaders in the state Legislature celebrated a significant bipartisan accomplishment on Tuesday in a ceremonial signing of Senate Bill 11 at the offices of the New Hampshire Alliance on Mental Illness.











The bill provides funding to address one of the state’s most pressing problems— the boarding of mental health patients in hospital emergency rooms due to a lack of in-patient mental health beds. It passed the Senate unanimously and the House of Representatives with a strong voice vote and was quickly signed into law.At the ceremonial signing for the $7.5 million legislation, Sununu was surrounded by Democratic and Republican lawmakers, all smiling broadly in a rare show of solidarity.The governor and Legislature have also agreed on a bill (SB 6) to address another seemingly intractable problem — adequate staffing at the Division for Children, Youth and Families to cope with burgeoning reports of child abuse.But efforts to stage a ceremonial signing for SB 6 that would match the collaborative spirit of SB 11 devolved into the kind of partisan sniping to which we’ve become more accustomed.Sununu wanted an event Friday morning at the renovated Department of Health and Human Services offices in Conway, but the prime sponsor of the bill, Democratic Sen. Jon Morgan, was unavailable.“When I explained Friday morning in Conway was not workable, yet we could be otherwise flexible, they literally dismissed me out-of-hand and told me that was the one and only time to sign this bill,” Morgan said.“That’s why I asked the Senate President to hold the bill until we can work with the governor’s office to find a time and location that works for everyone.”In a letter delivered Friday to Senate President Donna Soucy and House Speaker Steve Shurtleff, Sununu expressed his frustration.“This morning I visited the newly re-opened Conway DHHS District Office. I witnessed firsthand the incredible work our DCYF employees do on a daily basis,” Sununu wrote.“I was disappointed, however, that the visit to Conway did not include a bill signing for Senate Bill 6. Our hardworking DCYF employees — especially those in field offices across the state — are on the front lines, need our support and deserved this recognition. … Unfortunately, you have decided to hold on to the bill for more than 20 days.”The legislation passed the Senate, 23-0, in February and cleared the House, 272-87, on May 2.It funds 77 new positions — 57 child protective service workers (CPSW) and 20 supervisors — in the Division for Children, Youth and Families over two years at a cost of $8.6 million.Sununu’s version of the state budget authorized 62 new DCYF positions but paid for only 26. In the end, he agreed to the numbers proposed by Democrats in SB 6.“Today’s letter is nothing but a political gimmick; if the governor was serious about protecting children’s safety he would have fully funded DCYF in his budget proposal in the first place,” Morgan said. “The signing of this bill is about far more than a media opportunity that the governor is so intent on.”The bill takes effect immediately upon Sununu’s signature, and he encouraged lawmakers to get it to his desk so the money can get into the pipeline.“I’m always willing to work with the governor’s office and we tried to, but in this case they refused to coordinate,” Soucy said.“I remain willing and ready to plan a time when the prime sponsor, governor and advocates can gather to sign this important bill and recognize New Hampshire’s continued progress on children’s safety and well-being. As co-equal branches of government, it is important we all get the opportunity to celebrate the signing of SB 6 together.”A bill signing is likely to occur at some point in the near future, but where it happens, when it happens and who gets to attend is still being negotiated.dsolomon@unionleader.com"
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,Charities want 'historic horse racing' machines at NH casinos,"May 25, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/politics/state/charities-want-historic-horse-racing-machines-at-nh-casinos/article_af744eef-dd59-5e5a-bb5b-a3e9611609c3.html,"CONCORD — Another ill-fated casino bill and the governor’s call for legal sports betting have occupied most of the State House spotlight on gambling this year, but a bill that would allow what critics call cleverly disguised slot machines is quietly working its way through the Legislature.SB 41 would allow historical racing machines, electronic gambling kiosks that enable players to bet on horse races that have already been run.The bill would authorize installation of the machines in the 14 charitable gaming locations throughout the state, such as the River Casino and Sports Bar in Nashua, which are required under state law to give 35% of their gross profits to registered charities.The charities rely heavily on gambling revenue, and are worried about the opening of the new Wynn Encore resort in Everett, Mass., scheduled for June 23.“When Wynn opens with full-blown electronic gaming and unlimited bets, it’s going to have an impact on charitable gaming facilities in New Hampshire,” says Sen. Harold French, R-Franklin, chief sponsor of SB 41.His district includes Belmont, which hosts the Lakes Region Casino at the site of the former greyhound racing track.New Hampshire’s charitable casinos offer table games with a $10 maximum bet, but are anxious to see electronic gambling, which has the potential to attract an entirely new clientele.No one opposed the bill at its Senate public hearing in January, and it passed the Senate on a voice vote in March.The House Ways and Means Committee has had the bill since then and is scheduled to vote its recommendation on Tuesday, with a full House vote likely the first week of June.Opposition mobilizedGov. Chris Sununu supports the bill but the opposition has finally begun to mobilize, and the outcome of Tuesday’s committee vote is uncertain. A similar bill filed by French last year got out of the Senate but stalled in the House.“I don’t know how the vote is going to go on Tuesday,” said Rep. Susan Almy, D-Lebanon, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. “Two subcommittees did not reach any kind of decisions because no one really understands these machines. A couple of us saw a model in a hotel room and it became apparent to us that these are very close to a slot machine.”Lobbyist Rick Newman with New Hampshire Government Solutions has represented the charitable casinos and the manufacturer of the gambling machines in the legislative process so far. He disputes the description of them as slot machines.“They are slow, and don’t work off a random number generator,” he said. “They don’t attract everyone who would play slots. What they do is give us an electronic game option that we don’t have and the charities need to compete with the Oxford Casino (in Maine) and Encore, starting next month.”Newman admits the machines are “similar to slot machines” but with significant differences.“They play races so you can actually watch the race,” he said. “They give you all the stats for the horses, and unlike slot machines, they are set to pay off a certain amount. If you choose the right horse, you win, and you can win 1,000 times in a row, unlike a slot machine, which pays off at a certain percentage.”Game of skill?To the uninitiated, however, the historical racing machines look and sound like slot machines, except that a brief video of a horse race plays in a tiny box in the corner of the screen, which displays the same symbols and “reels” of a Vegas slot.The horse race is randomly generated from a database of nearly 100,000 races. The machines have a “handicapping” feature that allows them to be marketed as skill-based gaming, and players can look at stats before placing their bets.Most players don’t use the handicapping option, however, and instead use the “auto-cap” feature, which requires no skill or attention to horse racing.“This is a back door to get video slot machines legalized in New Hampshire,” said Jim Reubens, former chairman of the Granite State Coalition Against Expanded Gambling. “The play is rapid and addictive, with no skill required.”“Once you open the door to a certain type of gambling, it’s almost impossible to close it, and very difficult to oppose expansion,” he said.Newman points out that the same committee examining SB 41 has already endorsed sports betting with no limits of any kind, and no revenue to the state.“Historic horse racing can generate $8 million in revenue for the state, $4 million for charities and 100 to 300 new jobs,” he said.Getting emailsAlmy says opposition to the bill had been muted, until the latest casino bill proposed by Sen.

Lobbyists from the firm Preti Flaherty registered this month as representing Churchill Downs, the parent company of Oxford Casino.“Oxford Casino does a lot of advertising in New Hampshire, and a significant amount of their business comes from here,” said Newman. “They know some of that is at risk if charity gaming grows in New Hampshire.”dsolomon@unionleader.com"

Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,Elusive animal cruelty reform nears home stretch,"May 25, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/animals/elusive-animal-cruelty-reform-nears-home-stretch/article_ac071418-7510-5552-a608-c90e479948d3.html,"CONCORD — A bitter, two-year fight at the State House over reforming the state’s animal cruelty laws in the wake of expensive, high-profile abuse cases could be headed for a compromise, according to legislative leaders.House and Senate Democratic and Republican lawmakers were anxious not to declare premature victory over the issue that at times had advocates for humane animal care and kennel owners at loggerheads.“I don’t want to jinx this,” said State Rep. Peter Bixby, D-Dover, vice chairman of the House Environment and Agriculture Committee who’s been one of the issue’s leading brokers.“There’s still some final language to work out but I think what we have come up with is a bill that is balanced and covers the bases very well.”Sen. Jeb Bradley, R-Wolfeboro, was the prime architect of 2018 legislation to bring more breeders under state purview and to crack down on animal abusers in a variety of ways.The rallying cry was the nationally publicized case of Christina Fay, convicted on animal cruelty charges and ordered to pay nearly $2 million in restitution after more than 80 Great Danes were removed from her Wolfeboro home in 2017.But Bradley’s ambitious proposal in 2018 crashed and burned in the House of Representatives as breeders turned out in force to charge that it gave state regulators too much power and subjected small breeding operations to onerous oversight.Bradley returned this year with a measured approach with the goal of speeding up animal abuse cases in court while offering more specific legal protections for the accused.Once again, however, Bradley’s 2019 bill stalled, this time after the House membership soundly rejected House leaders who wanted to earmark 50 cents from every dog license for a fund that would pay for the cost of care for animals confiscated due to allegations of animal cruelty.The New Hampshire Municipal Association opposed it as a new state mandate that should be paid for through a new fee and not from dog licensing money that cities and towns collected.In turn, Gov. Chris Sununu vowed to veto any addition to dog licenses for this purpose because he considered it to be a “new tax.”“We were kind of boxed in on both sides from folks who didn’t want any of the licensing money now used for this and those who were totally against a new fee. So it went nowhere,” said Rep. Howard Pearl, R-Loudon, who has also worked on the issue.“We have not wanted a repeat of last year’s collapse so all the stakeholders have kept talking.”Last Thursday night, Bradley offered in the Senate a bill he said contained provisions that advocates of both camps would embrace.“These are all, in my opinion, reasonable compromises that hopefully can go back to the House and find support,” Bradley said before the Senate adopted them on a voice vote.“Finally we will get a chance to do the right thing.”The Senate attached the plan to a House-passed bill (HB 459) directing lawmakers to come up with guidelines for harvesting hemp that would not run afoul of the federal ban on growing marijuana.Bixby was the prime author of the hemp bill that has strong bipartisan support in the House.The latest compromise drops the cost of the care fund idea, as it was already contained in another bill that the House committee will study this fall.Some provisions of the emerging plan include:Requiring a court hearing within 14 days of animals being confiscated for alleged crueltyPreventing animal owners convicted of felony cruelty from ownership of animals for at least five yearsPermitting a co-owner to seek temporary custody of animals during court proceedings if there’s no evidence that that individual was involved in the abuseRequiring the transfers of all dogs, cats and ferrets to come with a recent health certificate signed by a veterinarianReturning animals and the full restitution of ordered fines or costs of care to any accused abuser judged to be innocent of the crime“I think what is important is that we wanted to make sure we had a bill that really did provide law enforcement and the court with the tools they need to deal with people who really are offending,” Bixby said. “We also wanted to make sure that defendants have due process rights and those are protected.”The House will likely ask for a conference committee of House and Senate negotiators to hammer out the final language, Bixby said.klandrigan@unionleader.com"

Albert Pinard was 44 when he was killed while collecting trash for the city of Manchester in 1977.

Pinard was 44 when he was riding on the back of a Manchester trash truck in 1977. Back then, Highway Department trucks did double duty — trash collection and snow plowing — and so their front ends were fitted with heavy frames to carry a snow plow. Descending the steep hill on outer South Elm Street, the truck hit a dip in the road, the front end hit the pavement and the truck slammed to a stop.Pinard was catapulted off the back and landed on his head. He died within a few hours at the old Sacred Heart Hospital, never regaining consciousness.He left a family of four children. The oldest had just graduated high school; the youngest was 8.Daughter Monica Walton, who is now 57, was 16 at the time. She remembers getting the call at Memorial High School and an anguished wait for a ride home.Pinard was a devoted father who took his kids fishing and on a rugged week-long camping trip every summer in the White Mountains, Walton said. On Sunday mornings, he walked his kids to early Mass at the old St. Theresa’s Church and then treated them to breakfast.The family had a single car — a station wagon — and owned a house on Flint Street.Back then, a guy could work at the city Highway Department and his wife could work part-time, and a couple could get by and raise four children.“It affected all of us,” Walton said of her father’s death. “He missed a lot of our lives, but we were thankful for the life we had with him.”USA Today reports that refuse collection is the fifth most dangerous job in America, based on fatality reports compiled by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Other public works related jobs — trucking, construction and grounds work — are in the top 15.Police work, which earns all sorts of plaudits for the sacrifice and dangerous work of officers, ranks 18th.“You’re out there in the elements, you’re behind a truck, you’re at the mercy of drivers,” said Bob Neveu, solid waste superintendent for the city of Manchester. Neveu is Pinard’s nephew. He credits Pinard with convincing him to apply to the city. He retires in July after a 46-year career.A memorial at the city Highway Department, erected in 2012, lists the names of 12 Manchester public works employees who died on the job.Gov. Chris Sununu and the Executive Council are expected to be on hand for the dedication of the memorial, which includes a garden of flowering perennials, a brick walkway and a row of 24 shovels, to signify the on-call nature of the job.Ten years in the making, the $300,000 memorial was funded through monetary and in-kind donations from local public works departments, employees, road-building companies and design consultants.Neveu said Pinard was a big guy, about 6 feet tall with hands the size of hams.He was proud of his work for the city. And trash seemed to be part of Pinard’s DNA. While he was working at the city landfill and refuse collection, his brother Edward was starting Pinard Waste Systems, which today bills itself as the largest independently owned solid waste collection and disposal company in New Hampshire.Pinard had started like everyone back then, “throwing cans” as they call it at the highway yard. When the opportunity arose, he moved up to be a laborer at the city landfill, and then the cherished job of truck driver.Truck drivers got overtime by plowing snow. And the job is easier; a driver can sit in the cab driving while the new hires are outside throwing trash.But Pinard realized that the refuse collectors needed experience driving trucks, so — like other drivers — he would give them a turn at the wheel and take his turn throwing cans, Neveu said.And that meant jumping on the foothold at the back of the truck and riding to the next stop. That’s what he was doing when the accident happened.The Highway Department’s solid waste division shut down for his funeral, and his fellow refuse collectors formed an honor guard outside the church.Ned Desrosiers, the superintendent of sewers for the city, also worked alongside Pinard.“He was a gentle giant,” said Desrosiers, who will be retiring soon, like Neveu. Pinard also knew how to enjoy his work.“To be blunt and honest, we’d share a beer in the cab once in awhile,” Desrosiers said. “He was a good man.”"

Chris Sununu, who has said he will sign it.The increase, effective July 1, would only to go to state, county and local retirees who finished their government service at least five years ago.The COLA would be capped at a $50,000 pension, meaning no retiree would get more than $750 per year from it.Senate Majority Leader Dan Feltes, D-Concord, said the state’s unfunded pension liability remains high but the system has stabilized and can well afford this modest increase.“In my district, 2,400 retirees including people who have worked their entire life, dedicated public servants struggling with food, medicine, heat and rent and we can’t finally go forward with an actual COLA,” Feltes said.“It’s been too long.”Sen. Jeb Bradley, R-Wolfeboro, pointed out lawmakers approved one-time $500 stipends for retirees in 2011, 2013 and 2018, but a permanent COLA would increase local property taxes by nearly $150 million over the next 20 years.The COLA would raise state taxpayer costs by more than $40 million over the same period.“You can’t on the one hand promise property tax relief and then on the other vote for a plan to raise them by $150 million,” Bradley said.Senate Republicans had again proposed Thursday a one-time, $500 stipend but that failed on the same, 12-11 vote.The Senate GOP plan would have paid the stipend with $7 million in state dollars and only grant it to those making up to a $40,000-a-year pension.Sen. Jeanne Dietsch, D-Peterborough, broke ranks with the other Senate Democrats and she opposed the COLA and backed the one-time stipend.She said the state retirement system could not estimate the impact of this increase on local property taxes in her district towns.“I can’t go back to my towns ... I can’t go back to the taxpayers that I promised I would lower your property taxes and vote to raise your property taxpayers,” Dietsch said.The New Hampshire Retirement Security Coalition said in a statement studies have shown 80 percent of the economic benefit from this COLA would remain in NH.Sen. Harold French, R-Franklin, said most of the retirees in his district have lower pensions and would get more from a one-time, $500 stipend than a 1.5 percent increase.But Sen. Kevin Cavanaugh, D-Manchester, said it’s time retirees get an increase they can depend on year after year.“They want the COLA because they can depend on it,” Cavanaugh added.klandrigan@unionleader.com"

Jeb Bradley, R-Wolfeboro, said this measure would allow the plants to reopen, save those jobs and hundreds more in the logging industry that supply wood to them.“Without this new legislation, biomass plants would be forced to close and workers across the state would lose their jobs. The biomass industry protects the health of the forests while preserving open space for ATV and snowmobile riders to take advantage of our vast trail system,” Bradley said.“It is critical that we keep the biomass plants open and our timber industry thriving to provide a diverse energy market with stable rates for years to come.”"

Marjorie Smith, D-Durham.“This is not about Democrats, Republicans, conservatives or liberals, this is about the people,” Levesque said.After the vote, Smith said she was optimistic the House would support the changes.The Senate-passed measure streamlines the selection of members and makes clear the Legislature has the final authority to approve or reject any commission redistricting plans.Any person could then appeal the inaction of the Legislature to the Supreme Court and ask the judicial branch to approve redistricting plans.The high court did just that when the GOP-led Legislature and Democratic Gov. John Lynch did not reach agreement after the 2010 elections.Sen. Jeb Bradley, R-Wolfeboro, credited Sen. James Gray, R-Rochester, and others for working with Levesque and Smith to find common ground.“It’s amazing; we’ve come up with something that is an agreeable agreement,” Bradley said. “We’ll see where this goes in the process but this is quite an accomplishment.”"

Chris Sununu is the key to restoring stabilization grants, Cascadden urged audience members to call him, giving out his office number.If Sununu doesn’t act, Cascadden said Berlin should join five other school districts in suing the state.One resident said he and his wife decided to stay in Berlin because the city “has great people,” but now with deep cuts — 6.5 percent across the board for all departments – “it’s getting tough.”State Rep. Larry Laflamme, D-Berlin, said the restoration of stabilization grants has “tremendous bipartisan support” in the Legislature, adding he was confident “they’ll be restored.”Wearing, like dozens of other people at the hearing, a T-shirt that read Save Our Schools, Nicole Plourde, the chair of the Berlin School Board, said morale has “never been lower” and like Cascadden, she recommended that people call Sununu to voice a complaint about school funding.In all, about a dozen residents spoke at the hearing, with several saying they supported raising taxes – slightly — if it meant preventing layoffs.Denise Valerino, whose husband Brian, is the Coos County Sheriff, said she knew first-hand what emergency responders go through, which is why she had “no issue” with taxes being raised so as to properly fund them. Keep services “the way they are all the way around,” she said.Mayor Paul Grenier summed up that the budget “wasn’t cast in stone” and that it has “a lot of moving parts.”As a grandfather whose grandchild attends Berlin public schools and as someone who personally knows the two city firefighters who would lose their jobs under the proposed budget, Grenier said, “I get it.“We’re going to make this work,” he said.Correction: The wife of Coos County Sheriff Brian Valerino was misidentified in a previous version of this article."

Chris Sununu, where it faces a likely veto.In a party-line vote, 215-138, the House on Thursday passed SB 67, which effectively nullifies a bill passed last year (HB 1264).HB 1264, signed into law by Sununu after a state Supreme Court advisory opinion as to its constitutionality, requires students and other transients to pay New Hampshire motor vehicle licensing and registration fees if they vote here.If SB 67 becomes law, it would restore the residency statute to wording that existed prior to 2018, making it more likely that out-of-state college students would choose to vote in New Hampshire.But the likelihood of the bill becoming law is remote, since it did not pass by veto-proof majorities.The Democratic majority reversed another election related bill passed last year by Republicans in voting to pass SB 68, regarding access to the state’s centralized voter registration database, in a 214-141 party-line vote.Democrats have sought access to parts of the database to provide evidence in support of a lawsuit they have pending in state court, challenging the constitutionality of another Republican-passed election law, SB 3, that establishes new requirements for voter verification.Republicans last year passed a bill that specifically forbids release of the database in such situations, so the Democrats, with the majority this year, came back with a bill that specifically allows it.SB 68 is also likely to be vetoed by Sununu and did not pass with veto-proof margins.Election postponementAlso on the election front, the House and Senate finally reached agreement on who gets to postpone town elections due to bad weather or other emergencies.The House passed SB 104, which gives the town moderator clear authority and guidance on how to postpone elections in consultation with state officials.The bill is the result of extensive negotiations including the Secretary of State’s office, town moderators and the New Hampshire Municipal Association, all of whom agreed on the final language.It cleared the House on a voice vote and is expected to be signed into law by Sununu.Learn EverywhereThe House also passed a bill that gives local school boards the sole authority to grant academic credit for alternative learning or work-based programs. SB 140 cleared the House in a 224-146 vote.Critics of the bill said its sole purpose is to repeals the “Learn Everywhere” program launched by Education Commissioner Frank Edelblut, which allows the State Board of Education to grant credits for learning outside the classroom.“This program recognizes that much learning takes place outside the classroom and provides credits to students. It would be a disservice to students to repeal the program,” said Rep. Glenn Cordelli, R-Tuftonboro.Democrats, however, maintained that approving credit for graduation is the job of the local school board, not the state Department of Education.“Not every alternative, extended learning or work-based program may be suitable to meet graduation requirements established by the local school board,” according to Rep. David Luneau, D-Hopkinton.“This bill preserves local control by enabling school boards to determine when a student can be awarded academic credit for participation in these programs.”Net meteringThe House also voted to pass SB 165, known as the “Low-Income Community Solar Act of 2019,” in a vote of 229-113. The bill is designed to ensure that low- to moderate-income residents can afford to participate in community solar projects.“This aligns with one of the governor’s priorities,” said Rep. Peter Somssich, D-Portsmouth.The bill as amended provides for an additional incentive payment of 3 cents per kWh of energy generated by approved community solar arrays, above market rates, until July 1, 2021, after which the above-market payment declines to 2.5 cents per kWh.Opponents of the bill said the above-market payments, subsidized by the rest of the utility’s ratepayers, would increase electricity costs, which are already among the highest in the country.dsolomon@unionleader.com"

Martha Hennessey, D-Hanover, a retired school psychologist who led the effort to pass all three.Sen. Sharon Carson, R-Londonderry, said these changes are solutions in pursuit of no problem since New Hampshire is one of the safest states in the nation and has not had a single serious school shooting incident.“Can anyone talk about instances that have happened with guns here in New Hampshire?” Carson asked rhetorically.Gov. Chris Sununu has said action on gun measures should take place in Congress and not by changing state laws.Senate Majority Leader Dan Feltes, D-Concord, said that’s not the answer as the nation’s gun lobby has blocked any action in Washington for decades.“We have seen what has happened at the federal level. Nothing. Let’s do what we usually do in New Hampshire. Let’s take this upon ourselves and deal with it here in New Hampshire and we can and this does not conflict with 2nd Amendment rights,” said Feltes, who is considering a 2020 Democratic primary bid for governor.Regarding school background checks (HB 109), Senate Democratic leaders had rewritten the language that cleared the House, though the intent was the same to require a background check for those who buy a firearm at a gun show or engage in a private sale.“New Hampshire is safe but we have people who are killing themselves, people who are using their guns. This is a common sense law that we are trying to put into place,” said Sen. Melanie Levesque, D-Brookline.The House had approved a seven-day waiting period (HB 514) and it endorsed a ban on carrying guns on school property unless the person is just dropping off a student and the gun remains in a locked car (HB 564).Sen. Robert Guida, R-Warren, said restricting guns on school property will make students less safe.“We would be much better to put a sign on the school that says staff are trained in the use of deadly force,” Giuda said.Sen. John Morgan, D-Brentwood, said he couldn’t support a blanket policy on guns in schools and said it should be the decision of local educators in each community.Feltes said the local option strikes the right balance.“I trust our school boards. I trust that Jeffersonian principle of local democracy, of local debate that folks will organize on both sides of this issue and yes debate will occur at the local level,” Feltes said.“What’s wrong with a debate on school safety by our school boards?”klandrigan@unionleader.com"

Chris Sununu in a 247-123 vote, just meeting the two-thirds requirement.In an unusual move, Speaker Steve Shurtleff, D-Concord, voted with the Democratic caucus, saying he feels strongly on the issue. The speaker usually only votes to break a tie, but is empowered to vote at any time.The bill, HB 455, was a top priority for the Democratic majority in the House and Senate. It first cleared the House, 279-88, in March, and the Senate, 17-6, in April.Since the bill originated in the House, representatives got to take the first crack at an override vote. Senators will vote next, perhaps as early as next week or the week after.Unless two senators can be persuaded to change their vote from April, New Hampshire will become the 21st state to end capital punishment. Governors have placed moratoriums on the death penalty in Oregon, Pennsylvania and California, but the statute remains on the books in those states.Emotional debateThe House debate on the override was emotional, with several representatives alluding to personal experiences and struggling to remain composed from the well.Rep. Katherine Prudhomme-O’Brien, R-Derry, described how she narrowly escaped a kidnapping attempt as a child, and defended the state’s judicious use of capital punishment over the years.“New Hampshire does not use the death penalty irresponsibly, if at all,” she said. No one has been executed in the state since 1939.Sununu vetoed the bill on May 3, surrounded by state, county and local police officers at the Michael Briggs Community Center, named for the Manchester police officer whose killer, Michael Addison, is the state’s lone occupant of death row.

Gov. Chris Sununu vetoed a repeal of the state’s death penalty on May 3, 2019. Sununu claims law enforcement believes the rarely used penalty has a deterrent effect.


DAVID LANE/UNION LEADER



The 2006 murder of officer Briggs has been at the center of the capital punishment debate in the Granite State. Opponents of the repeal measure argued that Addison will escape execution, even though the bill states that the repeal is not retroactive.They point out that no one on death row has ever been executed in a state that has repealed its death penalty.Intense lobbyingThe lobbying on the bill was intense, as Sununu reached out to Republican representatives who voted for the repeal, asking them to support his veto.A preliminary review of the roll call vote shows that the governor managed to convince 34 Republican reps who’d voted in favor of repeal on March 7 to vote in support of his veto on Thursday, but fell just short of his goal.Rep. Kimberly Rice, R-Hudson, said she supported the repeal in the first vote, but voted to sustain the veto.“I found myself asking many questions. Mostly I asked myself, ‘Is this really a New Hampshire issue? Is this a problem in our state?’” she said. “In going forward I would ask that you (support the veto) so New Hampshire can be an example to other states on how to responsibly use the death penalty.”Rep. Renny Cushing of Hampton, whose father was murdered in 1988, has led the charge against death penalty over the years, and was the final speaker in the debate.“The death penalty doesn’t work. It doesn’t work for victims and it doesn’t work for society. It’s time to let it go,” he said. “Today is a day that New Hampshire should fully evolve on the issue of capital punishment. I hope we can feel the spirit of Amazing Grace enter this chamber and enter into our hearts.”All eyes on SenateSununu now has his hopes pinned on the Senate.“It is unfortunate that the House voted to override my veto in a rushed, politically motivated process,” he said.“I will always fight for what I believe because it is simply the right thing to do. I hope the Senate will listen to law enforcement, families of crime victims, and advocates for justice and not abolish capital punishment.”Repeal advocates are banking on the senators to vote just as they did in April.“Today’s vote by the House is an incredible vote of confidence that the death penalty is wrong and must be repealed,” said Devon Chaffee, executive director of the ACLU of New Hampshire.“State representatives from different political parties, different walks of life, and different parts of the state came together twice in overwhelming majority to clearly state that New Hampshire can live without the death penalty. We urge the Senate to follow suit so we can abolish this archaic practice once and for all.”Republicans accused the Democratic majority in the legislature of politicizing the issue by bringing the override vote forward so quickly after the veto. In recent years, the legislature has held a veto override session in late summer to deal with all overrides at once.“House Democrats chose to politicize the death penalty issue by bringing this veto forward first, and on its own,” said House Minority Leader Dick Hinch, R-Merrimack.“They’d prefer to deal Gov. Sununu a defeat first, before enduring what will be a series of defeats themselves as we vote to sustain veto after veto on their income tax bill and far-left agenda.”dsolomon@unionleader.com"

Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,NH Voices: Yurij Rudensky and Annie Lo -- Bipartisan NH bill raises bar on redistricting,"May 23, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/opinion/columnists/nh-voices-yurij-rudensky-and-annie-lo---/article_036def51-8f3e-51d1-9b64-a18f83fd2963.html,"PARTISAN GERRYMANDERING is facing its long-delayed reckoning. After decades of punting on the issue, the U.S. Supreme Court might finally establish constitutional limits for the most egregious abuses. But even if the Court draws a line in the sand, gerrymandering will continue to frustrate a core principle of our democracy: Voters should select their politicians, not the other way around.Now more than ever, legislatures and voters must take a stand in support of fair redistricting.New Hampshire is poised to do just that if the state Senate passes House Bill 706, which would create an independent advisory redistricting commission in a refreshing show of bipartisan support. It must, and should, win the approval of both parties in the legislature and Republican Gov. Chris Sununu.New Hampshire isn’t alone in trying to reform the redistricting process. A groundswell of support for fair representation led voters in Colorado, Michigan, Missouri, Ohio and Utah to overwhelmingly approve reforms in 2018 to change the way political maps are drawn.But New Hampshire stands out from the pack. All the other states have ballot initiative processes that allowed citizens to sidestep the legislature or bring lawmakers to negotiate. In New Hampshire, elected leaders from both parties willingly came to the table and joined their constituents to fight for fair maps. HB 706 was crafted by a broad coalition of lawmakers, voters, and activists working side by side since last fall.And not a moment too soon. Over the years, gerrymandering has only gotten worse. Enabled by increasingly sophisticated data and technology, politicians and their consultants have drawn contorted maps with surgical precision to ensure their party stays in power through good and bad election cycles alike.It is an issue that should rise above partisan politics and in New Hampshire, so far, it has. HB 706 sailed through the legislature — the House committee voted 20-0 to recommend the bill. And the Senate committee followed suit with a 5-0 tally.This collaborative effort in the state has led to a strong policy. The bill puts citizens — not politicians — in charge of drawing federal, state, and county district lines. And the new process ensures that voters’ needs — not politicians’ — will dictate redistricting choices. In its final amended form, the proposal effectively marries New Hampshire values with national best practices.Under this new bill, all communities in the Granite State will be represented and heard when districts are drawn. The 15 citizen commissioners will be politically and geographically diverse. And robust public oversight and participation has been baked into every step of the process.There will be no more closed-door meetings with political operatives seeking to maximize political advantage. Instead, the commission will actively seek community input through hearings and an online comment portal. All commission business will be conducted in open meetings accessible to the public. All redistricting communications and documents will be available for inspection. And, when final plans are submitted to the legislature, the commission will release a report that measures the maps against external metrics, including the new, prioritized guidelines.Under these rules, commissioners will have clear objectives instructing how districts should be drawn when they put pen to paper. Towns will be kept whole. Communities with shared identities and concerns will be preserved. Partisan and racial gerrymandering will be prohibited. The upshot, of course, is the commission-drawn map will enable voters to choose their elected officials.At the Brennan Center, we study how all 50 states draw their districts and the problems that gerrymandering creates. While there is no one-size-fits-all approach, there are designs and practices that have been proven to work. The strength of HB 706 is that it builds on lessons learned around the country.If passed, the proposal can bring about significant collateral benefits. The public should see drastic improvements in transparency and accountability. Voters should feel more connected to their representatives. Elected officials, likewise, should see more compact districts that make it easier to campaign, connect with constituents and legislate according to their needs.But the positives go beyond improvements in public confidence and politics. HB 706 advances a process that produces better outcomes.Studies have shown that redistricting commissions increase the number of competitive elections and that commission-drawn maps hold up better in court than those drawn by legislators.This is why redistricting reform is so crucial. New Hampshire has shown the country that it is possible to craft meaningful bipartisan solutions. And, if the Senate and Gov. Sununu agree, having fair districts in the Granite State will not merely be a possible outcome, it will be the norm.By passing HB 706, New Hampshire would set a new national model for eliminating gerrymandering."

The three were among 12 people honored with New Hampshire Hero Awards during an afternoon ceremony Wednesday at the McAuliffe-Shepard Discovery Center in Concord. The program is sponsored by Citizens Bank and presented by the New Hampshire Union Leader.The awards honor New Hampshire residents who have risked their lives in the previous year to save or attempt to save the life of another person.Wednesday marked the first time the event was held at the McAuliffe-Shepard Discovery Center.“It’s appropriate that we’re here, because this place is named after two brave New Hampshire folks who were pioneers in space,” said Brendan McQuaid, New Hampshire Union Leader president. “Now we honor a bunch of other great New Hampshire folks who put their lives on the line.”Gov. Chris Sununu said he was inspired by the stories he heard Wednesday.“This is the third time I’ve attended one of these as governor, and the stories are amazing,” Sununu said. “They are so amazing you literally don’t believe them until you get to meet the people here today. Today we’re celebrating stories of absolute heroism, from people who would probably tell you they didn’t think they could ever do. But when you’re put into some of these incredible situations, incredible things happen.”“Not everyone, when confronted with these situations, would have taken the immediate action that these heroes took,” said state Senate President Donna Soucy, D-Manchester. “So many of you put your lives on the line. You risked your own life to save the life of another. While one action may have catapulted you into the newspaper, and the stories that are being told here today, it’s actually the content of your character that makes you a true hero. It’s these stories that remind us about the goodness and strength of humanity that are emblematic of our New Hampshire values.”One of those honored Wednesday was Ethan Gerry of Atkinson, who was 14 when he pulled his friend from the bottom of Little Island Pond in Pelham after the friend suffered a seizure during an eighth-grade graduation ceremony.

Ethan called out to the adults at the shore for help and dove down to find his friend. After about 10 to 15 seconds, he located Matthew at the bottom of the pond and lifted his head above the water and waited for the parents who were rushing in to help.The Timberlane Regional High School freshman said he doesn’t really consider himself a hero.“I consider myself a person,” said Gerry, now 15. “I just did what anybody would do.”He said he was honored to be included in Wednesday’s ceremony.“It makes me feel kind of special,” said Gerry. “It’s a privilege to be here. I look back sometimes and think about what might have happened if I hadn’t done what I did, and how it could have been much worse. I’m glad I did what I did.”Four Nashua police officers were honored for entering a burning building last year to save an elderly woman trapped inside.

Scott Ciszek was on patrol the morning of Jan. 7, 2018, when he noticed smoke at 93 Lock St. One resident had already escaped the blaze and notified police that there was still an 85-year-old woman, Norma “Connie” Berube, inside.“I could see fire when I exited my vehicle. Flames were coming up over the top of the roof,” said Ciszek, who found his way through a side door that entered into the kitchen.“The smoke inside was pretty thick. The hallway was ablaze,” said Ciszek, who was forced to leave and enter through another door. “We had to force the front door open.”By this time, officers Alex Gangi, Colin Flanagan and Jason Reinold had arrived.“We were all low-crawling under the smoke,” Ciszek said of the four patrolmen.The flames forced the four officers to exit, but they relayed information to firefighters on the inside layout of the house, where the fire was strongest and where they believed the woman was trapped.A firefighter located Berube, who was suffering from asphyxiation with a swollen windpipe. Firefighters carried her into a waiting ambulance, where she was transported to a Boston hospital and fully recovered.On Wednesday, Ciszek said he appreciates the recognition he and his fellow officers have received for their actions that day.“You see somebody that needs help, and you try to assist as much as you can,” Ciszek said. “It’s just fortunate that we all happened to be there at the right time, at the right place. You see so many good police officers doing so many good things, and to be recognized for something that they do on a daily basis and may not be recognized for ... it’s humbling to be appreciated.”On Feb. 27, 2018, Galipeau, 35, of Derry and a Salem firefighter, was heading home on Route 111 in Windham when he came upon an accident involving a blue 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee. Linda Desmond of Hampstead, the Jeep’s driver, was unconscious and critically injured as the Jeep was catching fire.A group of motorists including Steve Collins, 62, of East Hampstead, helped Galipeau cut Desmond’s seat belt and pull her from her car window. They then carried her about 25 feet away from the burning car. Collins estimates there were three or four men who removed Desmond from her Jeep and carried her to safety, including Kirk Bredbenner of Danville.“That was the first time I was involved in something like that,” Collins said. “I was in the right place at the right time. I was put there for a reason, and I’m so thankful.”Retired Epping Fire Chief Chris Murphy had just pulled into the Epping House of Pizza on Aug. 5, 2018 to grab some lunch when he was approached by a young boy who told him that his brother was clinging to a tree in the Lamprey River.

JOSH GIBNEY/UNION LEADER



Murphy, who spent 37 years on the Epping Fire Department and had been trained for water rescues, wasted no time and headed to the river while police, fire and rescue crews were called.The river was unusually high due to heavy rains from recent thunderstorms. The boy was found hanging onto a tree about 10 feet from the river’s edge.Murphy, who was in water up to his waist, had all he could do to keep his feet on the ground as he was pulled by the current. He told the boy, “Grab my hand, grab my wrist, and I’m going to grab your wrist and don’t let go of the tree until I say let go.” On the count of three, the boy let go and Murphy was able to pull him to safety.The boy was not injured.“Things went well, but Epping police and fire were right there behind me and they would have done it,” Murphy said. “Any of them would. People train month after month, year after year, for this and they just never run into the same situation. It seems we should recognize them too.”“The distinguished acts of courage presented this afternoon are a true testament to all the good that can be found here in New Hampshire,” said Joe Carelli, president of Citizens Bank. “From first responders to neighbors, and even a 14-year-old young man, they are citizens helping citizens who have unselfishly risked their lives in an attempt to save a life or lives of others, and for that we thank you.”“These stories are so inspiring and we are honored to have the privilege of honoring them at this event,” said Stephanie Baxter, community relations and events manager at the Union Leader.The 12 honorees presented with Hero Awards on Wednesday were:• Nashua police officers Ciszek, Gangi, Reinold and Flanagan;• Collins, Galipeau and Bredbenner;• Devin Isaacs, Gregory Haggerty and Evan Antonellis of West Lebanon;• Gerry of Atkinson;• and Murphy of Epping.For more on the winners, as well as more photos from the ceremony, go to unionleader.com"
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,Kevin Landrigan's Granite Status: NH GOP pays bonus but struggles to keep $$ w/Dems,"May 22, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/politics/granite_status/kevin-landrigan-s-granite-status-nh-gop-pays-bonus-but/article_e2f87028-aef5-5d82-90a5-eb7ee889a3c6.html,"THE NEW HAMPSHIRE Republican State Committee continues to struggle to keep up with fundraising from its Democratic counterparts, but it passed a milestone last month.For the first time in its history, the chairman was paid for his fundraising prowess.GOP Chairman Steve Stepanek confirmed a $1,600 bonus he was paid on April 25 was the first paid to him as a commission for bringing in dollars to the state GOP.Two years ago the party changed its bylaws to allow the chairman to be paid.But during the tenure of former chairman Jeanie Forrester the party struggled to raise money and she left in July 2018 to pursue work in municipal government.In response, the state GOP convention last January chose Stepanek to replace her, given in part his successful history of raising big money for Hillsborough County and for former House Speaker Bill O’Brien.At that time the party changed its bylaws to permit “compensation” for the chairman.Officials said this would permit the party boss to work on commission.Stepanek said Wednesday the arrangement endorsed by the Executive Committee calls for him to get paid 10 percent of what he brings in on his own.“This is only money that I’ve directly solicited, not the result of things like fundraising emails or other correspondence the party sends out to raise money,” Stepanek said.Since January, the state GOP has raised $170,497 and spent nearly $145,000.It has $50,627 in cash on hand after starting 2019 about $25,000 in the black.By contrast, the New Hampshire Democratic Party raised $847,062 this year. Thanks to cash at the outset it has more than 10 times the GOP surplus, or a net $533,000 cash on hand.Among the large GOP donors of late are Bedford auto dealer Andy Crews ($10,000), B2W software CEO Paul McKeon ($10,000), Augusta Petrone of Dublin ($6,735) and Bedford lawyer Phil Taub ($10,000).“I’m working on potential fundraisers in Massachusetts, New York and DC,” Stepanek said. “It’s a slow slog but we are headed in the right direction.”One clear financial advantage that Democratic Party Chairman Raymond Buckley has over Stepanek is the Democrats sell their extensive voter file, while the GOP does not.In the past few months alone these sales generated more than $300,000 as both 2020 Democratic hopefuls Pete Buttigieg and Beto O’Rourke kicked in $100,000 apiece, while Elizabeth Warren already forked over $50,000.Stepanek also said not to look for massive transfers coming into the NH GOP through national party committees.The Republican National Committee’s “donation” will come from staffing up the state party.There were already four full-timers working in New Hampshire for the national party and Stepanek said “more help is on the way.”Meanwhile any financial support from the National Republican Senatorial Committee and Republican Congressional Campaign Committee will be on their own behalf.“We don’t do things like the Democrats; these committees will operate independently and provide support to our campaigns on their own,” Stepanek said.Potential GOP Senate candidate stumblesRetired Army Brig. Gen. Donald Bolduc of Stratham isn’t yet a 2020 candidate for the U.S. Senate in New Hampshire but he’s already had his first public stumble on Twitter.Earlier Wednesday, Bolduc responded to someone who praised as a military hero Navy SEAL Special Operations Chief Edward Gallagher.“God bless him and his family,” Bolduc answered.The response was met by some who pushed back at Bolduc about his comment, since Gallagher has been accused of war crimes. Those include using a knife to kill a teenage Islamic State prisoner in Iraq as well as separate incidents of killing unarmed Iraqi civilians.“He also allegedly threatened to kill his fellow SEALs if they reported him ...,” someone tweeted back at Bolduc.Gallagher is scheduled to stand trial in the coming weeks.According to published reports, President Trump at the urging of conservatives was considering pardoning several American military members, including Gallagher. The official act could come on or around Memorial Day.Within minutes Bolduc corrected himself.“I responded to a tweet that I misread,” Bolduc clarified. “I do not condone LOAC behavior. I support our justice system and respect the moral courage of those who reported the behavior.”LOAC refers to the Law of Armed Conflict and the Geneva Conventions, which cover international humanitarian law in war.One of those who tweeted outrage at Bolduc’s initial comment was understanding about the controversy.“I figured that was the case. Thank you for clearing it up General!” the person said.(For more Granite Status, go to www.unionleader.com.)klandrigan@unionleader.comShaheen gets foreign policy endorsementA nonpartisan national PAC has endorsed Sen. Jeanne Shaheen’s bid for reelection.Foreign Policy for America Action Network saluted the New Hampshire Democrat for being a “leading voice” on the Senate Armed Services Committee and the only woman on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.“Senator Shaheen has been a powerful advocate for smart, diplomacy-first foreign policy, which is why we’re proud to endorse her today,” said Andrew Albertson, treasurer of Foreign Policy for America Action Network.“At a time when President Trump is alienating our allies and threatening to send American troops into a senseless new war in Iran, we need her leadership now more than ever.”Shaheen is the first candidate the group has endorsed in 2020.It’s worth noting the group’s recent surveys have given very low grades to GOP leaders in Congress like Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (33 percent) and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-CA (23 percent).“We do favor incumbency: when an elected official in a particular seat works consistently in defense of principled American engagement in the world, we support those champions,” the PAC says on its website.“Endorsements may be made at various stages in the political cycle.”Sununu goes to bat for disabled under ObamacareGov. Sununu has faced his share of partisan attacks for criticism of the Affordable Care Act but he has called on the all-Democratic congressional delegation to support his efforts to strengthen it.Sununu said ACA rules dating back to the Obama administration in 2014 ended up preventing families of disabled members on Medicaid from being able to use a single provider agency for their care.The two-term governor said he’s been pursuing through the Trump administration without success a Medicaid waiver for New Hampshire that would allow these families who prefer to work with one agency to continue to do so.“I respectfully ask that you work to put forward legislation to change this rule and permit waivers to states,” Sununu said in his letter. “This will allow New Hampshire to continue to be the gold standard for service delivery to individuals with developmental disabilities. I stand ready to work with you in partnership to make this change.”Gun group gets new leaders at pivotal timeJust as the Democratically-led New Hampshire Legislature approaches crunch time on several gun control measures, one of the leading groups for gun owners is making a change at the top.Alan Rice, a longtime leader and president of the New Hampshire Firearms Coalition, announced recently he’s stepped down from that position to take a more prominent national post in Gun Owners of America.”The one thing that is constant in life is change. I was proud that in 2003 I was one of five founding directors of NHFC; but I have decided that after over 15 years of volunteer service it is time to move on,” Rice wrote in an email to supporters.Rice said he decided serving both organizations going forward wasn’t feasible.”As many of you know, for quite some time I have represented Gun Owners of America. I have recently been asked to take on a larger role within GOA that involves a signiﬁcant amount of interstate travel,” Rice said.”When I’m out of New Hampshire I cannot eﬀectively lead NHFC and that’s not fair to the rest of the board and the NHFC Membership.”NHFC Vice President Paul Marquis thanked Rice for his service.”By all measures we have grown on your watch. I’ve watched you work and admired your ability to take on whatever task was required to get the job done. I have especially admired your tenacity in protecting our rights,” Marquis wrote.”I wish you well on your continued service with Gun Owners Of America and I am sure we will see you soon at the State House.”All gun rights groups are working over time either to block final passage or to convince Gov. Sununu to veto measures to close the background check loophole or adopt “red flag” legislation to make it easier to take guns away from those seen by a judge to be a risk to themselves or others.Pappas leads on LGBTQ protectionsRep.Chris Pappas, D-NH, along with colleagues, introduced Wednesday legislation aimed at protecting the benefits of LGBTQ veterans who were at risk in the wake of the transgender military service ban President Trump has pursued.”As we work to improve care for veterans and combat the national crisis of veteran suicide, we cannot forget the more than 15,000 transgender service members and veterans whose benefits may be at risk because of this Administration’s discriminatory transgender ban and those left behind by ‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell’ in years past.” Pappas said in a statement.Last November, Pappas became the first openly gay person to win a seat in Congress representing New Hampshire.The measure had the backing of the Human Rights Campaign, ACLU and other organizations.”Thousands of our nation’s veterans are currently barred from receiving due benefits because of inappropriate discharges anchored in their actual or perceived sexual orientation and gender identity,” said Andy Blevins, executive director of the Modern Military Association of America.Shaheen dealt setback on women’s currencyTreasury SecretarySteven Mnuchinhanded Shaheen a political defeat with his announcement that a $20 bill redesign featuringHarriet Tubmanwill not occur by a federal 2020 deadline but instead be delayed until 2028 at the earliest.”There is no excuse for the administration’s failure to make this redesign a priority,” said Shaheen. “Sadly, this delay sends an unmistakable message to women and girls, and communities of color, who were promised they’d see Harriet Tubman on the $20 bill,” Shaheen said. “The needless foot-dragging on this important effort is unacceptable. Our currency tells our country’s story and it is past time to honor the contributions of Harriet Tubman.”Shaheen had for years pursued federal legislation to honor women on American currency and wanted the 2020 deadline met to correspond with the 100-year anniversary of women getting the right to vote.In 2016, candidate Trump had called the move “pure political correctness,” and said that Andrew Jackson should not be replaced on the $20 bill; instead, Tubman could go on a $2 bill.Recently Shaheen and other lawmakers reintroduced the Harriet Tubman Tribute Act as a way to pressure the Trump administration to keep the 2020 schedule.Will election law reform be more veto bait?A NH Senate panel moved a step closer to changing the state’s voter registration check system but will Governor Sununu stand in its way?The House without controversy earlier this spring adopted a measure (HB 315) that would have the state get out of the controversial Interstate Crosscheck Program to detect voter fraud.Critics maintain the program database is flawed, leads to too many false positives and could be used to knock voters improperly off registration rolls.The Senate’s election committee went further, however, not only to get the state out of crosscheck but to require the state instead join the Electronic Registration Information Center (ERIC), a California-based program that is a favorite among progressives.”Today’s committee vote is a critical step toward ensuring the security, accuracy and fairness of New Hampshire’s registration system,” said the New Hampshire Campaign for Voting Rights in a statement. “If Governor Sununu is serious about the integrity and security of our elections then he should sign this bill.”But Secretary of State Bill Gardner, a Sununu confidante, has been a staunch defender of the Crosscheck program.Gardner has pointed out his staff works diligently to cull all of the false positives out of the data before it reports on any instances of voter fraud.This measure still has a ways to go before heading to Sununu, but Democratic legislative leaders may like nothing better than to have an end-of-the-session fight with this governor over voter integrity.Harris lays out NH impact of equal pay reformDemocratic presidential hopefulKamala Harrissaid her equal pay plan would provide an average raise of $5,074 a year for New Hampshire women.The former California attorney general said NH women are paid just 79 cents on average for every $1 paid to men and for Hispanic women the average goes down to 64 cents.Her proposal would require companies to show that they aren’t engaging in pay discrimination and fine companies that fail to close gaps.”The Harris plan means that women will no longer have to fight big corporate employers over pay issues, a fight which can cost them their jobs and the opportunity for advancement,” said former Party Chair and Democratic National Committeewoman Kathy Sullivan of Manchester.”Corporations which are doing the right thing and paying women equally have nothing to worry about. Companies that choose to persist in discriminating will pay for that choice.”Rep. Jackie Weatherspoon, D-Portsmouth, attended the World Conference on Women in Beijing 25 years ago.”Senator Harris has a long record of advancing women’s economic opportunity and working towards solutions for these very issues, and I applaud her new plan to tackle the gender pay gap head-on,” Weatherspoon said in a statement.klandrigan@unionleader.como"
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,"Legislature to vote on death penalty, gun control, minimum wage","May 21, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/politics/state/legislature-to-vote-on-death-penalty-gun-control-minimum-wage/article_1fb717cb-295b-5f29-afe7-5689d740410f.html,"CONCORD — The House and Senate are both in session on Thursday, voting on some of the most important legislation of the year.The House is expected to take up Gov. Chris Sununu’s veto of a death penalty repeal bill, while the Senate votes on three gun control bills.The death penalty was the first bill sent to Sununu’s desk by the Democratic majority in the House and Senate, and will be the first veto override the legislature attempts this year.











Opponents of the death penalty believe they have the votes to reverse Sununu’s veto, but the lobbying and letter-writing campaigns have been intense on both sides.The bill, HB 455, cleared the state Senate with a veto-proof, 17-6, two-thirds margin, while the House vote was also veto-proof, 279-88.Those opposed to repeal would have to change the votes of two senators, and a substantial number of House members, depending on how many of the 400 show up on Thursday.The legislature has traditionally held a veto override day in late summer, so that all vetoes from the past session can be dealt with at once, but is empowered to schedule an override vote at any time after a veto has been issued.Sununu adviser D.J. Bettencourt told the conservative Granite Grok website that the governor’s office sees the scheduling of the vote as purely political, and urged fellow Republicans not to play along.“Democrats have pretended that the override vote is about conscience and principle when it is not. It’s all politics for them,” according to Bettencourt.“It started when they ensured that this was the first bill to reach the governor’s desk. The reason for this is because they knew he would veto it and they could embarrass him by having Republicans join with them to have Sununu’s first veto of the session overridden.”“I believe Republicans should stand against this partisan gamesmanship,” he said.John-Michael Dumais, with the N.H. Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty, said Republicans are the ones trying to politicize the vote by calling on representatives who oppose the death penalty to vote against their conscience to save Sununu from a loss.“Few legislative efforts have been more bipartisan than death penalty repeal, not only this year but in past legislatures. Arguments that say otherwise are all about winning and losing, scoring points and counting coups,” he said.“To suggest that the bill or the timing of the override vote is a partisan undertaking is to trivialize or outright dismiss the very real issues of life and death, ongoing trauma for victim families, extraordinary costs, inherent biases, etc., that authentically call most lawmakers to our cause.”The House will also be deciding the fate of a bill that repeals changes made to the definition of residency for purposes of voting approved by the Republican legislative majority last year.A bill that gives towns the power to rescheduled local elections in consultation with the Secretary of State will also be up for a vote in the House.Minimum wageThe Senate will be taking up a House-passed bill, HB 186, increasing New Hampshire’s minimum wage to $12 an hour in three steps by 2022. The 3-2 recommendation from the Senate Commerce Committee is that the bill be retained in committee for another year.Several election-related bills are also on the Senate docket, including HB 105, which repeals the provisions of a 2017 law (SB 3) that created new requirements for voter verification; HB 611, which allows for no-excuse absentee voting; and HB 706, creating an independent redistricting commission.A bill granting a 1.5% cost of living adjustment for retired state employees also comes to the Senate floor, with a 3-2 recommendation of “ought to pass.” The governor supports this annual increase for retirees, even though most Republicans in the legislature are opposed.The Senate will also vote on three firearms-related bills that passed the House on party lines — one requiring background checks for commercial firearms sales, one imposing a waiting period between the purchase and delivery of a firearm, and a third enabling school boards to declare gun-free zones on school property.A bill to legalize the recreational use of marijuana is expected to be put to rest for this year, as HB 481 comes to the Senate floor with a 5-0 vote from the Judiciary Committee to retain the bill.dsolomon@unionleader.com"

Eight people, including the woman and two children as well as Isaacs, Haggerty, and Antonellis, were taken by ambulance to Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center to be treated for smoke inhalation.Isaacs, Haggerty and Antonellis are being recognized as part of the New Hampshire Union Leader’s 2019 Hero Awards, sponsored by Citizens Bank.

No tax increase is planned, but spending has been cut.A hearing on the proposed budget is Wednesday at City Hall from 6:30 to 8 p.m. The council recently voted to move forward with a revenue and spending plan of $40,459,137.41, which is $1.6 million, or nearly 4% less than this year. Depending on the public’s feedback, the City Council can adjust the proposed budget up or down before a final, second vote makes the budget official.As usual, the largest portion of the municipal budget is schools, which under the City Council budget would go down from about $18.2 million in general funding to $17.9 million.Meanwhile the city budget would drop more than $110,000 to about $12.9 million.If the budget is adopted as proposed, the City Council has said two police officers, two firefighters and one public-works employee would be cut.Corinne Cascadden, who is the superintendent of Berlin schools, said on Tuesday that the School Board has made $925,076 of the $1.1 million in cuts that the City Council has requested and is hopeful that unexpended funds and unexpected revenues could close the gap.By law, the unexpended funds and unexpected revenue would go back to the city’s General Fund, and the City Council would have to vote to give them to the school district.Also, unlike a municipal budget, over which it has line-item control, the City Council can only authorize a lump-sum amount for schools, which the school board can allocate as it wishes.Cascadden expects that at the public hearing on the budget, “people are going to scream at the City Council” whereas they should more properly be yelling at Gov. Chris Sununu and the General Court.While the Berlin City Council has been “very generous over the years” to city schools, state government has not, said Cascadden. She said Sununu has to restore education stabilization grants and also increase adequacy grants while lawmakers need to be ready to act if the governor doesn’t; they need to be ready to override a veto, she said.The decrease in those two funding sources is hitting Berlin very hard across the board, said Cascadden."

This day, he was not in protective gear, but he was in the right place at the right time.“I was never supposed to take that way home,” Galipeau said. “I took a left when I was supposed to take a right. That was really strange.”The accident had apparently just happened. A blue 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee and its driver, Linda Desmond of Hampstead, were in the worst shape. Desmond was unconscious and critically injured, Galipeau said, and her Jeep was catching fire.There was also a silver 2011 Ford F-150 and a blue 2016 Subaru Outback involved in the accident, according to the Windham Police report.A group of motorists helped Galipeau cut Desmond’s seat belt and pull her from her car window. They then carried her about 25 feet away from the burning car.“Shortly after we pulled her out, it engulfed the whole car,” Galipeau said.One of the motorists who helped Galipeau was Steve Collins, 62, of East Hampstead, who was on his way to a birthday party for his grandkids when he stopped to help moments after the crash.Collins estimates there were three or four men who removed Desmond from her Jeep and carried her to safety. Police have been able to identify Kirk Bredbenner of Danville as one of the witnesses who helped.“That was the first time I was involved in something like that,” Collins said. “I was in the right place at the right time. I was put there for a reason, and I’m so thankful.”After leaving Desmond a safe distance from the burning car, Galipeau sprung back into action when he learned that there was still a driver inside the pickup truck, who was later identified as George Welch III of Derry.Galipeau found Welch lying across the seat, in a semi-conscious daze. He began to carry him alone from the truck when he inhaled some fumes from the nearby Jeep and briefly collapsed. A second man came and helped Galipeau carry Welch the rest of the way.Galipeau had earlier inhaled fumes from inside of Desmond's passenger compartment when he reached into pull her out.Another female motorist, presumably Linda Boucher of Hampstead, the driver of the Subaru, self-evacuated, Galipeau said.In the meantime, Windham Fire and Police departments showed up, as well as a medic from Salem Fire. They performed some medical interventions on Desmond, but determined her condition was critical and called in a medical helicopter.She was transported to the helipad at Lawrence General Hospital and transferred to Massachusetts General Hospital. Galipeau said he rode in the helicopter with her, and during the flight began to feel ill from the fumes.Doctors kept Galipeau at Lawrence General to monitor him for smoke inhalation for the next six to eight hours.Galipeau said the rescue was a team effort.“I’m just glad I could help,” he said.According to a Windham police report, the accident began when Welch, who was heading west on Route 111 in his Ford pickup, bumped into a guardrail on the west side, then swerved into the center median, became airborne and crossed into oncoming eastbound traffic.His truck hit Desmond’s Jeep head-on, according to police. The truck spun completely around, and the Jeep crashed into the guardrail. Boucher, who was traveling east behind Desmond, did not have time to react and crashed into the passenger side of Desmond’s vehicle.Galipeau, Collins and Bredbenner are being recognized as part of the New Hampshire Union Leader’s 2019 Hero Awards, sponsored by Citizens Bank.

Chris Sununu and members of the Executive Council earlier this month.Bremco Inc., a specialized welding services company located in Newport, will receive a $1 million line of credit guaranteed by the BFA, while Scott Electronics, a manufacturing company in Salem employing more than 100, will benefit from having the BFA work with the company’s lender to structure a $4,425,000 tax-exempt bond, lowering interest rates.“We are pleased to help these two exceptional New Hampshire companies with their growth and expansion plans,” said James Key-Wallace, executive director of the BFA, in a release. “Both of these companies have demonstrated a tremendous amount of potential, and we believe that our support will allow them to take the necessary steps to invest in growth, expand, add new employees and take their businesses to the next level. When companies like these do well, it creates opportunities for everyone across the state.”According to the BFA, Bremco Inc. is set for “a major expansion and needed capital to finance its upcoming growth.”“Bremco’s lender believed in the growth potential of the company but needed a BFA guarantee to help with the financing because the company didn’t fit into a conventional lending box,” according to a BFA news release. “The BFA will guarantee a $1,000,000 line of credit and Bremco’s growth will create over a dozen new high-quality jobs in Newport.”Scott Electronics plans to expand, adding an anticipated 30 to 40 new jobs. The company recently invested $1.8 million and eight months renovating the 40,000-square-foot first floor of its Industrial Way building, built in the early ’80s. It leases the space on the second floor to other tenants.The company began moving workers into the new space in October 2018, and recently sold its former Salem building in the same industrial park to another manufacturer.Scott Electronics makes cables, harnesses and fiber optic components for medical devices, industrial use and homeland security.The Salem plant, which handles about 60 percent of the company’s production, also has branched out into research and development.

Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,Effort to legalize pot stalls in state Senate,"May 20, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/politics/state/effort-to-legalize-pot-stalls-in-state-senate/article_ff8ea81b-1073-5121-a473-fcac382726ec.html,"CONCORD — It’s the end of the road for efforts to legalize recreational marijuana in New Hampshire, at least for the 2019 legislative session.The Senate is expected to vote this week to keep the legalization bill, HB 481, in committee for the rest of this year, with plans to try again in 2020.“We’re going to hear it again in January, but our thinking was we heard a lot of testimony from people who had concerns, and we wanted to make sure those were addressed to the best of our ability,” said state Sen. Melanie Levesque, D-Nashua, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee.The committee voted 5-0 last week to recommend that the bill be “re-referred,” and the full Senate is expected to endorse that recommendation on Thursday.The issues that merit further study, according to Levesque, include measures to prevent marketing to children and requirements for tamper-proof packaging.“There should be an advocate who is looking out for children’s needs to make sure there is no advertising directed toward them,” she said.Municipal powersThe Senate also wants further clarification on the process cities and towns can use to prevent retail cannabis sales or grow operations within their boundaries.“There are issues about municipalities voting on whether they can have an establishment, clarification about when that happens,” said Levesque. “My thought was to decide if you are going to have it or not, you would have to do it at town meeting.”Lawmakers also plan to examine ways to preserve opportunities for New Hampshire-based entrepreneurs in cannabis manufacturing and retail sales, Levesque said.The Union Leader reported earlier this month that a Canadian cannabis corporation, with an infusion of cash from one of the world’s largest alcohol distributors, is making a bid for the company that runs New Hampshire’s medical marijuana dispensary in Merrimack.“The bill does state that it will be run by New Hampshire residents for at least three years, and I would like to see that longer and understand a little bit more about how that would work,” said Levesque.Beyond those issues, there’s a public awareness campaign that needs to be waged, in which legalization opponents have outdone supporters in recent months.“There is a lot more education on the bill that needs to be done by our caucus and by others in the public,” said Levesque.Prospects weakProspects for the bill looked weak from the first vote in the Democratically controlled legislature. Although legalization was part of the N.H. Democratic Party platform going into the 2018 election (“We believe that marijuana should be legalized, taxed, and regulated”), many Democrats are apparently opposed.The House voted 209-147 to pass the bill in February after review by the Criminal Justice Committee, and 200-163 in April after review by Ways and Means. The first time, 51 Democrats voted against the bill, growing to 59 “no” votes from Democrats on the second try.With so many Democrats voting “no,” there was no way the House could hope to override a promised veto from Gov. Chris Sununu, so the bill’s fortunes were preordained even before it got to the Senate.“I still think it’s a good bill,” said Levesque. “It’s very comprehensive, but as with anything, there are still a lot of questions. We only had it for a short period of time. I’m a supporter of legalization, but I’m also an elected official tasked with listening to people. They have concerns. I just want them addressed.”Kate Frey, vice president of advocacy for the public health non-profit New Futures, suggested that the large turnout at House and Senate public hearings by legalization opponents had an effect.“We are pleased that the Senate Judiciary Committee listened to the dozens of New Hampshire residents who testified in opposition to this harmful legislation,” she said. “HB 481 proposed an irresponsible marijuana commercialization model that does not have the health and well-being of our families and our communities in mind.”Momentum stalledNew Hampshire joins the ranks of other states like New York and New Jersey, where legalization efforts that appeared to have momentum have stalled.Vermont has legalized marijuana for personal use, but not commercial sales. A Senate-passed bill to create a taxed and regulated market for the sale of cannabis products has stalled in the Vermont House, where the Ways and Means Committee has voted to hold on to the bill until next year.“We made great progress this year,” said Matt Simon, New England Political Director for the Marijuana Policy Project, pointing out that 2019 marks the first time a legalization bill ever passed House committees and advanced to the Senate in New Hampshire.Sununu’s veto threat proved to be an insurmountable obstacle, according to Simon. Recreational use of cannabis is legal in 10 states, but in each case the change came about through public referendum, which is not an option in New Hampshire.“It’s frustrating that the obstructionists have succeeded in delaying the inevitable for yet another session, but we will continue working to help legislators achieve consensus on a responsible set of cannabis policies for New Hampshire,” Simon said.“That is proving to be a slower and in many ways more difficult process than putting legalization on the ballot and asking voters to pass it, but we know we are on the right track.”dsolomon@unionleader.com"
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,"Your Turn, NH: Paul Nagy and Mark Brady -- Will Gov. Sununu correctly read the Trump tea leaves?","May 19, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/opinion/columnists/your-turn-nh-paul-nagy-and-mark-brady--/article_1d856a8c-c543-5ad4-9ed6-751ab150ca14.html,"NEW HAMPSHIRE is on President Trump’s target list as he tries to win the state’s four electoral votes in the 2020 presidential election and his success may very well come down to Gov. Chris Sununu’s willingness to enthusiastically embrace the President.We all remember the 2016 race when the Republican party establishment — aka the Romney Elite (Tom Rath, Steve Duprey, et al in New Hampshire) were less than supportive of the Donald. They savaged Trump throughout the primary process and were reluctant at best to vote for him much less actively support him in the general election.Candidate Chris Sununu, however, in the fall of 2016 did not see it quite the same way and, unlike former U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte, embraced Trump’s candidacy and rode it to the governorship. Sununu understood that by distancing his candidacy from Trump, he would be walking away from the disaffected voters who were heading to the polls for Trump.New Hampshire had the third highest voter turnout in the 2016 Presidential election at over 72 percent.Ayotte, on the other hand, was on her way to the political graveyard with the band of Never-Trumpers. She lost her Senate reelection to Maggie Hassan by 1,017 votes in what should have been a victory if Ayotte had stayed on script like Sununu.Make no mistake, the Romney Elite — let’s give them some credit — were able to suppress enough Republican establishment vote in New Hampshire for Trump to cost him a victory over Clinton. Trump lost by only 2,736 votes. New Hampshire has a very strong party apparatus.Trump would have won New Hampshire if he had gotten the same Republican vote as Mitt Romney did in 2012 in the establishment bastions of Amherst, Bedford, Exeter, Manchester Wards 1 and 2, and Stratham.Sununu won because he had the establishment vote in the bag and was smart enough to embrace Trump voters by supporting Trump. Unlike Ayotte, who had a knack for insulting Trump.Sununu leveraged Trump’s success in the blue-collar counties of Coos, Merrimack, Strafford and Sullivan, where Trump outperformed Romney by nearly 10,000 votes. Trump racked up impressive numbers in Berlin, Claremont, Franklin and Rochester.Ayotte’s 2016 campaign was reminiscent of Romney’s 2012 loss to Obama, where he really thought he was going to win the election based on his polling only to find out election night that he never had the right sample.But then that should not be surprising from Romney, who made one of the biggest gaffes in a presidential election with the 47 percent comment.One would have thought that Ayotte would have understood better the electorate in 2016 but when one looks at who she was influenced by — Romney and McCain — it all makes sense.So here we are approaching the 2020 election.While Trump and Sununu do not have an opponent yet, the national election is sure to be dominated by immigration and the economy. The Democrats’ primary campaign is setting up to be a race between hardcore socialist Bernie Sanders vs. establishment Joe Biden.And the money game is well under way. The Trump campaign has over $40 million in cash on hand (more than all Democrat candidates combined) with 99 percent from donations of $200 or less while the Republican National Committee just raised over $45 million in the first quarter of 2019, its biggest haul ever for a non-election year.Trump’s campaign has set a target of $1 billion for his 2020 reelection. Obama raised over $720 million for his reelection in 2012.Chris Sununu is on the bubble again but this time as governor. And the obvious question is what will he do?How enthusiastically will he embrace the President’s reelection, which is targeting his state?Governor Sununu read the tea leaves very well in 2016. We would bet he does the same in 2020."
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,"NH likely to join lawsuit accusing drugmakers of collusion, price-fixing","May 18, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/courts/nh-likely-to-join-lawsuit-accusing-drugmakers-of-collusion-price/article_8e3091ae-6a02-5030-9485-aecaf293a29d.html,"CONCORD — New Hampshire officials expect to join a multistate lawsuit against 20 drug companies, alleging that they conspired to fix prices on generic prescription drugs.The complaint, filed in U.S. District Court in Connecticut, alleges that Teva Pharmaceuticals and 19 of its competitors “embarked on one of the most egregious and damaging price-fixing conspiracies in the history of the United States.”It alleges that the generic-drug companies for years “would systematically and routinely communicate with one another directly, divvy up customers to create an artificial equilibrium in the market, and then maintain anti-competitively high prices.”And these deals were further “refined and coordinated” at regular industry dinners, “girls’ nights out,” lunches, parties and golf outings as well as through phone calls, emails and text messages, the lawsuit alleges.Last week, two state senators here, Tom Sherman, D-Rye, and Cindy Rosenwald, D-Nashua, called on Gov. Chris Sununu and Attorney General Gordon MacDonald to join the 44 other states that have signed on to the new lawsuit. In their May 15 letter, the senators said the increasing cost of prescription drugs “is one of the most significant challenges facing New Hampshire families.”And, they said, “the fact that these pharmaceutical companies may have intentionally fixed these prices to feed their bottom line is appalling.”Associate Attorney General James Boffetti said Friday that attorneys in that office’s consumer protection and anti-trust bureau have been carefully reviewing the 500-plus-page lawsuit with the expectation that the state will sign on to it. “Before we do that, we want to make sure that we’ve done our due diligence,” he said.New Hampshire did join a similar action filed in 2017 against six generic-drug makers, said Boffetti, who was chief of the consumer protection bureau then and is now director of the division of legal counsel at the Attorney General’s office. He said attorneys in that bureau spent an estimated 1,400 hours working on that case.The new lawsuit grew out of the states’ ongoing investigation into generic-drug prices, he said. In addition to the 20 companies, the lawsuit names 15 company executives and cites 114 specific drugs used to treat a variety of medical conditions, such as infections, diabetes, epilepsy, cancer and HIV, that were involved in the alleged price-fixing scheme.“It’s essentially alleging the same sort of conduct that we filed against them in 2017,” Boffetti said.‘Necessary steps’On Friday, Boffetti sent a letter to the two senators, telling them the Attorney General’s office is taking “the necessary steps” to join the second lawsuit against the drugmakers. And he said there is no prejudice to the state for doing so later.“Our years-long involvement in the generics investigation and litigation gives rise to great concern about the alleged conduct of the defendants,” Boffetti wrote. “I assure you that this Office is strongly committed to taking steps that are appropriate and necessary under our authority and New Hampshire law to hold these defendants accountable.”Sherman, who is a physician, is chairman of the Senate Health and Human Services Committee. The alleged misdeeds of the drug companies affect everyone in New Hampshire, he said.“All of us are patients,” he said. “All of us have an experience with illness, and hopefully most of us are healthy and don’t need ongoing care, but one of the ways we stay that way is to have access to affordable medications.”According to the Association for Accessible Medicines, an industry group representing generic-drug companies, generic medications represent 90% of all prescriptions filled, but just 22% of all spending on prescription drugs. And AAM said that 95% of generic prescriptions “are filled for $20 or less.”In a statement responding to the new lawsuit, AAM said today’s generic-drug industry is “characterized by intense competition.” And it said “illegal behavior, such as price fixing or other violations of antitrust law, is inconsistent with AAM’s rules and procedures.”But the lawsuit tells a different story.For years, generic drugs, which come on the market after patents on brand-name medications expire, “were one of the few ‘bargains’ in the United States healthcare system,” the lawsuit states. Congress passed a law in 1984 designed to keep generic-drug prices low, and it worked for a while.But prices for hundreds of generic drugs have “skyrocketed,” in some cases increasing more than 1,000%, sparking public outrage, according to the court documents. That prompted the state of Connecticut to launch a nonpublic investigation in 2014 into suspicious price increases; shortly thereafter, Congress opened its own inquiry, and the U.S. Department of Justice’s anti-trust division convened criminal grand jury investigations. Other states, including New Hampshire, joined the effort.Those investigations revealed “illegal collusion among generic drug manufacturers,” according to the lawsuit. Company executives “exploited their interactions at various and frequent industry trade shows, customer conferences and other similar events, to develop relationships and sow the seeds for their illegal agreements,” it alleges.This conduct was “pervasive and industry-wide” and has caused ongoing and significant harm to the healthcare system, the lawsuit states.Higher insurance costsPeople take generic drugs because they’re supposed to be cheaper, Boffetti said. If the allegations in the lawsuit prove true, he said, “if the scheme was a way to artificially inflate the price of generics because they were colluding to avoid competition, then it’s immensely harmful — and illegal.”Higher drug prices lead to higher insurance costs, Boffetti said, and those costs get passed on to consumers in the form of higher premiums. In addition, he said, “the harm could also be that people who need drugs, who can’t afford them, won’t get them. It’s too expensive, and they don’t take medication they should be taking.”In an appearance on the “PBS Newshour” on Thursday, AAM president and CEO Chester Davis Jr. said his members have one mission: “to make sure that they can go and produce safe, high-quality, effective medicines at a price that patients can afford.”“They aren’t focused on colluding with each other,” he said. “They’re trying to figure out a way that they can sustain their business operations so that patients can continue to benefit from the drugs they provide.”The states are seeking a court finding that the drug companies violated federal and state anti-trust and consumer protection laws; they’re looking for damages, civil penalties and “disgorgement of the Defendants’ ill-gotten gains,” according to the lawsuit.Dr. Sherman said joining the lawsuit is about doing what’s right. And in this case, he said, “What’s right is holding people accountable.”“What they did, if it’s true, is not just a breach of trust, not just a breach of federal and state statutes, but it hurt people physically,” he said. “It’s like withdrawal of care, making appropriate therapeutics out of reach of people by cost. For the sake of profit.”swickham@unionleader.com"
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,State House Dome: Gender identity bills head to Sununu,"May 18, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/politics/statehouse_dome/state-house-dome-gender-identity-bills-head-to-sununu/article_1497ef88-0edc-545e-81bb-b3ec254583b4.html,"Gov. Chris Sununu has generally been sympathetic to legislation addressing civil rights of the LGBTQ community, and has taken some flak from social conservatives as a result.Last year he signed into law two controversial bills, one adding transgender rights to the state’s anti-discrimination statutes and another banning gay conversion therapy for minors, saying at the time, “Discrimination in any form is unacceptable and runs contrary to New Hampshire’s Live Free or Die spirit.”Sununu came under fire from social conservative groups like Cornerstone Action, which criticized the governor for “failing to stand by Christian principles.”The governor’s capacity to stray from the more conservative wing of his party and tolerate the backlash will be tested once again, as two controversial bills related to gender identity are headed for his desk.The Senate on Wednesday passed HB 669 and HB 446 on voice votes. HB 669 makes it easier to change gender identity information on a state-issued driver’s license or non-driver ID, while HB 446 makes it easier to alter birth records without a court order or showing proof of sex change surgery.











“This change recognizes what the medical community already knows is true — that being transgender or gender non-binary does not require a surgical change of sex,” said Democratic House Majority Leader Doug Ley, D-Jaffrey. “These bills work in conjunction to assure accurate designation and representation for all Granite Staters.”Also headed to Sununu’s desk is a bill prohibiting any discrimination in public schools, SB 263, despite warnings from opponents about transgender students born as males participating in female sports.The 214-143 vote to pass SB 263 was largely along party lines, with only two Republicans voting for the bill. It passed the Senate, 20-3, on March 28.The bill is now before the House Judiciary Committee, where Sununu said he hopes some of the unanticipated consequences can be addressed.“We’ll take a look at the final bill, but on the whole I’m hopeful they can work some of those issues out and get it to my desk in a positive way,” he said.Lessons learnedThe Senate voted 24-0 on Wednesday to pass HB 280, designating the red-tailed hawk as the state raptor and bringing to a close a sorry chapter in state legislative history. The House has already passed the bill and there’s no doubt it will be signed into law.Students from the Lincoln Akerman School in Hampton Falls tried to have the bill passed four years ago when they were in the 4th grade, and got caught in a culture war crossfire as the debate turned to abortion and other matters having nothing to do with the red-tailed hawk.“The bill did not pass four years ago, as it was hijacked by unrelated political debates in an embarrassing moment for the New Hampshire Legislature,” said Rep. Renny Cushing, D-Hampton, co-sponsor of the legislation. “We have an opportunity to right the wrong of 2015. It is time to let the red-tailed hawk live free and fly!”Happy endingAnother lengthy legislative effort will come to a happy ending on Monday as Sununu hosts a ceremonial signing for HB 406, a bill that expands the authority of the state Department of Labor to investigate workplace accidents that kill or seriously injure employees, who don’t enjoy the OSHA protections that exist in the private sector.Samantha Wooten is expected to be on hand for the event. She’s been trying for three years to change state labor laws after her father, Tom Wooten of Belmont, was killed in an industrial accident while working for the Northfield Highway Department.Wooten tried unsuccessfully with the help of former Manchester Rep. Mark MacKenzie to have similar legislation passed in 2017.Army partnershipSununu last week joined Under Secretary of the Army Ryan D. McCarthy in signing a memorandum of agreement to join The Partnership for Youth Success (PaYS) program, a partnership between the Army and a cross section of private industry, academia and state and local public institutes.The program guarantees soldiers a job interview leading to possible employment after their service in the Army."

Arkell, was among the family members on hand for the event. Sunday marked the fifth anniversary of Arkell’s death.He was shot and killed by Michael Nolan on May 12, 2014, responding to a call about a domestic disturbance at Nolan’s home, which later exploded. As the most recent officer to be killed in the line of duty, Arkell’s was the 50th name in a list of 50 read by Attorney General Gordon MacDonald.As MacDonald read the names on the Roll of Honor, family members were escorted to the Memorial Wreath, where each placed a rose in honor of their loved one.It was the fourth such event for Heather Arkell, attending with her in-laws and two daughters. She said family members are comforted to know their loved ones will never be forgotten for the sacrifices they made.“It means a lot. It’s very humbling to see,” she said. “It’s wonderful to see they do this for the families.”This year one name will be added to the Memorial Wall, Deputy Sheriff Donald E. Callahan of the Merrimack County Sheriff’s Office.The retired Concord Police lieutenant went to work for the Merrimack County Sheriff in 1993 as a court bailiff. During a mandatory physical agility test he collapsed on the track and later died from an apparent heart attack.Gov. Chris Sununu, in his keynote address, urged the crowd of survivors, dignitaries and representatives of law enforcement from across the state to keep the names inscribed on the wall in their hearts all year long, not just during the memorial ceremony.“This year we’re paying tribute to 50 individuals and their families to remind ourselves that we will never forget their sacrifices or the commitment made by our state’s fallen heroes,” he said. “They are forever memorialized here on our State House grounds.”dsolomon@unionleader.com"
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,OpEd: Different views on death penalty repeal,"May 17, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/opinion/oped-different-views-on-death-penalty-repeal/article_ec397e12-eaaf-5944-9385-1ccbccf338eb.html,"Watching Gov. Chris Sununu’s veto of HB 455 recently, one could be excused for coming to the conclusion that all police officers in our state support the death penalty. One could also be led to believe that to support police officers you must support the death penalty or that, conversely, to repeal the death penalty is to hurt police officers. All of these conclusions would be mistaken.We served on police forces in Manchester and Derry for combined total of more than 60 years. We have seen the best and the worst that our fellow citizens could dole out. We both have friends and family currently serving in law enforcement. Yet we and dozens of other criminal justice veterans in New Hampshire want to say to you: the death penalty does not truly serve the needs of law enforcement.First, we need to say that we understand where pro-death penalty law enforcement professionals are coming from. We are taught in the Academy that police are the last line of defense against chaos and anarchy and that an attack on us is an attack on society thath deserves the swift and sure response of killing the killer.Sadly, the death penalty in practice is neither swift nor sure. The inevitable lag time between prosecution and execution required by a responsible justice system — 13 years on average nationwide — means that victim’s families will continue to be dragged into the public eye for years, causing untold additional harm. One in 10 of those put on death row are later exonerated, and innocent people have been killed. Even if we are “absolutely certain” of the perpetrator’s guilt, research shows that the poor and minorities are overwhelmingly more likely to receive death sentences. Worse, death-qualified juries automatically reject anyone who does not support the execution option, making such juries hopelessly prejudicial before a word of testimony has been uttered. Those who respect and uphold our Constitution cannot, after considered analysis of our country’s death penalty system, deny that capital punishment violates the principles of the 5th Amendment (due process), the 8th Amendment (cruel and unusual punishment) and the 14th Amendment (equal protection).On the issue of “who deserves to die,” we take issue with the practice of creating hierarchies of victims where the value of some lives are placed over others. We do not believe the lives of law enforcement professionals deserve more consideration than the firefighter, the EMT, the teacher, the coach, the parent or so many others who weave the fabric of our society. Each murder is the “most heinous” to those who lose a loved one.We are told that the death penalty will surely factor into the thinking of potential future murderers and stop them cold. But even pro-repeal law enforcement professionals in our state have admitted that deterrence is a myth. Hundreds of studies to date have failed to support the deterrence claim. Already all other New England states and all other developed Western nations have abolished capital punishment without experiencing increases in murder rates against the public or police. Why, then, do some in New Hampshire insist we hold onto it?If we value living in a society with evidence-based policies, we must face the truth that the death penalty does nothing to keep law enforcement officers safe. Instead, it wastes valuable resources — more than $6 million to date for a single case — and it needlessly burdens prosecutors, public defenders, and the courts. A sentence of life in prison without parole safeguards society while providing a harsh punishment.We naturally share the horror and grief at the loss of each and every one of our brothers or sisters in uniform. Nothing can make up for the loss, and nothing can bring them back. Demanding the death penalty for the perpetrator does not substantively help police. At most it is a symbolic act that may feel justified but that in the end does not return the benefits its proponents claim. Instead, we invite those who wish to support police officers to take a fresh look at ideas that would make a substantive and concrete difference in the quality of their lives and the lives of their families.The following is a starting point for conversations about better supporting members of law enforcement in New Hampshire:1. Better salaries2. More staff and time off to reduce stress and trauma3. Mental health services to decrease divorce rates and post-traumatic stress4. Better and more frequent training and equipment5. Better fund the court system to reduce delays6. Increase funding for community mental health and drug abuse treatment, and for sensible gun control and poverty-reduction measures7. Reform our criminal justice system to reduce recidivism.8. Vastly increase victim family compensation, fully fund child college funds, etc.We who support death penalty repeal love and respect the citizens of our state as much as those who oppose it. We simply believe that filling yet another coffin is not the best response we as a society can make. And we don’t believe that it in any meaningful way benefits those who put their lives on the line every day for our safety and well-being. We urge our legislators to override the veto of HB 455 and repeal the death penalty, putting an end this costly, outdated, inhumane, and ultimately ineffective policy."

Gov. Chris Sununu will stand for a third term.It would have been an easy, and understandable, out from that difficult job if Sununu had opted for a 2020 U.S. Senate challenge of incumbent Jeanne Shaheen. It would also have been understandable if the husband and father of young children had simply walked away from public office completely.Being a governor, at least a good one, takes a lot of time away from family and from making a better wage in the private sector. Sununu has done a good job, and he could have left with a good record behind him.As good as that record has been, it and the state are under increasing threat from a legislature that has yet to meet, or in some cases create, a problem that can’t be solved with a ton of taxpayer dollars.It is going to take a governor who can say “no” despite being called every despicable name in the liberals’ lexicon. It is also going to take someone who can win.In announcing he would seek another term, Sununu had some fun tweaking Democrats by saying he could have easily defeated Sen. Shaheen.The Democrat apparatus didn’t find that so funny.Then again, we doubt they are smiling about facing Gov. Sununu for the corner office."
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,State house roundup: Bipartisan bill restraining inaugural committees heads for House vote,"May 16, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/politics/state/state-house-roundup-bipartisan-bill-restraining-inaugural-committees-heads-for/article_4a750aea-7d77-56cc-995e-02f0b3d318d1.html,"CONCORD — The House Election Committee on Thursday voted 20-0 to endorse a Senate-passed bill that will limit contributions and tighten up the reporting requirements for gubernatorial inaugural committees.The bill is expected to go to the House next week, where bipartisan approval is expected given the 22-2 Senate vote in March and the fact that Gov. Chris Sununu has said he will sign the bill.It would limit contributions for a gubernatorial inauguration to a maximum of $10,000 per contributor, and would require back up receipts for any expenditures totaling more than $1,000 from the inauguration fund by the governor-elect or immediate family.The bill, SB 105, was submitted after the New Hampshire Union Leader reported in December that Sununu’s inaugural committee raised $450,000 to celebrate his 2016 victory, with more than $165,000 going to Sununu, his immediate family and closest advisers.More recent financial reports from the 2019 inaugural show that the committee raised much less ($250,000) and eliminated or cut back on payments to Sununu’s friends and family.“I think this bill is extremely important for transparency, and it allows the newly elected (governor) to start office on the right foot with the confidence of the people,” said Edith DesMarais, D-Wolfeboro, a member of the House Election Committee.LLC loopholeThe committee could not reach a bipartisan consensus on a bill to close the so-called “LLC loophole” in the state’s campaign finance laws, which limit corporate campaign contributions to $7,000 per election cycle.Generous individual contributors have skirted the law by creating multiple limited liability corporations (LLC’s) and making contributions from each that collectively far exceed the $7,000 limit.SB 156 would close the loophole by requiring LLC campaign contributions to be assigned to a specific individual, like the owner of the LLC.Republican opponents of the legislation argue that LLC’s are being unfairly singled out, and that the same rules should apply to donations from corporations, nonprofits and unions.The 12-8 committee vote to support the legislation fell along party lines.The committee voted to retain two election-related bills: SB 71, which would change the way certain delegates are selected for state party conventions; and SB 70, prohibiting a candidate from receiving the nomination of more than one party.RedistrictingThe Senate Election Committee also met on Thursday, and in a 5-0 vote advanced bipartisan legislation to establish an independent redistricting commission in New Hampshire, whose recommendations would be subject to legislative approval.HB 706 would create a 15-member advisory commission and establish redistricting criteria for congressional, state legislative, county commission and executive council districts.Republican Sen. James Gray of Rochester and Democratic Rep. Marjorie Smith of Durham unveiled the compromise at a May 1 public hearing on the bill, which still has to pass the Senate and be voted on again in the House, which passed a slightly different version of the bill.dsolomon@unionleader.com"
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,Public sector retirees hoping for 1.5 percent hike in pensions,"May 16, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/politics/state/public-sector-retirees-hoping-for-percent-hike-in-pensions/article_868ec77c-7962-5ff3-8f3a-54e2cd36a3b8.html,"CONCORD — More than 27,000 retired state, municipal and county employees are anxiously awaiting the outcome of a legislative debate over a 1.5 percent increase in their pensions, in a move that would cost the state an additional $1 million a year over existing pension liability starting in 2022.Local and county governments collectively will be on the hook for an additional $4 million a year, and are calling the plan an unfunded mandate that could be challenged in court.Democrats for the most part support the plan, as does Republican Gov. Chris Sununu, who gave it a ringing endorsement at a Tuesday press conference in Hudson.“For nearly 10 years, our state’s retirees have been without an actual cost of living adjustment that directly goes towards the base payment of their benefits,” said Sununu, surrounded by firefighters, police, educators and state lawmakers at the Hudson Fire Department.“The time to do something is now, and I am ready to work with the Legislature to get this done.”Sununu will be working largely with Democratic legislators to get it done, as Republican leaders in the Senate came out strongly against the bill on Thursday.“I appreciate and respect all the work our state retirees have done through their many years of service to the state which is why I have sponsored responsible COLAs in the past,” said Sen. Sharon Carson, R-Londonderry, chair of the Executive Departments and Administration Committee.“However, this COLA is an irresponsible use of taxpayer funds and creates an extreme burden on local communities who will be forced to raise property taxes to pay for it. There are better ways to fund COLAs that work for everyone and I will prepare such an amendment when the Senate meets next week.”Carson said her plan would give municipalities more control over how much COLA their retirees should receive and how to pay for it.Her statement was released just hours after her committee voted 3-2 along party lines on Thursday to endorse the bill for a positive vote on the Senate floor next week, with Carson and Sen. John Reagan, R-Deerfield, on the losing side.The bill still has a long way to go even if it clears the Senate next week. It will most likely be referred to the Senate Finance Committee for a second review and back to the full Senate for a second vote.The 1.5 percent increase would be permanent, but would apply only to those who retired prior to July 1, 2014.“The thinking is that folks who’ve retired more recently have a higher pension to begin with because they were working more recently, which usually means higher wages,” said Dianne Schuett, D-Pembroke, the bill’s primary sponsor.A retired employee’s pension is based largely on their earnings in the final years of public sector employment.The bill, HB 616, passed the House 219-149 on April 4, with only 12 Republicans voting “yes,” while 14 Democrats voted “no.”The bill is supported by the State Employees Association as well as unions representing public safety employees and teachers. It’s opposed by the New Hampshire Municipal Association.“We haven’t said the NHMA as an organization would challenge it, but we do believe it is an unfunded mandate that would be subject to a challenge, if one or more municipalities choose to do so,” said NHMA Government Affairs Counsel Cordell Johnston.dsolomon@unionleader.com"

Chris Sununu's announcement he will seek a third term as governor in 2020 and pass on a U.S. Senate challenge of Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-NH,  is hardly a big shock but it resolves the biggest unknown about state politics next year.Now the three Republicans exploring their own GOP Senate bid -- former House Speaker Bill O'Brien of Nashua, retired Army Brig. Gen. Donald Bolduc of Stratham and Seacoast lawyer Bryant ""Corky"" Messner  -- have the open field to themselves without having to worry that a big foot Sununu might one day decide he wants this nomination.O'Brien may be publicly closest to a decision he will run targeting this summer as when he'll make the final call.All signs right now point to a likely go for O'Brien.Bolduc and Messner are both meeting with activists and continue to introduce themselves.Messner did just that with an online commentary on Fox News.com earlier this week writing the liberal left was dead wrong about what millennials want.""The media would have you believe that Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., is the leader of the millennial demographic. She is not,"" Messner wrote.""Ocasio-Cortez argues that millennials need an all-powerful, constantly regulating big government to build and sustain their lives. While she panders to millennials for political gain, true next generation leaders will show their friends and colleagues a way of life that is much better than one spent relying on government and socialism.""Messner, a retired, Army ranger, came across as someone getting ready to present his own credentials to statewide voters next year.""I'm writing this today because in my career and through my service to our country, I’ve seen the good, conservative instincts in our next generation. I’m confident that despite the best efforts of the media and liberal Democrats, millennials will not be seduced by the siren song of progressives,"" Messner concluded.""As we Republicans look ahead to 2020, it’s up to us to welcome these patriots to our party, grow our team and harness their energy to help roll back tired, left-wing politicians and their exhausted big-government ideas.""Shaheen remains at this early stage a prohibitive favorite as multiple polls have shown she's easily the most popular member of the congressional delegation and financially is well on her way to building a substantial reelection war chest.But Republican State Chairman Steve Stepanek of Amherst insists the National Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee will invest in this race and views this New Hampshire Senate race as a winnable one.""We've already seen outside ads targeting some of Shaheen's past votes. She's vulnerable and as long as New Hampshire is a battleground state, which it is, this Senate race is going to attract a lot of attention in Washington, D.C., Stepanek said.Democratic race for governor will take longer to unfoldSununu's decision to stay put and ask for another two years as governor doesn't mean it will lead immediately to a flood of Democratic candidates entering this race.Senate Majority Leader Dan Feltes of Concord, for example, has made it clear he's not at all thinking about 2020 politics until the legislative business is wrapped up.Given the many policy and financial fights over the next two-year state budget this session could be more than a month away from ending.Another potential 2020 candidate for governor, Executive Councilor Andru Volinsky of Concord, is also taking his time and spending much of it to promote his cause to revisit the state's education funding formula and help the property-poor communities cope with ever-rising costs.Former State Sen. Molly Kelly of Harrisville, the 2018 nominee for governor, has no reason to be in any hurry of her own.She earned some bona fides by stepping up last year when other prominent Democrats took a pass on taking on Sununu. Then there's Manchester Mayor Joyce Craig. She's got her own reelection campaign challenge coming up this November and is not about to publicly entertain a 2020 offering of any kind.But many veteran Democrats believe this politically successful, careful and cautious chief executive from the state's largest city might be just the challenger who could retire Sununu next year.For all the above reasons, don't look for this Democratic primary race to fully shake out until near or at the end of 2019.Senate Democrats throw some House plans overboardThe State Senate's Democratic leadership began to demonstrate how in 2020 it's not about to have its new majority run on every bit of the left-leaning policy agenda that's already cleared the House of Representatives.That's why a Senate committee on Tuesday recommended unanimously to re-refer or punt until 2020 action on a bill to legalize recreational possession of marijuana.Don't look for this one to get all the way through the Senate in an election year either.Then the Senate killed House-passed bills to outlaw the use of plastic straws or single-use plastic bags (See related story).Republican State Committee Chairman Stepanek said he's not surprised Senate President Donna Soucy, D-Manchester, and her team are trying to distance itself from some of the more controversial House-passed bills.""I keep telling people we have a very target-rich environment. I can fully appreciate how they want to limit some of the targets but their members have got a lot of explaining to do to the voters for a very liberal extreme agenda,"" Stepanek said.Senate Majority Leader Feltes has said Senate leaders were focused on delivering on the promises of their Granite State Opportunity Plan that included raising the minimum wage, rolling back business tax cuts to deliver more local property tax relief and the paid family and medical leave bill Sununu has vetoed.Conservatives pan Sununu's pitch to retired first responders Sununu certainly endeared himself to retired public employees embracing Tuesday a House-passed bill (HB 616) to grant a 1.5 percent cost-of-living increase for all those who had retired at least five years ago.“For nearly 10 years, our state’s retirees have been without an actual cost of living adjustment that directly goes towards the base payment of their benefits,” Sununu said. “The time to do something is now, and I am ready to work with the Legislature to get this done.”Bill McQuillen, chairman of the New Hampshire Retirement Security Coalition, credited Sununu with recognizing that rank-and-file retirees were being denied COLAS because public employers had deliberately under-financed the system.""Time and again recent Legislatures have used the rising employer costs of the pension system as the bogeyman against cost of living adjustments,” McQuillen said. ""New Hampshire’s retired public employees are thrilled to see bipartisan support for a much-needed, modest COLA.”But Greg Moore, state director of fiscally-conservative Americans for Prosperity, said giving a COLA now will only balloon the unfunded liability.""The governor could not be more off base here. This means higher property taxes and a longer period before we pay off the state's unfunded liability. The Senate should protect taxpayers and kill HB 616,"" Moore said.What frustrated fiscal conservatives was the House vote on this bill, 219-150, had easily enough Republican opposition to it that a Sununu veto of the COLA hike would have been upheld.Given labor's strong support in the Democratically-controlled Senate, the COLA bill is a virtual lock to land on Sununu's desk for his signature.AG promotes election law chiefAttorney General Gordon J. MacDonald recently promoted Matthew Broadhead to become chief of the Transportation and Construction Bureau in the Department of Justice.Broadhead had gotten high marks from state and local election officials after MacDonald named him to head up a new election law unit in 2017.The new election law unit attorney is Nicholas Chong Yen who has been with the department since last August and previously worked in the criminal drug section of the AG's office. Chong Yen is a former, assistant Grafton County attorney and University of New Hampshire law school graduate.Marchand promoting abortion rights responseTwo-time candidate for governor and ex-Portsmouth Mayor Steve Marchand will propose at a Thursday morning news conference his own ideas for state legislation to expand abortion rights in response to the moves in Alabama and other states to ban or place further restrictions on legal abortions.""In light of recent actions in Alabama and other states, designed to accelerate a challenge to Roe v. Wade in the U.S. Supreme Court; and given the changing makeup of the Supreme Court following the confirmation of Justice Brett Kavanaugh; it is more important than ever that leaders at the state level are aggressively proactive in protecting and expanding reproductive rights for all women regardless of their socioeconomic status,"" Marchand said in a statement.Since losing the 2018 primary race for governor to Kelly, Marchand has continued to remain politically active and last month signed on as an adviser to the 2020 presidential campaign of entrepreneur and nonprofit founder Andrew Yang.Warren disses Fox News as they head for NHSen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., announced plans to return to New Hampshire to campaign this weekend and took at shot at Fox News.Last Tuesday Warren announced she rejected an invitation to do a town hall on that network concluding it would be supporting a ""hate-for-profit racket"" to do an hour-long prime time event as several of her 2020 Democratic rivals have done or agreed to do.""I love town halls. I’ve done more than 70 since January, and I’m glad to have a television audience be a part of them,"" Warren began.""But Fox News is a hate-for-profit racket that gives a megaphone to racists and conspiracists — it’s designed to turn us against each other, risking life and death consequences, to provide cover for the corruption that’s rotting our government and hollowing out our middle class.""Hate-for-profit works only if there’s profit, so Fox News balances a mix of bigotry, racism, and outright lies with enough legit journalism to make the claim to advertisers that it’s a reputable news outlet.""Meanwhile the town hall that 2020 rival Bernie Sanders did on Fox News last month got the highest rating of any such event in this entire campaign thus far.Perhaps in response, South Bend, Ind. Mayor and surging Democratic presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg agreed to his own Fox News town hall that will be broadcast live this Sunday night in Claremont from 7-8 p.m.Fox News Sunday's Chris Wallace will moderate the Claremont forum, his first of the 2020 cycle.Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn. had a Fox News town hall last week.Plans are in the works for Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-NY, to have her own.Warren's attack on Fox isn't out of left field.The Democratic National Committee announced last year it would not have Fox News as a sponsor for its sanctioned debates.Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., has not responded to the invitation from Fox News according to campaign aides though some journalists speculate that like Warren, Harris will give Fox the brushoff.Warren's surely has gotten plenty of applause on social media from liberals who don't get their TV news dose from Fox.But some at rival TV networks questioned the move.Whoopi Goldberg concluded a segment on ABC-TV's ""The View"" Wednesday by saying, “If you can’t face the Fox audience, you can’t face the U.S. It’s that simple.""Former Rep. Joe Scarborough, co-host of ""Morning Joe"" on MSNBC-TV Wednesday morning said many of the news anchors at Fox were fair journalists and Warren was missing a golden opportunity.“You have Democrats that watch Fox News, you have independents that watch Fox News, swing voters watch Fox News,” Scarborough said. “You have to get out in front of people who may not agree with you. It seems to me Fox News is a great place for Democrats to go engage and pick up a few swing voters.""Gillibrand seeks PFAS mandateDemocratic hopeful Gillibrand has come up with bipartisan legislation to crack down on an environmental issue that resonates in New Hampshire, setting a tougher standard for toxic PFAS chemicals in drinking water.Sen. Shelly Moore Capito, R-W.Va., is joining Gillibrand with the measure to require the Environmental Protection Agency to set a maximum contaminant level and primary national drinking water regulation for PFAS within two years of their bill becoming law. The measure would group all PFAS chemicals under a single maximum contaminant level.“It is the EPA’s job to protect Americans from highly toxic chemicals like PFAS, but they have failed to do what is necessary to help ensure our families in New York and across the country are no longer exposed to dangerous levels of PFAS in their drinking water,” Gillibrand said in a statement.Gillibrand has dealt with health risks from PFAS concentrations found at Air National Guard bases in her home state.While campaigning in New Hampshire last March, Gillibrand hosted events on the topic in Portsmouth and Merrimack.Hassan opens SNHU cyber warfare talkSen. Maggie Hassan, D-NH., will provide opening remarks on cyber warfare at the World Affairs Council of New Hampshire at its Global Forum to be held this Sunday at Southern New Hampshire University in Manchester.New York Times National Security Correspondent David Sanger will give a presentation on U.S. preparedness for the next cyber attack.Hassan has written or co-authored several bills to strengthen cyber defenses as a member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.The event begins at 6 p.m. at SNHU's Dining Center Banquet Hall.klandrigan@unionleader.com"

Chris Sununu said he decided to forego a campaign for U.S. Senate because he did not see the job as a good fit and much prefers being governor.Most polls see Sununu as being even with incumbent Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, who will be up for re-election in 2020. Sununu considered running for the Senate, but on Tuesday night put the matter to rest, announcing his plan to seek reelection as governor.“I absolutely love the job and look forward to earning the people’s trust to take it on for one more term,” he said.In an interview in his office with reporters after the Executive Council meeting Tuesday, Sununu said the job of U.S. Senator is “not in my wheelhouse right now.”“I’m an engineer. I like to design systems. I like to work with people ... to hear where things might not be working right, bring those ideas back and help people drive better policy,” he said.“You don’t get to do that in the Senate. I don’t know what they do in the Senate, frankly. They don’t do much. I can’t imagine going to Washington and being one of 100 senators who don’t get a whole lot done.”He said he decided to announce his decision now, even though the election is more than 18 months away, to open up the field for other Republican candidates for Senate.“Part of declaring now is there are a lot of other candidates who might want to step up and run for the U.S. Senate, and this kind of opens up the door for them,” he said.“They may need a little more time and I didn’t want to do a disservice to them, because I think Shaheen is incredibly vulnerable and any number of candidates could beat her. I wanted to make sure they have a running start.”It’s also possible the governor grew tired of being asked the question.“We can move on from that issue, and frankly, people can stop asking,” he said."
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,Council denies Pam Smart request for sentence review,"May 15, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/politics/state/council-denies-pam-smart-request-for-sentence-review/article_7eae505e-cef6-5846-8a09-96329b3bcf7a.html,"CONCORD — Pamela Smart has been denied a hearing before the Governor and Executive Council regarding her life sentence in one of New Hampshire’s most sensational murder cases.The vote against holding a hearing was 4-0, with one abstention, as North Country Democrat Michael Cryans said he did not feel comfortable voting one way or the other.Councilor Andru Volinsky was the only councilor to speak against the request before Wednesday’s vote.He commended Smart’s legal team for well-prepared materials, but said Smart still refuses to fully acknowledge her role in her husband’s death.Several of Smart’s supporters, including her mother Linda Wojas and longtime attorney Mark Sisti, were in the council chambers to observe the vote.Smart was convicted by a Rockingham County jury in 1991 of accomplice to first-degree murder, conspiracy to commit murder and tampering with a witness, in connection with the shooting death of her 24-year-old husband of less than a year, Gregory Smart.Now 51, she remains behind bars at the maximum-security women’s prison in Bedford Hills, N.Y.Jurors found her guilty of orchestrating her husband’s murder with the help of a 15-year-old lover, William Flynn, and three of his teenage friends, who tried to make the fatal shooting look like a botched robbery. The plot unraveled and the ensuing trial attracted worldwide interest.“I know the Smart family has many heart-felt supporters here. This is a difficult decision because we have to honor and respect Greg’s life as well as consider Ms. Smart’s circumstances,” Volinsky said. “I have read all the materials, and there’s one sentence that helped me make up my mind.”Volinsky alluded to the documents submitted by Smart’s attorney, in which she states, “I never wanted nor asked Mr. Flynn to murder Gregg, but I will forever carry the blame and guilt.”Volinsky called the statement, “an indication of her lack of understanding of the circumstances that put her where she is, and for that reason I don’t think I can grant a commutation and I would decline to hold a hearing.”Smart’s defense attorney, Mark Sisti of Chichester, said he was surprised that the council showed no interest in hearing his client’s appeal for clemency.“It’s kind of shocking that they don’t want to face Pam, ask her questions directly and clarify any concerns they have,” he said after the vote. “They just gave up the opportunity to ask any question they wanted to and put their minds at ease. It’s time to rip away the myth of who Pam is and get down to the reality of who she is.”Smart appealed her conviction all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which declined to hear the case. She filed her first petition for commutation in 2004 and started the process for the current petition in February of this year.Sisti says she will keep trying.“Certainly we’ll be working with her, trying to support her over the next few years and hopefully we’ll get a change of heart and be able to present materials again,” he said.The Attorney General’s office filed an 88-page letter in opposition to the request for a hearing. According to the letter from Associate Attorney General Jeffrey Strelzin, director of the division of public protection, Smart was properly convicted to a life behind bars and that’s where she should stay.“The petitioner claims that the process and evidence that led to her conviction was unfair; that is not true. What is unfair is that Greg Smart died at the hands of a young boy who was manipulated by the petitioner to carry out a murder for her own selfish reasons.”Gov. Chris Sununu commended the council vote.“I appreciate the Executive Council’s diligence in taking up this request and firmly agree with their decision to deny a hearing for Pam Smart,” he said.dsolomon@unionleader.com"

A couple of them that we noticed this week fit the bill.A U.S. News and World Report study just out ranks states based on several categories, including education, health care, infrastructure and economy. New Hampshire, not surprisingly, did well. In fact, it was ranked second in the nation, behind only Washington state.No doubt New Hampshire’s nattering nabobs of negativism will object, just as they did decades ago when the same magazine hailed New Hampshire as a standout state in a hard-luck region. Conservative Meldrim Thomson Jr. was governor back then and liberals were predicting doom and gloom for the Granite State if a broadbased sales or income tax wasn’t adopted immediately.Of course, their even older kin had hailed Gov. Sherman Adams when he predicted Armageddon if the state didn’t pass a sales tax, circa 1950.Today, the tax-and-spend crowd is dismayed that current Gov. Chris Sununu won’t let it foist a state income tax on the public in the guise of a “family leave” tax.The magazine rated New Hampshire number one in opportunity, included economic opportunity, equality and affordability. If the liberals have their way on this latest tax, the “family leave” will refer to the families, and businesses, that leave New Hampshire for greener pastures.A second ranking this week at first had us puzzled. Why would New Hampshire, which hasn’t seen much of the sun this year, rank third in the number of melanoma cases? It is a skin cancer caused by exposure to the sun and ultraviolet rays.The answer was in one sentence in the report. “It tends to occur in older people.”New Hampshire, by many accounts, is either second or third as the state with the oldest population. Well, that can be a good thing.For instance, older people are smarter. They read more.If you are one of them, put on sunscreen and wear a hat.The sun will come out, some day."

We are exhausted by the daily barrage of bitter, partisan bickering that sucks the integrity right out of our elected representatives, leaving them withering shells of hypocrisy and deceit.We yearn for a return to some indefinable, bygone era of honor and dignity that we are all convinced once existed, but can’t quite put our finger on when and where. We are certain that we were once led by principled public servants but scratch our heads in confusion as we listen to what amounts to little more than cackling and sniggering from Congressmen on cable TV.It is no wonder that fewer and fewer people trust those in Washington, much less respect them.On May 3, Rep. Will Hurd, a Republican from Texas who represents the 23rd District, which includes over a third of the Mexican-American border, came to New Hampshire and spoke with, among others, those who had gathered for a meeting of the national board of directors of the Log Cabin Republicans.Hurd grew up in San Antonio, went to public schools, served as student body president at Texas A&M and has an impressive post-school resume, including nearly 10 years as an undercover officer in the CIA, serving in the Middle East and South Asia. He is the only African American Republican in the House and is the ranking member of the House Permanent Select Intelligence Committee.He says the most important part of his job is constituent services – you know, actually serving the public – and in addition to the usual flag and tour requests, his congressional website lists “student resources” for young people needing help gaining access to college, loans and repayment plans.A conservative who believes in cutting taxes, spending and regulations, he has developed a record of standing up to, and speaking out against, the President on border security and immigration reform, undermining our national security agencies and for embracing Vladimir Putin.He also cosponsored the USA Act, a bill that laid out a bipartisan solution to immigration and border security reform. It included 48 cosponsors from both parties and offered conservative, compassionate and secure solutions to the problems we face at the border.However, under both Democrat and Republican leadership, the bill has been a refused a vote. Solving problems, it seems, is no longer a congressional priority, a perfect example of what is wrong in Washington today.On this day, Hurd’s message was reinvigorating and uplifting, offering an inspirational reminder of the founding principles of the Republican Party. He was direct and unabashed in diagnosing the ills that ail us. Want to be a bigger, better party, he asked. Then don’t be a racist, don’t be a misogynist, don’t be homophobic, don’t be an Islamophobe. He answered his own question.With a President who views every person who dares criticize him as a mortal enemy and political parties who prioritize destroying the other over preserving a great nation, real leadership is hard to come by. New Hampshire is lucky in that Gov. Chris Sununu has been equally willing to stand up and speak up for what is right, including advancing equal, civil rights for the LGBT community, and an immovable defense of New Hampshire’s tax-free status.It’s not easy, but Sununu has taken slings and arrows from both the right and the left and, like Hurd, has been reelected. Not in spite of his integrity, but because of it.In a political environment where collaborative problem solving is rejected and basic decency mocked by an adolescent President, Will Hurd sets a higher standard and in doing so, offers a salve for the wounded psyche of a tired nation.Be decent. Be kind. Be honest. Be civil. Be dignified.At the most basic level, America needs more decency from our elected leaders. America needs more Will Hurd."

Chris Sununu confirmed he’ll pass on a U.S. Senate campaign in 2020 and run for reelection to a third term as governor.Sununu, a 44-year-old Newfields Republican, made the announcement Tuesday night on social media after he and his wife had discussed his future.“Over the past few weeks, Valerie and I have taken a deep look at how my path of public service can best help New Hampshire families. Nothing is more critical to our state’s future than ensuring strong leadership in the corner office and saving our New Hampshire Advantage,” Sununu said.

“We are getting the job done ... more people are working today in New Hampshire than at any time in history. We have one of the lowest unemployment rates in the nation and wages are at an all time high.”Sununu thanked those who encouraged him to challenge Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-NH, who is seeking her own third term next year.“We all know that I would defeat Jeanne Shaheen, but others can too,” Sununu said. “Never before has a sitting twelve-year senator from New Hampshire accomplished so little.”Shaheen first won the Senate seat in 2008 defeating Sununu’s older brother, incumbent Sen. John E. Sununu, who had defeated then Gov. Shaheen for the Senate seat in 2002.Former Democratic Party Chairman Kathy Sullivan of Manchester said Gov. Sununu knew he would have been outmatched against Shaheen.“Translation: Chris Sununu knew he would lose. Why else would he be so churlish?” Sullivan tweeted.Democratic Party Chairman Raymond Buckley said in any event New Hampshire voters will retire Sununu next year.“While we regret missing the opportunity to retire Chris Sununu in a campaign for U.S. Senate, we look forward to replacing him as governor in 2020, along with his mentor, Donald Trump,” Buckley said in a statement.“After four years of enriching himself and leaving New Hampshire families in the dust, Chris Sununu will face a successful and strong challenger.”Republican Governors Association Deputy Communications Director John Burke noted Sununu is among the most popular governors in the country according to recent independent surveys.“@ChrisSununu is one of the best governors in America, New Hampshire is a better place because of his leadership!” Burke posted on Twitter.Several less well-known Republicans are considering a Senate bid next year including former N.H. House Speaker Bill O’Brien of Nashua, Portsmouth businessman Jay Lucas, retired, Army Brig. Gen. Donald Bolduc of Stratham and Seacoast lawyer Corey Bryant Messner.National GOP leaders had urged Sununu to make up his mind as soon as possible so that others who wanted to challenge Shaheen would have enough time to raise enough money and political support to compete against the state’s senior senator, who also served as governor for three terms.Sununu said it’s essential the GOP holds onto the governor’s seat, especially since the Democrats took over both houses of the Legislature last November.He again lashed out at Democratic legislative leaders for sending him the mandatory family and medical leave bill he vetoed last week that would be financed by a payroll tax hike.“What is also clear is that the (Democrats’) agenda in New Hampshire has become more radical than any of us ever believed possible,” Sununu said.“This is highlighted by the fact that the Democrats in Concord, for the first time in history, put an income tax bill on the Governor’s desk. We stood up for New Hampshire citizens and vetoed that bill, but more Washington, DC extremism is on its way and I hope you will continue to stand with me.”For the past several months, Sununu has been working behind the scenes to recruit GOP candidates to run for legislative seats in hopes of taking back control of the Legislature in 2020.Polls had showed a Shaheen-Sununu race would have been competitive, though Shaheen raised a record $1.4 million in the first three months of 2019.Several Democrats have not ruled out running for governor themselves next year, including 2018 nominee Molly Kelly of Harrisville, Senate Majority Leader Dan Feltes, D-Concord, and Executive Councilor Andru Volinsky, D-Concord.""Chris Sununu was true to form tonight showing his pettiness and lack of vision. Unfortunately, this means that Granite Staters who worry about health care, or the quality of their schools or the burden of their property taxes will get nothing from him,"" Volinsky said in a statement.""He doesn’t understand that leadership is based on innovation, competence and hard work.

Chris Sununu has signaled his willingness to sign legislation passed by bipartisan majorities that increases funding for child protection and mental health above what he originally proposed.A consensus is emerging that will likely see funding for additional positions at the Division for Children, Youth and Families, as called for in Senate Bill 6, and reforms to the mental health system for children described in Senate Bill 14.Lawmakers in the House and Senate have been moving down a path that diverged from the direction outlined by Sununu in his budget address, but the governor struck a collaborative tone in a May 13 letter to House Speaker Steve Shurtleff, D-Penacook, and Senate President Donna Soucy, D-Manchester.“Senate Bills 6 and 14 build upon the progress we have made with child welfare reform over the past two years. I look forward to signing these important pieces of legislation when they reach my desk,” writes Sununu.Senate Bill 6 passed the Senate, 23-0, in February, and last week cleared the House on voice vote after a 16-0 endorsement from the House Children and Family Law Committee.It funds 77 new positions in the Division for Children, Youth and Families over two years at a cost of $8.6 million, consisting of 57 new child protective service workers (CPSW) and 20 new supervisors.The 57 new case workers represent a 44 percent increase over the current staffing at DCYF, which has 129 existing protective service worker positions.Sununu’s version of the state budget would authorize 62 new DCYF positions, but pay for only 26. More could be funded as the agency fills its current openings and the 26 new positions.“We approach addressing this issue in a different way, most notably with the number of additional caseworkers for DCYF,” Sununu states.“While we agree that there is a need to increase the number of workers who are at the forefront of investigating allegations of child abuse, my concern continues to be that the Department of Health and Human Services may not be able to fill those positions in a timely manner.”Sununu says he has, however, been assured by senior managers at DCYF that “hiring rates have improved over the past several months and, despite initial reservations, they are comfortable moving forward to fill the additional positions contained in SB 6.”If DCYF can’t fill the 77 new positions and 30 existing vacancies, Sununu said he will work to repurpose the funding to fill other critical positions.“This will ensure the money appropriated to DCYF is used in a timely and effective manner to protect New Hampshire children,” he said.Senate Bill 14, which invests $18 million over the next two years to reform the state’s mental health services for children, passed in the House on a voice vote Wednesday and cleared the Senate unanimously in March.Its provisions include an estimated $4.5 million to create a mobile crisis unit for children, with a group of practitioners who can be deployed on short notice for emergency mental health evaluations.The bill also requires the Department of Health and Human Services to expand and streamline home and community-based behavioral health services for children in a variety of ways.Sununu said he has long supported the goals of SB 14, including creation of the first statewide children’s mobile crisis response team.He urged lawmakers to include the funds for both bills in their final version of the state budget, due to the governor by the end of June.“It is important that these bills be properly accounted for,” he wrote, “as they will have passed outside of the traditional budget process.”dsolomon@unionleader.com"

There is only so much space on the formal document symbolizing the passage of legislation. Past governors have appended any veto “message’’ in a separate document.Having noted Gov. Sununu’s use of a red marker to put a message right on the document, we have wondered whether the next veto will include a smiley face or, heaven forbid, a poop emoji.To be fair to the governor, he has to our knowledge used his dramatic veto markings just twice, on death penalty repeal and on a direct tax on people’s income to fund mandated “family leave.”We think he wanted to make sure citizens understood what he was doing.

Maine is considering it.Isn’t it time to make New Hampshire worker friendly as well as business friendly?It would both help families and help the state remain competitive.Sununu claims that he does not oppose PMFL, just this particular plan. He proposes entering into a program with Vermont, which would provide coverage just to state employees.His plan relies on a leap of faith — that because that state employee program would provide a base pool of eligible employees, private insurers would jump into the market and provide affordable PMFL insurance.Then, in another leap of faith, he says private employers would voluntarily hop on board.There are too many ifs with his plan.Even a resident scholar on economic policy at the conservative American Enterprise Institute has said that the Sununu plan may not provide a large enough pool of workers to fund the program.Another problem is Sununu’s reliance on Vermont’s participation.The Vermont state employees union, however, has rejected the Sununu proposal, instead favoring a mandatory plan.The Vermont legislature has endorsed a mandatory leave plan, not the Sununu plan.So why promote a plan that is not going to happen?Politics. Sununu has misleadingly dubbed SB1 an income tax plan.It isn’t.The plan would require employers to pay an average of $5 per week per employee to fund the program.Some or all of the $5 could be passed to employees by employers — just as many employers pass a portion of the cost of health insurance along to their employees. Alternatively, employers could qualify to self insure their employees.By calling the plan an income tax, however, Sununu (facing a tough reelection with Donald Trump at the top of the ticket) will claim that he has saved the state from an income tax.But what he will have done is stopped New Hampshire workers from access to the help they need to take care of themselves, their kids and their parents when the necessity arrives. He will have handed states like Massachusetts and New York a competitive advantage in attracting workers.It may also be that Sununu, contrary to what he has told us, really doesn’t support PMFL.Whatever his reason, vetoing SB1 is not in New Hampshire’s best interest."

New Hampshire was second, followed by Minnesota, Utah and Vermont.Gov.

He claimed she was lost at sea when the boat they took on a fishing trip sank off the coast of Rhode Island. He was rescued eight days later clinging to a life raft.On Friday Sixth Circuit Probate Court Judge David King’s decided Chakalos was not a resident and he canceled a three-week bench trial regarding Carman’s actions.The decision is all the more eye-turning especially to conservatives who two years ago beefed up voter registration requirements aimed largely at out-of-state college students starting in 2020.“This has thrown all residency into chaos,” said former Senate Majority Leader and lobbyist Bob Clegg who’s defended Gov. Chris Sununu signing the law change that went all the way up to the Supreme Court last fall.“The decision now appears to allow every person who winters in a warmer climate to be challenged at the voting polls as non-citizens. It also calls into question certain tax exemptions from elderly or veteran which can only be granted to residents.”The Democratically-led New Hampshire Legislature is debating whether to put a repeal of those changes on Sununu’s desk later this spring.In his ruling, King revealed that residency for voting was one thing but it’s quite another under estate law when it comes to the owner of real property.King cited and even considered as “instructive” the advisory opinion of the Supreme Court that concluded the controversial law on voting requirements would be constitutional.The high court opined on voting residency but not in the context of estate law, King wrote.Current state laws have more than 600 definitions of residency which are not all alike and veteran lawyers have said clients need to be made aware of the many differences between them.Voting rights definitionThe voting rights definition of residence is, “The place of abode or domicile is that designated by a person as his principal place of physical presence for the indefinite future to the exclusion of all others.”And in his decision, King decided that the West Chesterfield, N.H., mansion Chakalos had built and finished in 1991 — with its $3.1 million value, 15 rooms, in-ground swimming pool and tennis court — did not qualify as his home.Appeal being mulledThe Chakalos family through lawyer Dan Small said King was mistaken about his New Hampshire residency and they were mulling a Supreme Court appeal.“John immersed himself in New Hampshire where all of his adult and childhood friends live and where he constantly gave back to his community,” Small said. “He especially felt a part of Keene where he was from and Chesterfield where he built the home of his dreams, voted and had many joy-filled occasions with his family and friends,” Small wrote.King had ruled Chakalos was a NH resident in May 2018.But last month Carman’s newly hired legal team from the Shaheen and Gordon law firm supplied the judge with many documents and exhibits raising doubts about the New Hampshire residency claim.For example during a January 2014 interview with Windsor Police investigating Chakalos’ murder, his certified financial planner, William Rabbitt, told authorities they tried to create a New Hampshire residence profile but without complete success.“They didn’t want (John and Rita) to live in Connecticut. We wanted them to be from New Hampshire…And they have to live six months and a day and they were skirting it big time. It was gonna be a problem. We knew it was gonna be a problem. You have to live in New Hampshire and if you own a house in Windsor that looks bad, right” Rabbitt said according to court documents.Later he added, “I mean the whole idea that they live in New Hampshire and he won’t have to pay any Connecticut estate tax; he’s got to pay Connecticut estate tax because he lived in Connecticut ... it’s gonna be millions of dollars.”King wrote he only learned last month that Chakalos in 2011 had transferred the West Chesterfield home to a family trust benefiting only his daughters.And six months before his death, Chakalos and his wife executed a “residential lease” of the same house with them as tenants.King wrote that he thought Chakalos did this to establish a “record of residency” but it did not reflect that either one slept or ever lived here.Chakalos’ death certificate was changed at a later date by a Connecticut medical examiner to read he was murdered not in the “decedant’s home” in Windsor, Conn. but at what was changed to the “other second residence.”His obituary published in the Hartford (Conn) Courant said Chakalos was from Windsor, Conn., while the obituary given by the funeral home and published in the Union Leader said he was from Chesterfield, NH.John LaPenna was Chakalos’ nephew whom he paid $6,000 a month to be his driver during the last two years of his life.A Keene native, Chakalos told LaPenna it was his lifelong dream to build a palatial home in New Hampshire.“Someday I’m going to build me a big mansion up on a hill, you know,” LaPenna said Chakalos told him.LaPenna and Carman said Chakalos took day trips up to New Hampshire but said he rarely stayed overnight there.“In fact his actual residence was in Connecticut, he had a more significant and lasting connection there and he never intended to permanently reside outside that state,” King concluded.“Although counsel creatively argued that there is an old saying that a ‘man’s home is his castle,’ the evidence here demonstrates that John Chakalos’ castle was not his ‘home’ as the term is intended.”klandrigan@unionleader.com"

When done right, paid family leave is a sound policy that benefits children and families — and a critical tool in retaining our future workforce. Something we can all get behind.The Legislature’s solution to paid leave — Senate Bill 1 (SB 1) — is an income tax and, make no mistake, the people of New Hampshire will not support that approach. Democrats are quick to claim it is not an income tax, instead calling it “a premium on wages.”Let’s be clear — the Democrats’ mandatory paid leave plan that automatically deducts wages from the paychecks of all New Hampshire’s hardworking citizens runs against our ‘Live Free or Die’ spirit and is a direct tax on income. Under SB 1, you would have had no choice, money would have been taken out of your paycheck to pay for another government-run insurance program.Most concerning is that this bill opened the income tax door in New Hampshire, allowing future legislatures and unelected bureaucrats the ability to raise it at any time. The end result was my unequivocal veto.We can take a different and more innovative route to deliver paid family medical leave for families. Our plan — the details of which are thoroughly laid out in my proposed state budget — is a truly voluntary opt-in program, does not have administrative barriers or burdens, is available to all who want it and is forced upon no one who does not.It’s simple: The State of New Hampshire would provide a paid leave benefit to all state employees — free of charge. In return, this base pool of participants is large enough that premiums are driven down and any business in the private sector can choose to provide the benefit for their own employees. If a business decides not to provide the benefit, any individual employee can still choose to buy into the program on their own.In short, regardless of employment situation, individuals will have the opportunity to access an affordable paid leave plan.This common sense, innovative solution to paid leave is a win for families and taxpayers alike. Neither the State of New Hampshire nor I will ever support an income tax. I will continue to work with Senate Democratic leadership to incorporate my voluntary paid family medical leave plan into the state budget. Any ideas to improve my plan are welcome.The working men and women of New Hampshire are counting on us to get this right, and I am confident Democratic leadership will help get this done.

Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,BIA Business Perspective: To lawmakers -- Tread carefully on energy legislation,"May 11, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/business/bia-business-perspective-to-lawmakers----tread-carefully/article_3cf1c9ec-dd62-52c8-8a7d-0b3fb5b4d4ab.html,"Vitex Extrusion is one of many advanced manufacturing businesses in New Hampshire. At our 115,000-square-foot facility in Franklin, we have the capability to produce 30 million pounds of custom aluminum extrusions and components for industries including electronics, building products, automotive and sporting goods.













Andrew Curland of Vitex Extrusion


We manufacture 24/7, meaning we use a lot of power to run our industrial machinery, lights and HVAC equipment. One of the highest operational costs for Vitex is electricity.This session, the New Hampshire Legislature is pursuing policies that will — alarmingly — add to the cost of electricity and require subsidies from businesses, including Vitex, and residential ratepayers like you. These policies make it difficult for manufacturers, who drive the state’s economy like no other sector, to grow our companies here in New Hampshire.In fact, expanding in New Hampshire is a growing concern for some of us. New Hampshire individual and business electric ratepayers already absorb energy costs that are 50 to 60 percent higher than the national average — year-round! Still, many bills under serious consideration by legislators this session not only fail to lower electric costs, but instead add to them.The legislation with the largest potential cost impact for businesses and all ratepayers seeks to increase the state’s minimum percentage obligation for New Hampshire’s Renewable Portfolio Standard, known as RPS. Many states around the nation have adopted RPSes of their own that require a portion of electric utilities’ mix of generation supplied to customers must come from renewable sources such as wind, solar, hydro and thermal.New Hampshire currently requires that 17 percent of utilities’ energy must come from renewables; that percentage increases to 25 percent by the year 2025. Two proposals this session aim to raise the RPS percentage to 56 percent by 2040. The increase in the 21-year period between 2019 and 2040 called for in this legislation is estimated to add up to $5 billion in electricity costs for New Hampshire ratepayers — businesses, homeowners and renters alike.With the region already hard-pressed to meet its current electricity demand (grid operator ISO New England predicts a high likelihood of rolling blackouts by the winter of 2024-25 if our regional energy situation remains unchanged), legislators should tread carefully with this legislation. Supporting clean energy and renewables as part of an “all of the above” approach is important in attempting to address high electricity costs. However, there needs to be a healthy balance between the pursuit of clean energy and the need to ensure reliable power at all times, and to do so at rates that are at least stable, if not declining.In addition to RPS legislation, lawmakers are once again considering subsidizing biomass plants in New Hampshire by requiring utilities to purchase baseload renewable generation at above-market prices. This cost, estimated to be about $25 million annually for three years, would again be passed on to all ratepayers. This language follows a similar bill that was vetoed by Gov. Chris Sununu last year, then overridden by the Legislature.Although this legislation would seek to protect jobs in the woods products industry, mostly in the North Country, it comes at the expense of energy users, particularly large ones like Vitex, which employ tens of thousands of people throughout the state. It is simply bad public policy for policymakers to choose winners and losers in various sectors of the state’s economy.Finally, legislators are once again trying to raise the cap on net energy metering from one to five megawatts. Net metering allows consumers who generate excess electricity through their own solar arrays, wind generators or other means, to receive credit for energy sent back to the electric grid. Raising the cap on net metering isn’t the issue — and should, in fact, be aggressively promoted. The issue is the amount of credit those who generate excess electricity are given. The amount of credit in these bills is likely to fall above the “avoided cost,” a figure set by the state’s Public Utilities Commission. The “avoided cost” includes the wholesale cost of power and ancillary services related to generation. Anything paid to net metering customers above the avoided cost means other ratepayers are subsidizing them. That’s simply not fair.Instead of protecting electricity customers to the greatest extent possible from the high cost of electricity, many policy makers seek to advance policies that will further burden electric ratepayers. If New Hampshire seeks to retain existing businesses like Vitex and enable us to expand, then policymakers should be working to lower electricity costs, not increase them."
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,State House Dome: Sununu's veto style draws fire,"May 11, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/politics/statehouse_dome/state-house-dome-sununu-s-veto-style-draws-fire/article_de41ba90-a180-584b-8904-741aa0b38435.html,"Gov. Chris Sununu has begun to yield the veto pen with gusto — perhaps a bit too much gusto for Democratic leaders in the House and Senate.Senate President Donna Soucy, D-Manchester, and House Speaker Steve Shurtleff, D-Penacook, delivered a letter to the governor on Friday asking that he stop writing all over the formal signature page that accompanies bills to his desk.The page has space for five signatures, with the last being the governor’s. It has been customary for the governor to write “Veto” on the line for his signature and attach a veto message if that’s his decision.On his first big vetoes of the year — death penalty repeal and paid family leave — Sununu decided to literally add a little color. On the signature page for the death penalty veto, HB 455, and the family leave bill, SB 1, Sununu used a bright red marker to write VETO, before signing and dating it.











He then added some commentary using the same red marker on each signature page. On the death penalty signature page, he wrote: “God Bless Officer Briggs and His Family,” a reference to the slain Manchester officer whose murderer awaits execution on New Hampshire’s death row.That might have been left alone, if not for the fact that the signature page for the family leave bill was marked up in a similar fashion, with the red-ink VETO in inch-high letters, above a three-line notation: “No Income Tax. Not Now! Not Ever!”According to legislative leaders, the governor’s commentary is occupying space on the form needed for official use.“While we are disheartened with your decision to veto the paid family and medical leave bill this week, we write today to express our deep disappointment with your decision to once again spoil a bill’s signature page with your personal veto statement. It is improper and below the dignity of the State House and its officers,” the letter states.The signature sheet is returned to the clerk of the House or Senate, depending on where the bill originated.“Your message on each of these signature sheets will impede these constitutional officers from executing their responsibilities. … In accordance with past precedent and practicality, any message a governor wishes to convey on the actions taken on a bill should be reserved for the official veto message, not the official signature page.”Hopefully, the matter can be resolved soon because there are many vetoes that lie ahead. One Republican lawmaker was overheard in the cloakroom saying as many as 60 bills could be vetoed this year.Some bills signedThe governor has signed 17 fairly uncontroversial bills into law, including:HB 372, requiring that motorists give a wide berth to all vehicles displaying blue, red or amber emergency lights, not just stationary vehicles;HB 248, allowing a driver to make a right turn even if a pedestrian signal is flashing as long as the driver gives the right of way to a pedestrian who might be there; and,HB 307, removing the requirement that drivers’ license photographs be in color.License billOne of the most controversial bills of the session will be up for a vote in the Senate on Thursday, HB 397, “relative to drivers’ licenses for New Hampshire residents who do not possess a Social Security card.”This is likely to be the end of the road for this one, even though it passed the House, 204-137.The bill will come to the Senate floor with a 4-0 committee vote recommending it be shelved, at least for this year.The DMV strongly opposed the bill, warning it would set the stage for identity fraud. The ACLU recommended it be re-referred to committee to address privacy concerns.Smart petitionThe Executive Council is expected to decide this week if it will hold a hearing for Pamela Smart, who is seeking clemency in connection with one of New Hampshire’s most sensational murder cases.Smart was convicted by a Rockingham County jury in 1991 of accomplice to first-degree murder, conspiracy to commit murder and tampering with a witness in connection with the shooting death of Gregory Smart, her 24-year-old husband of less than a year.The vote before the five-member council on Wednesday will be to decide if she should get a chance to make her case for a sentence commutation, which would allow her to some day apply for parole.dsolomon@unionleader.com"

Chris Sununu made the right decision for New Hampshire. He properly called it what it is, an income tax.The Democratic Party, chief pusher of this “family leave” law, denies that a mandatory tax on everyone’s paycheck is an income tax, which is why it is not to be trusted whenever its gubernatorial candidates take the pledge to veto such a tax.Gov. Sununu is not without heart on the issue of individuals needing extended paid time off from work for family emergencies. But rather than the heavy-handed and costly approach of Senate Bill 1, Sununu wants to partner with Vermont in trying an innovative plan. It would cover state employees and then leverage that substantial number (18,000 workers) to attract insurers to offer it in the private sector.A lot of companies offer such paid leave now. They have to do so to be competitive with an ever-shrinking work pool. Some companies can’t afford to do so, in which case the Sununu plan may be a good option for them, and for their employees.Legislators are doing their darndest to mess with New Hampshire’s booming private sector.They want to take money from the state unemployment compensation fund, which is supposed to be for a rainy day; and they are trying to make it rain by reneging on promised cuts to business taxes.If this bunch gets the governor’s chair, too, we will soon be seeing something new: The New Hampshire Disadvantage."

Chris Sununu told Fox News on Wednesday that he couldn’t wait to veto the paid family medical leave bill that Democrats planned to put on his desk, and late Thursday afternoon he made good on the promise.The Republican issued a 5 p.m. statement indicating that he’d signed his veto message, without fanfare.













GOV. CHRIS SUNUNUHas alternate approach


“Senate Bill 1 is an income tax that neither I nor the people of New Hampshire will ever support,” Sununu said. “I have proposed a paid family medical leave plan that will work — one that is voluntary, affordable and income-tax free. That is the New Hampshire way.”SB 1 cleared the Senate along party lines, 14-10, in February and was the first Senate bill to be acted on by the House, in a 219-142 vote in March, also along party lines.The bill sets up an insurance program that would provide 60 percent of wages for up to 12 weeks of qualified leave annually, funded by 0.5 percent universal withholding from paychecks. Individuals could not opt out of the program, but their employers could if they offered a similar benefit independently.Republicans describe the bill as an income tax because of the mandatory deduction from paychecks.Sununu has proposed a very different paid family medical leave plan of his own in cooperation with Vermont. Under Sununu’s plan, the two states would offer paid family leave as a benefit to their combined 18,000 employees, and allow non-government workers to join the program at their own expense.On Wednesday, Sununu was in New York for a series of media appearances, including three spots on Fox News and one on CNBC.“If Sununu cared about creating paid family and medical leave then he would have agreed to work with legislators as they crafted their paid-leave legislation, instead of spending the day promoting himself on conservative media,” said state Democratic Party Chair Ray Buckley.Sununu told Fox Business host Trish Regan about the bill, and said, “I can’t wait to get home and veto it — with pride.”Democrats called Sununu’s proposal “half-baked,” and said its viability has been widely questioned.House Republican Leader Dick Hinch, R-Merrimack, predicted that the veto would be sustained, and called SB1 “a poorly constructed bill that sets us up for failure.”“It is a likely-to-be-insolvent, state-run insurance program funded by a mandated 0.5 percent tax on wages, costing workers and businesses $168 million per year,” he said. “It would cost more than $15 million to develop and require over 40 new government employees to administer.”Amanda Sears, director of the Campaign for a Family Friendly Economy, said recent polls showed widespread public support for the plan Democrats proposed.“With this veto, Governor Sununu has placed partisan politics before the financial security of working families,” Sears said.dsolomon@unionleader.com"

She used one student’s situation as an example.“She works for a big retailer in Concord, doing exactly what I did 40 years ago, putting things on shelves, helping customers,” said Smith. “She makes slightly more than minimum wage, bringing home about $400 a week.”Despite the stereotype of minimum wage workers, Smith’s student is not a teenager. “She’s a mother with two teenage kids, and this is what she has to live on,” said Smith. “She qualifies for food stamps, rental assistance and Medicaid. In other words, she is considered to be living in poverty.”Smith was one of a long line of witnesses testifying before the Senate Commerce Committee on Thursday in support of a House-passed bill to raise the minimum wage in New Hampshire from the current federal minimum of $7.25 an hour.If the bill, HB 186, becomes law, the minimum wage would rise to $9.50 in 2020; $10.75 in 2021; and $12 in 2022. The minimum for teens younger than 17 would be $1 less in each case.Tipped employees would be guaranteed a base rate of not less than 50 percent of the applicable minimum.That bill passed the House, 210-145, in March, and now competes with a Senate-passed minimum wage bill, SB 10, that takes a slightly different approach. The Senate passed SB 10 in a 14-10 vote, also in March.The Senate bill, sponsored by Senate President Donna Soucy, D-Manchester, links the minimum wage to the availability of paid sick days.It would raise the minimum to $10 in 2020. As of Jan. 1, 2022, the minimum would rise to $12 an hour, except for employers who offer at least 10 paid sick days. They would only have to pay $11 an hour.The Senate bill also differs with the House on how to treat tipped employees, setting the minimum hourly wage for employees who receive more than $30 a month in tips at $4.One of the two bills is likely to reach the desk of Gov. Chris Sununu, who has said he believes minimum wage policies are a federal and not a state issue.“Regardless of political party, we should all agree New Hampshire is better equipped to make economic decisions that impact our workers and businesses than politicians in Washington, D.C.,” says Soucy.“Increasing the minimum wage is a critical step forward we can take to support our working families and continue growing our economy.”The N.H. Federation of Independent Businesses, the association of convenience store owners and the Business and Industry Association oppose both bills.Lobbyist Henry Veilleux, representing the N.H. Lodging and Restaurant Association, testified on Thursday in opposition to the House bill, stating a preference instead for the Senate bill.“It provides an innovative approach to the tip wage and we are very supportive of that,” he said.The House Labor Committee is expected to schedule its hearing on the Senate-passed bill next week.The bills have passed largely along party lines in both chambers, and would not likely have the votes to override an anticipated gubernatorial veto.dsolomon@unionleader.com"

But they are here illegally and shouldn’t be living or working in our state or driving on our roads for that matter.Instead of addressing the fact they are here, it could incentivize a migration of illegal immigrants to our state.It could send the message that we not only tolerate but encourage their presence.The implications are dangerous. In affording an illegal immigrant a privilege which is reserved for N.H. residents, we may also be handing them the tool they need to take advantage of other rights and resources reserved for lawful residents — including our sacred ability to vote.

These reasons include caring for a newborn or newly adopted child or a seriously ill family member as well as tending to one’s own serious illness.Kristin Smith, a family demographer at the Carsey School of Public Policy and a research associate professor of sociology at UNH, says that 69 percent of New Hampshire workers are in favor of a requirement that all workers participate and pay into a paid family and medical leave insurance program.“When those who opposed an all-worker program were asked if their opinion would change if they were told that allowing workers to opt out of the program would result in those who opted in paying substantially more for coverage, 34 percent changed their mind and no longer opposed the requirement of participation,” Smith wrote in a data snapshot posted online.Democratic leaders and others around the state have been rallying this week in support of SB 1, a paid family and medical leave bill that Gov. Chris Sununu is likely to veto even though it fast-tracked through the Senate and House earlier this year.In Portsmouth on Monday, Democratic State Sen. Martha Fuller Clark said they have heard stories about individuals who could not be with their spouses at a time when their life partner was dying because they were worried about losing their job.“That is not a situation that anyone should have to face,” Fuller Clark said.On Wednesday, State Sen. David Watters, D-Dover, said paid family and medical leave is important to increase the number of successful businesses in the state.“What I hear the most in my district is that businesses need workers and they want to keep workers,” Watters said. “Large employers and small employers alike, the people I talk to say they want to do what’s right for their employees.”Watters said the $5 per employee per week cost of paid family and medical leave could be passed on to employees, who want these provisions from their employers.Amanda Sears, director of the Campaign for a Family Friendly Economy, said paid family and medical leave is one of her organization’s top priorities because it protects both families and employers.“I was astonished when I was talking to a pretty large manufacturer of thousands of dollars of goods and they told me their cost to recruit an employee,” Sears said.Sears said research shows that following the birth of a child, women who have paid family and medical leave put in 17 percent more hours in the year following that birth, meaning offering time off immediately after a baby helps retain and strengthen career women who might otherwise fall out of the workforce.“This is real for employers,” Sears said.The data snapshot released Wednesday says October of 2018 was the period for which researchers conducted public opinion polls. Their results on paid family and medical leave opinions were statistically unchanged from earlier research conducted in 2016.Levels of support for paid family and medical leave did not vary significantly between regions in the state, according to Smith."

I’m honored today to sign SB 1, which would ensure every hard-working Granite Stater has access to paid family and medical leave, and I hope Governor Sununu considers this legislation with an open mind,” Senate President Donna Soucy, D-Manchester, said in a statement.Sununu has repeatedly branded the bill as an “income tax” and clearly has enough Republicans in both the House of Representatives and the state Senate to uphold his veto if he chooses to do that.Senate Majority Leader Dan Feltes, D-Concord, has been the target of state Republican web ads attacking the plan, even as Feltes considers whether to mount a campaign for governor in 2020.“Paid family and medical leave is a critical tool to help New Hampshire attract and retain the workforce of tomorrow, meet the care-giving needs of our aging population, and combat our opioid epidemic,” Feltes said. “After years of work on this issue, it’s time to finally enact this bipartisan legislation to ensure Granite Staters can maintain financial security when they need to take time away from work to care for themselves or a family member.”The governor spent part of Wednesday in New York City, according to spokesman Benjamin Vihstadt.“Governor Sununu is down in New York to advocate for New Hampshire’s priorities in front of a national audience. No fundraisers, all state business — highlighting New Hampshire’s innovative solutions to the country’s most pressing problems,” he said.Democratic Party Chairman Raymond Buckley criticized Sununu’s travel plans.“If Sununu cared about creating paid family and medical leave, then he would have agreed to work with legislators as they crafted their paid leave legislation instead of spending the day promoting himself on conservative media,” Buckley said in a statement. “Selfish Sununu lied to Granite Staters by promising to establish a program on the campaign trail, and now that it’s time to act he is out-of-state leaving New Hampshire families behind.”Sununu and Vermont Gov.

This bill is another step in the right direction.”Rep. Renny Cushing, D-Hampton, said it strikes the proper balance.“By providing judges more discretion and greater consideration when determining if a person presents a danger to themselves or others and addressing concerns about people who repeatedly fail to appear after being released, this legislation brings further clarification to last year’s reform,” Cushing said.The American Civil Liberties Union of New Hampshire maintained there was no need to make any changes.Legislative leaders and Sununu had heard from local and state police that last year’s measure made it too easy to release offenders that authorities could still have concerns about.(For more Granite Status, go to www.unionleader.com.)klandrigan@unionleader.comPotential Senate hopeful has the meansBryant Corky Messner hasn’t made any final decision on a Republican run for the Senate in 2020 but he could be a self-funded candidate if he goes that route.Messner is the founder and CEO of a Denver-based law firm with more than 100 lawyers as of 2017.According to real estate documents, he had an 8 percent stake in a Denver office building that sold for $21 million in 2015, which meant he likely received nearly $1.8 million as his share.One of his major corporate clients, according to the firm’s website, has been Chipotle Mexican Grill.According to Securities Exchange Commission filings, Messner’s firm was paid $8 million in legal services from 2004 through mid-2006 and the firm has continued to represent the chain this year.Messner’s vacation lake house in Wolfeboro was most recently assessed at $637,800.And he co-owned another house in Colorado that sold for over $1.7 million in 2007.Health care reformHouse and Senate Democratic leaders have acted and will soon put another ticklish bill on Sununu’s desk, this one to enshrine the basic provisions of the Affordable Care Act into state law.This would ensure that whatever Congress does with regards to repealing all or part of the ACA, its protections would remain in place here. Those include coverage for pre-exisiting conditions, mental health and substance abuse services and maternity care.“I urge Governor Sununu to sign SB 4 into law, allowing families to breathe a sigh of relief in knowing that New Hampshire believes that the insurance industry deserves consistency,” said Rep.

It passed the Senate, 20-3, on March 28.The legislation came to the House floor with an 11-7 vote from the House Education Committee and will now go to the House Judiciary Committee for another public hearing on May 15 before a second House vote.It amends state education law to state that, “no person shall be subjected to discrimination in public schools” on the basis of age, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, race and all other attributes protected by existing civil rights statutes. Gov. Chris Sununu last year signed a bill adding gender identity to that list.Extending civil rights protections to public school students was the first recommendation of the Governor’s Advisory Council of Diversity and Inclusion, established by Sununu in 2017 after an incident in Claremont described as the attempted lynching of a young boy.Allegations of racist behavior at UNH also played into the council’s creation. More than 100 incidents of reported bias at the state university in 2016 included the vandalizing of school property with racial slurs and swastikas.“This is crucial, landmark legislation that will alleviate suffering and serve to empower families, children and educators,” said Rep. Tamara Le, D-North Hampton, who pointed out that New Hampshire is the only state in the Northeast without specific protections for public school students in anti-discrimination law.Litigation concernsThe bill allows any person claiming discrimination to sue the school or school district in Superior Court, and calls on the Attorney General to enforce the new law where necessary.Opponents said they support the idea of prohibiting discrimination in public schools, but warned that the bill as written will lead to litigation and unanticipated consequences. The bill is opposed by the state School Boards Association and School Administrators Association.“Let’s not make this a lawyer employment act and saddle our school districts with frivolous lawsuits and related costs,” said Rep. Glen Cordelli, R-Tuftonboro. “Let’s take time to study the issues and get this right.”Cordelli presented an amendment converting the bill to a study committee, which failed, also along party lines.Rep. Rick Ladd, R-Haverhill, former chair of the Education Committee and a former school principal, said he is concerned that there are no exceptions in the bill, particularly for interscholastic athletics.“The impact of transgender athletes in our interscholastic athletic programs, especially as it relates to fair competition and safety, is a very important issue that has to be discussed,” he said. “We are moving forward into an area that is going to be a lawyer’s dream of litigation.”Rules in placeSupporters of the bill noted that the state’s high school athletic association already has rules in place that enable students to play on teams that align with their gender identity.“The Governor’s Advisory Council has already studied this and did the work. There’s no need for another study committee,” said Le. “We must ensure all children feel safe so they can be successful.”Sununu said he supports the concept of the bill, and hopes the concerns of House opponents can be addressed in negotiations with the Senate before the final version gets to his desk.“Discrimination in any form runs against New Hampshire’s Live Free or Die spirit,” he said in a statement. “There have been concerns about unintended consequences of this bill and I encourage legislators to address these concerns in a committee of conference.”dsolomon@unionleader.com"

Sununu to make our voting process fair and make ensure that everyone who wants to make a difference in this state has that opportunity,” he told students gathered in the hallway that connects the governor and secretary of state offices.The students engaged in protest songs and heard from several other speakers, including Executive Councilor Andru Volinsky, D-Concord, whose district includes UNH and Keene State.

He alluded to three election-related initiatives that are high on the Democratic caucus agenda for 2019.“Most people think of three challenges when it comes to voting,” he said, “A poll tax on students, gerrymandering and not having no-fault absentee voting. The fourth problem is the arrogance of people who won’t listen to you. So thanks for being here and standing up not only for your voting rights but for the voting rights of others.”The protest was organized by a coalition of three groups —NextGen New Hampshire, the New Hampshire Young Democrats and the New Hampshire Youth Movement, which branded the event a “State House Youth Agenda Takeover.”In their testimony before the Senate Finance Committee on the state budget, the activists called for additional state funding for the University System of New Hampshire.Members of NH Youth Movement occupied the offices of Sununu and Gardner in planned acts of civil disobedience.The three groups previously delivered what they called a “Youth Agenda” to the State House, calling on the governor and legislature to address climate change, college affordability and voting rights.

The students were there on Tuesday largely in support of legislation repealing new election laws that changed the requirements for voter identification and proof of residency.House Republican Leader Dick Hinch, R-Merrimack, describes the election bills passed in the last two years as common-sense measures that made New Hampshire law consistent with voting requirements in other states.HB 1264 changed the definitions of resident to make voting in New Hampshire a declaration of residency, thus requiring a change of driver’s license and motor vehicle registration within 60 days of voting.SB 3 changed the procedures for voter verification, particularly for those trying to register within 30 days of an election.The bill to repeal the definition of residency law, HB 106, passed the House 213-154, while the bill to repeal the voter verification law, passed 209-155, both along party lines. They are now before the Senate and if they pass there, Sununu has his veto pen at the ready.dsolomon@unionleader.com"

Bush, and his deputy, headlined a lineup of high-profile experts to speak against marijuana legalization before a Senate committee on Tuesday.John P. Walters, director of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy from 2001 to 2009 was joined by Dr. Bertha K. Madras, now director of the Laboratory of Addiction Neurobiology, at Harvard Medical School.They were recruited by state Sen. Bob Giuda, R-Warren, an aggressive opponent of the marijuana legalization bill now working its way through the legislature, HB 481. The bill has passed the House and is now before the Senate, which is expected to vote on the legislation next week.Gov. Chris Sununu has promised to veto the bill, which does not appear to have veto-proof support in the House or Senate. That hasn’t stopped opponents like Giuda from pulling out all the stops.In addition to Walters and Madras, other expert witnesses testifying at Giuda’s invitation included Dr. Karen Randall, an emergency room physician from Pueblo, Co.; Dr. Russell Kamer, medical director for Partners in Safety, White Plains, N.Y.; Will Jones, head of outreach for Smarter About Marijuana, Washington, D.C.; and Tiffany Davis, founder of Moms Against Marijuana Addiction.“We decided we would try to bring in people who were recognized and prominent masters of science, medicine and public policy to bring attention to the consequences of this bill,” said Giuda.Walters said he has not testified frequently since departing the White House to become chief operating officer of the Hudson Institute, a public policy think tank in Washington, D.C. With New Hampshire the only New England state that has not legalized marijuana, he felt the trip was worthwhile.Sen. Harold French, R-Franklin, asked how New Hampshire could hope to enforce its existing laws on marijuana when it is surrounded by other New England states and Canada that have legalized its recreational use among adults.“Unfortunately, you’re right,” said Walters. “These poisons have been unleashed on much too wide a scale and for far too many people. It’s dangerous and will be a continuing problem, but it’s unsustainable.”Walters predicted that legalization will be rolled back in some states.“The question is not whether this is going to continue,” he said. “It will have to be reversed because of the consequences. The question is how many of your citizens and children are going to be safer because you didn’t give in. You’re seeing more questioning of this all the time. We’ve made some terrible mistakes in legalization, but I can tell you people are now aware and frightened of the consequences.”Madras compared marijuana to opioids and said, “cold hard evidence is being ignored or dismissed by users, believers or those with financial interests.”“We’ve become a nation awash in opioids and marijuana,” she said. “Although the two drug classes have different adverse consequences, similar strategies were used to convince the public, to convince regulators, physicians, policymakers and medical professionals to dismiss or disregard the harmful effects. There’s egregious neglect and it’s rampant.”Tuesday’s hearing was the second on the bill before the Senate Judiciary Committee, which heard from other national experts brought in by Giuda at its first hearing in April.“In recent weeks, New Hampshire seems to have been attracting opponents of cannabis legalization like flies,” said Matt Simon, New England political director for the Marijuana Policy Project.He took issue with the way Walters and others described the experience of Colorado in legalizing cannabis, which they described as a “disaster.”“Nothing could be further from the truth,” said Simon. “Licensed retailers in Colorado have sold more than $6 billion worth of cannabis to adult consumers since 2014, and the state has collected over $850 million in taxes. And although opponents initially warned that teen use would skyrocket following legalization for adults’ use, it has actually declined.”dsolomon@unionleader.com"

Current rates allow for payment of about $12.50 an hour for home health aides.“I don’t know how many people would be willing to work for $12.50 an hour without any increase in pay or benefits for so many years,” said Nancy Kelleher of Goffstown, who spoke with her daughter, Megan, at her side.Megan has special needs and congestive heart failure, and has been unable to recruit any aides at the current pay levels. Her mother described the workforce shortage in health care as “critical and overwhelming.”“It’s our responsibility as members of the community to speak out,” said Kelleher, struggling to maintain her composure. “This rate increase will enable me to pay at a higher rate, but it will also keep her alive. I need help and I need this to pass.”In a demonstration of bipartisan support for the bill, Democratic sponsor Sen. Cindy Rosenwald of Nashua was joined at the podium by Republican Sen. Jeb Bradley of Wolfeboro.“The fact that there are 2,000 unfilled vacancies in health care is a significant issue that our state faces,” said Bradley. “This is an incredibly important piece of legislation. We have to have realistic expectations, but there is an absolute need for these provisions, especially on student loan repayment and higher reimbursement rates for Medicaid providers.”

Representatives of health care providers and their clients staged a rally in front of the State House on Monday in support of a bill that would pour another $88 million a year into Medicaid rates and health care workforce development.


SB 308 also expands the use of telemedicine, creates new programs for data collection on the existing health care workforce, simplifies the criminal background checks for new employees, provides scholarships for students in health care fields and funding to enhance programs of study in health care.The bill passed the Senate on March 27 in a 23-0 vote, but was immediately tabled so that it could be included in budget negotiations with the House.The organizations and individuals represented at Monday’s protests are hoping the funding will be included in the legislature’s version of the two-year budget and that Gov. Chris Sununu will sign it into law.Sununu spokesman Ben Vihstadt pointed to the governor’s version of the budget, which calls for a one-time investment of $24 million to expand nursing and other health care degree programs in the state university system.SB 308, however, commits the state to millions of additional dollars in Medicaid and student loan repayments for years to come.“While Gov. Sununu will review the final language of the legislation should it reach his desk, he is concerned about such a large expenditure outside of the budget process, especially with ongoing costs,” said Vihstadt.Bradley said he anticipates the bill’s main components will be negotiated as part of the budget process that usually winds up by mid- to late-June.Stephanie Pagliuca, director of the recruitment at Bi-State Primary Care Association, with offices in Bow and Montpelier, Vt., says the status quo can’t be sustained.“In the community health centers we represent there are more than 100 vacancies and it can take months to fill an open position,” she said.“What that means is that sometimes we can’t offer new services or continue to offer services, because we don’t have the providers to do the work.

Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,NH Voices: Jay Surdukowski -- A solution for Sununu inaugural issue,"May 5, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/opinion/columnists/nh-voices-jay-surdukowski----a-solution-for/article_10e793a6-8876-5971-bf16-61c99cadf307.html,"EARLIER THIS year, a Union Leader story by Todd Feathers revealed that the Chris Sununu Inaugural Committee, an IRS-registered nonprofit, paid more than $165,000 to the governor’s family and close associates, including his sister and father.Besides optics of self-enrichment, such conduct can be illegal — both federal and state laws forbid self-dealing except when certain hurdles are cleared and carefully documented to ensure the funds are handled ethically. Charitable organizations can be punished for violating the public trust, which is part-and-parcel of non-profit status.If this storyline sounds familiar, President Donald Trump’s inaugural committee is simultaneously being investigated, with federal subpoenas issued, citing investigation into conspiracy against the United States, false statements, mail fraud, wire fraud, money laundering and inaugural committee disclosure violations.Political theater has ensued with the governor being dogged at public appearances by giant checks representing the tens of thousands in committee funds paid to family and friends. The director of the New Hampshire Charitable Trust Unit has been reluctant to get involved so far, despite a parallel and directly on-point state law to the federal laws prohibiting such conduct (RSA 7:19-a). The state Senate in a 22-2 vote enacted new rules to provide greater transparency for transactions between future inaugural committees and family members of a sitting governor. The bill met with unanimous approval in the House Election Law Committee and is expected to pass.A quick way to clear the air here would be to let the sun shine in on whether the committee properly acted in such a way to avoid conflict of interest or whether there was unlawful self-dealing that has now steadily been compounded in the court of public opinion by a reluctance to allow lawmakers or the press to get to the bottom of things quickly and easily by examining the direct evidence. The secrecy is all the more unusual when the committee purports to be acting for the public welfare; part of the bargain to have federal nonprofit status.Indeed, some funds pay for what in any other world should be government’s responsibility—things like the Governor’s Easter Egg Hunt, and the committee in part states in its IRS filings it will work on energy policy and on “official functions that benefit the State of New Hampshire… not funded otherwise through the governor’s office.” There is a reason legislators and the press continue to dig deeper.Casey McDermott of NHPR has reported that the Inaugural Committee did in fact have a conflict of interest policy — or at least it has one now; the policy is undated though it appears to have a law firm document identifying number in the lower right page. The committee previously refused to disclose the policy until NHPR figured out that it promised the IRS in its annual filings to make the conflict of interest policy available upon request. The policy seems to call into question the very actions that the committee undertook with the payments that may—or may not—have been legal. In a nutshell, should a nonprofit like the committee retain services of close family or associates, such expenses are possible if certain ethically-driven conditions are met. Importantly, in the case of the governor’s sister who received a substantial five figure payment, she objectively would need to be very good at what she does to be preferred over all other vendors. Did any other vendor even have a shot, or was a decision made to enrich the Sununu family with contributions to a nonprofit?To the extent regulators have—or will—open an investigation, the following three requests could be of service in a subpoena:Please release all minutes of the committee for the 2017 and 2019 inaugurals . Are the conflicts of interest contemporaneously discussed and documented, did conflicted members recuse themselves from discussions and votes, was there quorum for a decision, did the decision obtain the required 2/3 threshold from disinterested members, and were the discussions free of favoritism or preference for family members and long-time associates?Please release any records of whether other decorators or party planners bid for the work of the committee, as well as all emails and texts between committee members and the governor or his staff or agents in which the decision was made to hire the governor’s sister’s party planning firm over any other such vendor.Produce contracts or invoices for payments to family and close associates. Please also provide an explanation for how the fair market value of the services was determined pursuant to law.These three simple requests and related questions will shed light on whether the transactions were above board or not under both state and federal law."

Constellation, whose brands include Corona beer, Robert Mondavi wine and Svedka vodka, obtained a 37 percent stake in Canopy.Some who favor legalization see the consolidation as inevitable in an emerging industry, while a spokesman for Gov. Chris Sununu said he views it as validation of his concern that legalizing cannabis sets the stage for Big Tobacco 2.0.

A bud of flowering cannabis being grown legally in New Hampshire.


DAVID LANE/UNION LEADER FILE


All of this is taking place against the backdrop of a debate over full legalization in New Hampshire and an upcoming vote on a bill to allow the state’s medical marijuana dispensaries to convert from nonprofit to for-profit entities.Hampton Rep. Renny Cushing, prime House sponsor of the legalization bill, says he is concerned that the trend toward consolidation will close out opportunities for New Hampshire-based entrepreneurs in the medical market that now exists and a legal recreational use market that might some day exist.The Canopy-Acreage partnership is already in danger of being eclipsed by a $1 billion merger announced May 1.Publicly traded Curaleaf Holdings, based in Canada, has announced plans to buy privately held Cura Partners, a West Coast wholesaler whose Select marijuana brand is the best seller in states that have legalized, according to Barrons. Between them, the two companies did $205 million in business last year, compared to Canopy Growth, whose 2018 sales were less than $120 million, Barrons reported.“I don’t like any of it. I don’t want to see a concentration of power that creates barriers to entry preventing other people from entering the market,” said Cushing.Little guy squeezed outPaul Morrissette, a Franklin-based businessman who was unsuccessful in his bid to obtain a license to operate one of four dispensaries in the state, points out that companies like Acreage can’t technically purchase Prime ATC because the dispensary license is not transferable.According to the rules set up to enforce the medical marijuana law in New Hampshire, “A change of ownership of the ATC shall not be allowed.”The license remains with the Prime board of directors, but day-to-day operations are in the hands of the management company, Acreage. Public records show Acreage is paid around $1 million a year in consulting fees and thousands in interest on loans to Prime for operating capital.“So the multinational corporation can’t technically own the New Hampshire ATC,” Morrissette says. “But it can, however, totally control it and strip out any potential profit through a never-ending management contract.”“And as it happens, a bill is already halfway through the Legislature to change the ATC business model from not-for-profit to for-profit just in time for the possible legalization of cannabis in the next couple of years.”Acreage may not technically own Prime ATC, but its management talks like it does. Acreage CEO Kevin Murphy told Cannabis Business Times in a 2018 interview that when the company first got into the cannabis business in 2011, legalization was not as popular among U.S. voters, so Acreage built its organization quietly from state to state.“We wanted to assure ourselves backing in each state, and we didn’t necessarily want to be the big, bold brand, so we tended to operate in the various states under different names,” he said. “In one state, we’re Prime Wellness of New Hampshire. In Illinois, we’re Nature’s Care. The west coast … had different names, and we also wanted to have a local feel.”The Cannabis Business Times article includes a photo of the Prime ATC dispensary in Merrimack, with this caption: “Acreage Holdings’ Prime Alternative Treatment Center in New Hampshire, where the company holds one of four licenses in the state and operates a 30,000-square-foot production facility.”An early investorIn 2011, Murphy invested in four of the eight medical license holders in Maine, becoming a part of their operations. He was also one of the earliest investors in the Merrimack operation.“Kevin Murphy has been a part of our organization since its beginning,” says Brett Sicklick, CEO of Prime ATC in Merrimack. “He was and is our chief financial officer. There has always been a close relationship there.”Sicklick says that relationship works to the advantage of Prime ATC and its patients, given the capital and other resources a company like Acreage can bring to the organization.“As Acreage grew, there was an opportunity to really gain additional resources and knowledge that would make Prime ATC a much better business, advance its goals of being the best therapeutic cannabis provider we can be, and tap into resources that weren’t available,” said Sicklick in a recent interview.“That includes access to more information and more intellectual property that at the end of the day is going to benefit patients in New Hampshire, because we have intentions of becoming the best and the brightest in the industry.”dsolomon@unionleader.com"
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,"Reaction swift, strong to death penalty repeal veto","May 4, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/politics/state/reaction-swift-strong-to-death-penalty-repeal-veto/article_d82339c9-0607-5ae5-b636-7cdc7339b414.html,"CONCORD — Reaction was swift and strong on both sides to Gov. Chris Sununu’s veto of legislation to repeal the state’s death penalty.“The time to end the death penalty in New Hampshire is now. The overwhelming evidence is that state-sanctioned murder is not a deterrent to criminals; putting criminals to death is significantly more expensive than life in prison, and too many innocent people have been executed, or (are) exonerated just before executions,” said state Sen. Martha Hennessey, D-Hanover.“Life in prison without parole is the appropriate and humane form of punishment for perpetrators of the most heinous of crimes.”Sununu’s veto came at the Michael Briggs Community Center in Manchester on Friday where he was surrounded by local and state police officers.Within a few hours of Sununu’s own post on Facebook, he attracted more than 500 comments, many praising the two-term Republican for maintaining support for capital punishment.Michael “Stix” Addison, the convicted killer of Manchester patrolman Briggs nearly 13 years ago, is the only one on New Hampshire’s death row.“I was 12 when officer Briggs was shot. I’m supporting his memory and police officers all over this state. I’m supporting my governor on his veto,” said Rep. Joe Alexander, R-Goffstown.Former U.S. Sen. and past N.H. Attorney General Kelly Ayotte said while state laws can’t be applied retroactively, there would be no legal way to carry out Addison’s execution if repeal of the death penalty became a reality.The Democratic-controlled House of Representatives and state Senate have passed this bill (HB 455) by veto-proof majorities.Rep. Renny Cushing, D-Hampton, wrote his first death penalty bill 21 years ago and said he believes the Legislature will take up the override question by the end of this month.Cushing doesn’t take for granted that he could be just weeks away from the dream he’s had since becoming a capital punishment repeal advocate after his father was murdered at his home in 1988.“We’ve seen before the pressure that can be brought to bear. What I do feel good about is that in both parties this remains a deeply held vote of conscience and as long as that is the case it’s possible we can bring this home,” Cushing said during a telephone interview.Former governor and now Sen. Jeanne Shaheen vetoed a death penalty repeal bill in 2000. At that time, however, the Legislature was much more closely split and Shaheen, a Democrat, knew lawmakers would sustain her veto.The same was true last year when Sununu vetoed an identical bill. Sununu knew that with GOP control of the Legislature at the time, there was no chance that veto was going to be overridden.“We’ve really built such an eclectic group. Along with progressives you’ve got libertarian Republicans who don’t want government to have this kind of power, some conservatives who see it as just another failed government program and pro-life Republicans who oppose murder from cradle to grave for any reason,” Cushing said.Senate President Donna Soucy, D-Manchester, stressed each senator will make up their own mind.“While I continue to believe it is time for New Hampshire to repeal capital punishment, I have the utmost respect for my State House colleagues, the votes they have taken, and those they will cast in the future on this important matter of public policy and personal conscience,” Soucy said.Rev. Jason Wells, executive director of the New Hampshire Council of Churches, was grateful at the strong support for repeal in the religious community.“The Council’s many member denominations are diverse in their practice of the Christian faith but are unanimous in regarding capital punishment ‘problematic and unacceptable,’ ” Wells said. “This belief is rooted in our understanding of the sacredness of God’s gift of life. It is also rooted in the Christian commitment that God can bring redemption to any person, an opportunity which the death penalty closes off.”Sununu’s supporters insist it remains a deterrent even in a state that’s not put someone to death since 1939.“Excellent move, governor. Now we should not be reluctant to use it when absolutely necessary so that it will actually be a deterrent to further senseless premeditated murders,” said former state Rep. Fred Rice of Hampton.klandrigan@unionleader.com"
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,State House Dome: Legislature tries again to save biomass plants,"May 4, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/politics/statehouse_dome/state-house-dome-legislature-tries-again-to-save-biomass-plants/article_d7fa5b3e-d213-5573-87e2-2b5aad1b3cf6.html,"When lawmakers override a gubernatorial veto, they expect the bill to become law, unless overturned by the courts.But that’s not what happened last year, when the Senate and House mustered the two-thirds required to negate Gov. Chris Sununu’s veto of a renewable energy bill designed to subsidize the state’s six wood-burning power plants.After the override in September, the state’s largest electric utility, Eversource, was supposed to negotiate contracts with the wood-fired power plants to purchase their energy at above-market prices.More than six months later, no such contracts have been signed. Four of the plants have already suspended operations, with the two others likely to follow.So it should come as no surprise that a coalition of Democratic and Republican senators on Friday announced new legislation to overcome legal challenges to the law now before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).











“The biomass industry is at a crisis point, and these legal challenges are undermining jobs in the forest products industry and reliability in New Hampshire’s generation mix,” says Sen. Jeb Bradley, R-Wolfeboro, prime sponsor of SB 365.A group calling itself the New England Ratepayers Association last fall filed a petition with FERC, claiming the state was usurping FERC’s sole authority to set wholesale energy prices by ordering utilities to make wholesale purchases at above market rates.NERA is the same organization that has lobbied for Northern Pass and new gas pipelines.With that legal action pending, Eversource and the six power plants were unable to come to a power purchase agreement, and the Public Utilities Commission refused to order the utility to do so.“These delays prevent the plants from operating under the law’s benefits and, instead, force the plants into economic shutdown,” says Bradley.Not content to sit by and watch their will thwarted by a skillfully conceived regulatory challenge, Bradley and three of his peers on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee on Tuesday will formally submit an amendment to a House energy bill.Bradley says the amendment will “support the enacted state policy to protect the biomass industry rather than continuing to wait for resolution in a legal fight waged by the law’s opponents.”The amendment aims to neutralize the NERA argument about wholesale rate-setting by using the state’s renewable-fuels portfolio law.Passed with near unanimous support in the House and Senate in 2007, the law requires all electric service providers to purchase a certain percentage of their electricity from in-state, renewable-energy sources, including wood-fired or small-scale hydroelectric plants.A service provider has to prove it purchased the requisite amount of renewable energy by buying renewable energy credits from the eligible suppliers. If the utility can’t find enough renewable energy to meet the requirements, it makes “alternative compliance payments” that go into a Renewable Energy Fund.All of this forces energy suppliers to buy a small portion of their electricity at higher than market rates, or pay penalties, in the interest of fostering a renewable energy industry that might not otherwise evolve, and to reduce carbon emissions.The amendment coming on Tuesday will expand available credits to include the baseload energy generated by the six biomass power plants.The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee will hold a hearing on the amendment on Tuesday and a full vote is anticipated by the middle of May.“Biomass is an important tool for managing our forests that we cannot lose,” says Sen.

William Hurd, R-Texas, made his first trip ever to New Hampshire Friday to speak at a Rockingham County Republican barbecue in Kingston.“My goal is to make sure the future Republican Party looks like one with the values and principles that drew me to it,” said Hurd, 41, an ex-CIA agent serving his third term in the House.“If you are under the age of 40 in some parts of this country you have to whisper that you are a Republican. This is the role the Northeast plays. The only way we are going to win back the House is to capture seats in New England.”Hurd is also the only Republican serving in Congress who represents a district that borders Mexico.His 800-mile political turf, with a 70 percent Hispanic electorate, crosses two time zones running from San Antonio to El Paso, Texas.In 2017 Hurd spoke against President Donald Trump’s plan to build a wall along the entire border, calling it a “third-century solution to a 21st-century problem.”Instead Hurd has advocated for: a “flexible, sector-by-sector approach” to empower Border Patrol agents on the ground; making greater use of technology; and bringing on more immigration judges to more quickly process those who come here legally.Hurd agreed with Trump that now the nation faces a “crisis” with 120,000 people streaming across the Mexican border last March.The solution lies in many changes to streamline legal immigration, curb abuses in the asylum system and help improve the economies of border countries that are pushing more people to seek a new life in America, he said.“Our asylum process is being abused; there is no question about that. The people who get hurt are the people who should be getting asylum; they are being disadvantaged by the system we have,” Hurd said during a telephone interview.“The root cause is the violence and the lack of economic opportunity in the Northern Triangle countries of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala. This is not a United States problem; this is a Western Hemisphere problem.”But Hurd admitted a comprehensive immigration solution prior to the 2020 election is unlikely due to partisan infighting.“It’s going to be difficult and that’s hard for me to say that we may not get something done. My father always used to say bring a PMA, a positive mental attitude to everything you do,” Hurd said.In March 2017, Hurd made national news when then-neighboring Rep. Beto O’Rourke and he live-streamed a trip they took by car from San Antonio to Washington, D.C., after a northern snowstorm made air travel impossible.“He’s a good guy,” Hurd said of Democratic presidential candidate O’Rourke.“I disagreed with a lot of his principles, but what we were trying to do was show that a Republican and Democrat could work together.”“He is one of the few in the Democratic race who says he’s a capitalist. As I travel throughout my district what I find is voters, independents, Republicans and Democrats are ready to be inspired about our future.”Hurd said the aim of this initial trip to the first-in-the-nation primary state was to raise concern about the “far-left leaning” agenda of the top Democratic presidential candidates and their congressional leaders.“This is the NBA of politics and the NBA of backslapping and baby kissing. People here have been fantastic,” Hurd said.Hurd said there’s been enough said and written about Attorney General Bill Barr’s handling of the Mueller report.“I think the next step that needs to happen is that Bob Mueller needs to testify,” said Hurd as negotiations are underway for the special counsel to testify perhaps later this month.“Let’s have the person who did the work come and talk about it,” Hurd said.Voters remain most concerned about future foreign interference in U.S. elections, he added.“My constituents want to talk about, ‘What are we doing to defend against Russia in the future?’ ” Hurd said.“We should be thankful an American did not collude with the Russians in 2016. How are we dealing with disinformation going forward? Shouldn’t we be developing a counter information program to deal with those future threats?”"

MANCHESTER — Gov. Chris Sununu vetoed legislation to repeal the death penalty Friday surrounded by about 30 state, county and local police officers at the Michael Briggs Community Center, named for the officer whose killer is the state’s lone occupant of death row.The governor acknowledged the bill he vetoed received bipartisan support in the House and Senate that was “pretty overwhelming.”The inner city youth center, which is headquarters for the Police Athletic League, is named in honor of the slain Manchester police officer whose 2006 murder has been at the center of the capital punishment debate in New Hampshire.

Also on hand for the veto signing were members of the Briggs family, some of whom had previously testified against repeal as the bill worked its way through the legislature.Michael Addison, already a convicted felon when he shot officer Briggs, is the only person on death row in New Hampshire, which hasn’t executed anyone since 1939.A recurring theme among repeal opponents has been the fear that Addison’s sentence will be converted to life without parole if the death penalty is repealed, even though repeal advocates argue that the law can’t be applied retroactively.After the veto signing, Sununu said he believes in the death penalty as a matter of sound public policy and that he would have vetoed a repeal whether or not the state had an inmate on death row.

Law enforcement and the family of murdered Manchester police officer Michael Briggs applauded Gov. Chris Sununu’s veto of the death penalty repeal on May 3, but the Legislature narrowly overrode the veto.


UNION LEADER FILE



“The reason is quite obvious,” he said, “when you talk to law enforcement and ask if this serves as a deterrent, they say ‘absolutely.’ People in this state understand that this is a tool and when you use it justly and with prudence, as New Hampshire does, it’s appropriate.”Repeal cleared the state Senate on April 11 with a veto-proof, 17-6, two-thirds margin. The House passed the repeal measure, HB 455, on March 3, also by a veto-proof vote of 279-88. Only 16 votes are needed in the Senate to sustain an override.

Twelve Senate Democrats voted for the repeal bill along with Republicans John Reagan of Deerfield, Harold French of Franklin, Bob Giuda of Warren, David Starr of Franconia and Ruth Ward of Stoddard.Sen. Kevin Cavanaugh of Manchester was the only Democrat to vote against repeal. Democratic Sen. Lou D’Allesandro, also of Manchester, has voted against repeal in the past but was not present for the latest vote.Sununu said he would do everything he could to “engage citizens in this process.”“When you get to sustaining or overturning a veto, a lot of dynamics come into play,” he said. “So we’ll go back and talk to folks. We’ll keep fighting for it. The vote was pretty overwhelming, to be honest. Politics didn’t come into play.

Chris Sununu’s proposal to build a new forensic hospital to help with a myriad of mental health issues, including emergency-room boarding of patients and the placement of patients who have not been criminally adjudicated into the Secure Psychiatric Unit located at the Men’s Prison.At the end of the day, a solution has been a long time coming. It’s been used as a partisan talking point by legislative Democrats, supposedly concerned about the fact that patients without any criminal involvement are being placed in a prison treatment environment. But their concern began and ended with political convenience. As soon as Sununu’s budget landed in the House, the funding was slashed. Playing both sides of the issue, House Democrats called the project premature and ill-conceived.Worse, the funding they did decide to put in the House budget toward mental health was a paltry $1.5 million, a sum they claimed would allow for kids to be transferred from New Hampshire Hospital to a more appropriate environment, renovate the vacant unit, and create some transitional housing around the state. Setting aside the fact that $1.5 million won’t cover those projects, the constitutional concern of non-convicted persons receiving treatment within a prison remains unaddressed.This should not be a partisan issue. The Legislature should do the right thing, build the new facility. People are waiting for the treatment they need, and we’ve got a solution.TROY POOLELitchfield"
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,State Senate OK's 'home-grow' for therapeutic cannabis,"May 2, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/politics/state/state-senate-ok-s-home-grow-for-therapeutic-cannabis/article_cd49297c-24a0-5df7-b622-440746b989bb.html,"CONCORD — The state Senate on Thursday voted 14-10 to allow patients in the medical marijuana program to grow their own, in the hope of increasing access and affordability for patients who can’t get to one of the state’s four dispensaries or can’t afford what they charge for therapeutic cannabis, which is not covered by insurance.The vote was mostly along party lines, with Democrats supporting this expansion of the medical marijuana program, while most Republicans were opposed.Senate President Donna Soucy and Sen. Lou D’Allesandro, both Manchester Democrats, voted with the Republicans, while GOP Senators John Reagan of Deerfield and Harold French of Franklin voted with the Democrats.Reagan co-sponsored the bill, HB 364, with Rep. Renny Cushing, D-Hampton, both long-time advocates of legalization.Opponents of the bill expressed concern about the lack of security surrounding home-grow operations, and the potential for diversion to the black market.Sen. Tom Sherman, D-Rye, introduced a floor amendment just before the vote that removed a provision in the bill that allowed for gifting any excess cannabis to other qualified patients.“We don’t gift other medication or pharmaceuticals, so this floor amendment removes gifting altogether,” he said.Sherman, a medical doctor, said he has seen therapeutic cannabis help patients in his gastroenterology practice.“I have certified at least eight patients as meeting the state criteria for therapeutic cannabis,” he said, “and every one of them is off opioids at this point. I can’t underscore how important this is as a component of their therapy.”Allowing such patients the option of home-grown cannabis, said Sherman, “is a question of access and affordability.”If signed into law, the bill would allow qualified patients to cultivate three mature cannabis plants, three immature cannabis plants and 12 seedlings, where the plants are not subject to public view.The Senate-passed version of the bill differs in some details from the House version, so the bill will go to a conference committee to see if those differences can be resolved.Gov. Chris Sununu has been outspoken in his opposition to legalizing marijuana, but said he will carefully review the language of the home-grow bill should it reach his desk.dsolomon@unionleader.com"

The bill passed the Senate 23-0 on Feb. 14.The 57 new case workers represent a 44-percent increase over the current staffing at DCYF, which has 129 existing protective service worker positions. Those number are much higher than what Gov. Chris Sununu recommended in his proposed budget.Sununu’s version of the state budget would authorize 62 new DCYF positions, but pay for only 26. The governor has argued that more could be funded as the agency fills its current openings and the 26 new positions.“I continue to believe we need to put more front-line workers in the field to protect our most vulnerable children, and will review the final language of the bill should it reach my desk,” he said.Rep. Carol McGuire, R-Epsom, argued against the bill.“It increases the number of people in that department in an unsustainable way and the costs have not been considered properly,” she said.Supporters of the bill say the funding will help address a staffing shortage at DCYF to bring caseload levels in line with the national standards. The agency has been under intense scrutiny for the past five years after child fatalities and costly settlements involving cases under DCYF review.“Unfortunately, right now New Hampshire is failing our kids,” said Sen. Jon Morgan, D-Brentwood, chief sponsor of the bill after the House vote.“DCYF is facing a funding shortfall and caseworker staffing shortage so severe it has left them struggling to fulfill their critical role, managing caseloads nearly four times the national recommended average. We can and must do better.”Morgan said additional staff will also have to be added to support the new caseworkers, including nurses and secretaries.Mental health fundingLawmakers also achieved bipartisan consensus on the need to invest heavily in mental health services, as the House passed Senate Bill 11 on a voice vote. The bill cleared the Senate on Feb. 21 in a unanimous 24-0.It authorizes $4.4 million for renovations to existing hospitals to create up to three new inpatient psychiatric units, each with no fewer than eight beds; $2.1 million for transitional housing for people with serious mental illness; and $3 million for a new mobile crisis team for rapid deployment in cases of mental health crisis.It also appropriates $600,000 to fund new inpatient psychiatric beds at existing health care facilities; and $500,000 to increase Medicaid rates paid for inpatient psychiatric services.The bill requires insurers to cover boarding and care provided to patients waiting in emergency rooms for a bed at the state psychiatric hospital, and for mental health services provided while they wait.Medicaid work requirementThe House voted along party lines, 210-150, to approve a bill making changes to the work requirement for able-bodied adults who qualify for government-funded health insurance under the state’s expanded Medicaid program.The provision that Republicans objected to most was one that stated the work requirement would be revoked if it caused more than 500 individuals to lose coverage.“This bill will result in less incentives for enrollees to participate in our economy in a way that may help them get off the program in the future,” said House Republican Leader Dick Hinch, R-Merrimack.dsolomon@unionleader.com"

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Morse, R-Salem


The Hampstead Area Water Company (HAWC) has already been handed a $300,000 tax bill for the $1 million construction of a new water tank, and is now looking at another $850,000 in taxes for additional components of the major water infrastructure project, according to state Sen. Chuck Morse, R-Salem.Morse called the tax, which went into effect at the start of the year, unfair for the company and ratepayers. He said it could have a chilling effect on companies partnering with the state or municipalities on public utility projects, adding: “This is going to be a problem throughout the state of New Hampshire.”“This project wouldn’t have happened if it wasn’t for Manchester and Derry and Salem and Atkinson letting everyone use their pipes,” Morse said. “The federal government is looking to tax us on a public benefit and that, to me, doesn’t make much sense.”Over the next few years, new pipelines will be built to connect Manchester Water Works through Derry southward to Salem. From Salem, it will connect through the HAWC system in Atkinson, where it will ultimately connect to a brand new drinking water system in Plaistow.HAWC General Manager Charlie Lanza said the new tax liability is the “unfortunate” result of recent changes in tax law.“This is a burden to the Southern NH Regional (Water) Project and will cause additional burden to ratepayers of privately owned public utilities,” Lanza said in an emailed statement. “It’s important that legislators and affected parties bring this to the attention of federal lawmakers. HAWC is actively working on ways to do just this.”Morse said it was hard enough getting the project approved with all the various communities and stakeholders involved, without this additional tax. He said the rates communities are paying for water are just enough to cover operating costs.“There’s no profit baked into this,” Morse said.What’s taxedThe idea behind the federal Contribution In Aid of Construction (CIAC) tax is to tax industries that benefit from government or private donations related to construction. The tax is about 30 percent of the value of a construction project made possible through those donations, Lanza said.State Department of Environmental Services Commissioner Robert Scott said the CIAC tax owes its origins to the 1986 tax reform law, but water utilities became exempt with subsequent legislation in 1996. The 2017 tax reform law lifted that longstanding exemption.Scott said he first became aware of this wrinkle about eight months ago, after the Pennichuck water company was saddled with the tax when it connected homes affected by PFAS contamination with money provided by St. Gobain Performance Plastics in Merrimack.By then, the regional water project was far along in the planning process. Scott said some tax attorneys are currently looking into whether the water project falls under an exemption for projects approved before Dec. 21, 2017, as part of a government’s master development plan.“I’m not sure there’s a great solution in the short-term,” Scott said.Scott said it will likely take an act of Congress to fix the issue in the long term. NH DES has been discussing it with New Hampshire’s congressional delegates, he said.Morse said Gov. Chris Sununu is also aware of his concerns.Grants from the state Drinking Water and Groundwater Trust Fund and the MtBE Settlement Fund are covering the roughly $27 million project.An additional $300,000 loan from the trust fund is covering HAWC’s initial tax liability for constructing the water tank, according to Morse. But that’s only a stop-gap measure.The additional $850,000 in tax liability is due to plans for Salem to build connecting pipes and other system components into HAWC’s system and to later transfer ownership of those pipes to the company.Similarly, infrastructure built in Plaistow in a latter phase of the project will also likely be gifted. HAWC is also tasked with using state funds to convert a number of its existing pumping stations for chloramine treatment.All of the additional costs associated with the tax or any related loan interest are going to be passed on to the ratepayers in Atkinson and Hampstead, which Morse says he can’t abide as a representative of Atkinson.ldnews@unionleader.com"

We are a very politically diverse union. We have Republicans, conservatives, progressives, independents and in that way we are kind of a perfect reflection of the landscape in the country,” Schaitberger said. “Whatever political decisions we have made past or present there will be a section of our membership that will not agree with that decision. We celebrate that, I understand that.”The IAFF became the first union to endorse Biden, announcing it last Monday at the candidate’s first campaign stop in Pittsburgh.President Trump himself signaled how upset the move made him with a two-day tweet storm that included retweets from 60 who identified themselves as IAFF members.“I’ve done more for firefighters than this dues-sucking union will ever do, and I get paid ZERO!” Trump tweeted Wednesday.During a telephone interview, Schaitberger said the choice was nearly four years in the making.“We’ve been thinking about supporting Joe Biden since the late summer of 2015 when we were encouraging him, provoking him to get into the political arena and run back then,” Schaitberger said.After Biden passed on a 2016 run, citing his son Beau’s passing, the union did not endorse anyone in 2016.Schaitberger said Biden has a connection with middle-class voters and a long track record of support for issues important to first responders.As for what to say or do about the Mueller probe and impeachment, Biden hasn’t asked for Schaitberger’s advice.“I’d say stay focused on the issues he believes the American people need to be represented on, bringing civility and decency back into the political arena and talking about how to restore America’s proper place on the international stage,” Schaitberger said.The group has a long history of loyally backing candidates whether they are front-runners or not.In 2003 they got behind then-Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., and chili fest events helped fuel Kerry’s comeback win over former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean.“Maybe we’ll bring back the chili fests for Joe Biden.

We have enough problems and many of us don’t want or need to pay more taxes because of the new people moving in.”Edelblut immediately denounced the posts and said the department was taking “all appropriate and available disciplinary actions.”At the time Governor Chris Sununu said the posts were “unacceptable and wrong.”New Hampshire Democratic Party Chairman Raymond Buckley had called for Schinella’s firing.Pappas to give first commencementU.S. Rep.

We are a very politically diverse union. We have Republicans, conservatives, progressives, independents and in that way we are kind of a perfect reflection of the landscape in the country,"" Schaitberger said. ""Whatever political decisions we have made past or present there will be a section of our membership that will not agree with that decision. We celebrate that, I understand that.""The IAFF became the first union to endorse Biden, announcing it last Monday at the candidate's first campaign stop in Pittsburgh.President Trump himself signaled how upset the move made him with a two-day tweet storm that included retweets from 60 who identified themselves as IAFF members.""I've done more for firefighters than this dues-sucking union will ever do, and I get paid ZERO!"" Trump tweeted Wednesday.During a telephone interview, Schaitberger said the choice was nearly four years in the making.""We've been thinking about supporting Joe Biden since the late summer of 2015 when we were encouraging him, provoking him to get into the political arena and run back then,"" Schaitberger said.After Biden passed on a 2016 run, citing his son Beau's passing, the union did not endorse anyone in 2016.Schaitberger said Biden has a connection with middle-class voters and a long track record of support for issues important to first responders.As for what to say or do about the Mueller probe and impeachment, Biden hasn't asked for Schaitberger's advice.""I'd say stay focused on the issues he believes the American people need to be represented on, bringing civility and decency back into the political arena and talking about how to restore America's proper place on the international stage,"" Schaitberger said.The group has a long history of loyally backing candidates whether they are front-runners or not.In 2003 they got behind then-Sen.

""An extreme example? 1,300 illegal alien Dominican drug dealers moving from Lawrence (Massachusetts) to, say, Concord (New Hampshire) will make the state 1% more diverse ... but it would also bring more crime, higher taxes for public safety.""Schinella added, ""We don't want or need New Hampshire to become any kind of cesspool. We have enough problems and many of us don't want or need to pay more taxes because of the new people moving in.""Edelblut immediately denounced the posts and said the department was taking ""all appropriate and available disciplinary actions.""At the time Governor Chris Sununu said the posts were ""unacceptable and wrong.""New Hampshire Democratic Party Chairman Raymond Buckley had called for Schinella's firing.Potential GOP Senate hopeful way under the radarIn a small state where everything is our business, this potential candidate for major office remains way in the weeds.Bryant S.

Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,"Deal at hand for independent, bipartisan redistricting commission in NH","May 1, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/politics/state/deal-at-hand-for-independent-bipartisan-redistricting-commission-in-nh/article_a5c8f1ac-f75e-5667-94fc-b3ef819a91b6.html,"CONCORD — Republicans and Democrats in the state Legislature have struck a deal on legislation to create an independent redistricting commission to redraw electoral district maps after the 2020 census.The goal is to prevent partisan “gerrymandering,” in which the party in power redraws district lines to benefit its incumbents and new candidates.Republican Sen. James Gray of Rochester and Democratic Rep. Marjorie Smith of Durham unveiled the compromise at a Wednesday hearing before the Senate Election Law Committee on House Bill 706, a redistricting commission bill that cleared the House in late February.Only 16 Republicans joined all Democrats in supporting the bill. Since then, however, Gray and Smith appear to have come up with something that both parties can support.“This will stand as one of the best pieces of legislation we have done in this state and one of the best examples in the country of how to go about the business of taking the partisanship out of the important political process of choosing legislative districts,” Smith told the committee.Afterward, she commended Sen. Regina Birdsell, R-Hampstead, who has taken the lead for Republicans in the Senate on election-related issues.“Sen. Birdsell wanted to see if we could get to ‘Yes,’ and I was delighted because I have said all along that this is not a partisan issue, and this is an ideal time to try to accomplish this goal,” said Smith.“We spent six hours over two days identifying ways to make the bill better, and I believe the amendment now before the Senate Election Law Committee is better.”Simplified languageThe amendment simplifies what had been a cumbersome process for selecting commission members in the original bill. The bill, as it passed the House, called for a large pool of applicants screened by the Secretary of State, permitting leading lawmakers to use a process akin to jury selection to disqualify a certain number.That was replaced by a provision that calls on the Senate and House leaders from the majority and minority parties to each choose five members. Those 10 are then empowered to select another five who are not members of either party.A plan must receive support from at least nine of the 15 commissioners, and then must be ratified by the state Legislature. If the Legislature fails to ratify the plan, a petition will be filed with the state Supreme Court, which will be empowered to appoint a special master whose maps will take effect.“We recognize that there might unfortunately come a time for the courts to become involved,” said Smith.New Hampshire lawmakers are taking the lead on an issue that has been advanced in other states by voter referendum, something not allowed in the Granite State.Yurij Rudensky, redistricting expert with the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law, made the trip to New Hampshire to testify for the bill and commend lawmakers for their initiative.“We couldn’t be more excited about how this process came together and the product that it has yielded,” he said. “I think by passing this bill, New Hampshire would become a national leader in terms of the types of systems that promote the core values of American democracy.”


            State's effort to address gerrymandering attracts national attention


            Senate passes bills to create independent redistricting process, encourage student votingA turning point?In 2018, voters in five states — Colorado, Michigan, Missouri, Ohio and Utah — approved reforms to limit extremely partisan gerrymandering, the Brennan Center reported on Feb. 28, “but the New Hampshire bill could mark a turning point for states that don’t have a ballot initiative process.”Despite such accolades, the bill still has a long way to go. The amended version will have to come out of committee, with a vote expected this Wednesday. Then it will have to be approved in the full Senate, go back to the House, and be signed into law by Gov. Chris Sununu.Sununu has previously said he sees no urgency about changing the current system, but he did not go so far as to promise a veto. On Wednesday, he softened that stance even further.“I’ll see where the final bill ends up,” he said. “The initial bill they put forward was incredibly complex. It was well-intended but not very practical in how it was implemented, but where the final bill ends up ... we’ll be interested in taking a look,” said Sununu.Fifty-seven people signed in to support the bill at the Wednesday hearing, while one person signed in as opposed, but did not testify.Opponents of the legislation as it was originally proposed warned that it violated the state constitution, which clearly gives redistricting powers to the Legislature.When Birdsell raised that concern on Wednesday, Rudensky pointed out that the bill calls upon the Legislature to appoint commission members and approve the maps afterward.“Any state constitutional concerns should be addressed by those provisions,” he said.dsolomon@unionleader.com"
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,Getting real with DCYF: Unrealistic number isn't helping,"May 1, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/opinion/editorials/getting-real-with-dcyf-unrealistic-number-isn-t-helping/article_382db27f-301f-5dac-a1bc-c702d8a5c9f4.html,"Goals can be good things to strive for but when they are completely unrealistic they are meaningless and in fact can do real harm. Such is the plan being put forth by legislators for the Division of Children, Youth, and Families.It calls for the funding of 77 more DCYF positions, including 57 new caseworkers and 20 new supervisors. That’s a huge jump from the current budgeted caseworker number.But here’s the problem, or at least one of them. Not all of the current positions are filled. DCYF was given 33 new positions in the last budget. It can’t fill them all. Legislators may not have heard, but there is a labor shortage, in New Hampshire and across the nation.What is the point of creating more and more positions when there is simply no way they will be filled?One sentence from Tuesday’s Union Leader story on the matter explains it. “Democrats have seized on the issue in an attempt to portray Sununu as unresponsive to a child protection crisis.”That would be Gov. Chris Sununu, whose own budget authorizes 62 new positions but funds 26 (in the hopes that somehow qualified individuals can be found for those 26, plus the ones already unfilled).It is Sununu who is being responsive, and responsible, on the child protection issue that, like many things, has been exacerbated by the opioid crisis. Legislators should back off their unrealistic numbers and work with the governor on this one."

Any time the government enforces a mandatory levy against your wages it is an income tax.When is a lie not a lie?Also, never.Whenever the Democrats in Concord tell you that a mandatory “premium on wages” from which you have no opportunity to opt out is not an income tax, they are lying.Sen. Dan Feltes is leading the charge on this latest income tax lie.Senate Bill 1, the Democrat-sponsored, mandatory paid family-leave plan, is clearly and indisputably an income tax.It is a mandatory participation, no opt-out, 0.5% tax against the wages of every single worker in New Hampshire.What’s more, there are no limits on how often or how much the state could raise that 0.5% income tax in the future.Gov. Chris Sununu, like most Republicans, Democrats and Independents across the state, agrees that paid family medical leave is a win-win proposition that promotes healthy work-life balance and is often the only way that families can take care of loved ones in times of medical crisis.Sununu has offered an innovative, viable plan that will work … without implementing an income tax. He has teamed up with Vermont Gov. Phil Scott to create a truly voluntary, opt-in paid leave plan that does not require mandatory levies against your wages.You decide.You get to evaluate your family’s needs, you get to evaluate your income, you get to evaulate the plan, and then you — the person working to earn the money — get to decide how you spend it.Too good to be true, you say?Wrong.Here is how it works: The states of New Hampshire and Vermont would pay for — at no cost to workers — a paid leave benefit for their state employees.By leveraging the buying power of the two states and their roughly 18,000 state employees, the two states would contract with a private insurer through a competitive RFP process to offer paid leave. Thanks to such a large base pool of state employees, the prices would be competitive and low-cost.Due to an already established base pool, private employers would then be able to purchase this same paid leave insurance for their own employees.If a private employer chose not to offer a paid leave benefit for their employees, any private-sector employee in New Hampshire would be free to purchase their own paid family-leave insurance from the same private insurer.So even if an employer chooses not to buy it for their employees, anyone — literally anyone — could choose to buy it on their own.It’s so simple, so honest and so effective you have to wonder why the Democrats in Concord have a problem with it to begin with.That answer is pretty simple, too. They hate it ‘cuz they ain’t it.That is to say, an already popular Republican governor came up with a smart idea that solves a problem for New Hampshire people in a manner that is right for New Hampshire and they just can’t stand it.In fact, the way the Democrats are acting here is exactly what is so wrong with politics today.They oppose it simply because the other side thought of it.Never mind that it saves you money, provides a service, empowers the individual and avoids additional government intrusion in your life.They will fight it tooth and nail for the purpose of trying to undermine a political opponent in the next election.Even though they know that doing so hurts you.Their position lacks integrity and principle.They are wrong and they know they are wrong.Let’s make sure that when the next election rolls around, we show them that we know they are wrong too."
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,Lawmakers at odds over how to cover costs of animal abuse cases,"Apr 30, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/politics/state/lawmakers-at-odds-over-how-to-cover-costs-of-animal/article_7133f7b7-5dd6-5614-941a-bf9f5d583177.html,"CONCORD — State Sen. Jeb Bradley, R-Wolfeboro, can rattle off the names of New Hampshire towns recently involved in costly animal abuse cases without hesitation — Wolfeboro, Croydon, Berlin, Marlborough, Exeter, Bristol.In the past two years those towns have faced the prospect of thousands of dollars in unanticipated costs to house, shelter and otherwise care for animals confiscated in high-profile cases of animal abuse or neglect, most involving dogs.In most cases, the local humane society or animal shelters stepped in and with help from donations enabled the towns to avoid budget-busting expenses, but that’s not likely to continue.Bradley has been working with stakeholders for the past two years in an attempt to address the situation. The House and Senate reached an impasse on the issue last year, and still appear to be deeply divided.Members of the House Environment and Agriculture Committee on Tuesday voted 18-1 to approve an amendment to one of Bradley’s bills, SB 77.The House amendment would create a Cost of Care Fund “to assist municipalities in covering the costs of care incurred from caring for animals pending the resolution of any action brought for animal cruelty.”The fund would be financed by taking 50 cents from every dog license issued by a municipality, combined with 50 percent of the registration fees collected by the state from distributors of commercial animal feed.“We felt this 50 cents the towns would be contributing would be giving them an insurance policy they could draw from,” said committee member Howard Pearl, R-Loudon. “That was the original intent of the dog licensing fees, but most towns are just putting it into their general fund.”Rep. Jane Beaulieu, D-Manchester, was the only committee member to vote against the amendment, citing the “downshifting” of costs to municipalities.Avoiding a vetoThe committee had originally considered adding 50 cents to dog licensing fees, and taking it back for the Cost of Care Fund, but the prospect of a veto by Gov. Chris Sununu, who promised no new fees or taxes, put an end to that line of thinking.“We didn’t want the bill to go down because of a 50-cent increase, and we feel that the 50 cents the towns will be contributing will give them something to lean on if they get a cruelty case in their town,” said Pearl.The commissioner of agriculture would be required to develop rules and regulations for the fund, which would generate about $1 million. The proposed legislation specifies that the maximum amount of aid per application would be $500,000.Rep. Peter Bixby, D-Dover, vice-chair of the House agriculture committee, said he was confident that the House and Senate would be able to strike a deal this year, but Bradley is not so sure. He said the addition of the Cost of Care Fund by the full House could be a deal-breaker.“I never agreed to that,” Bradley said. “When we first talked they were going to increase fees by 50 cents and I said ‘no.’ I also didn’t agree to taking it away from municipalities. The Municipal Association is very opposed.”Proponents of the fund are stuck between municipalities, who don’t want to see their revenue from dog licenses reduced, and a governor who has pledged to veto any new taxes or fees. Cities and towns collect anywhere from $4.50 to $9 per license, depending on the number of animals and whether or not they are spayed or neutered.“We would have had no problem with increasing the license fees 50 cents and sending that amount to the state,” said Cordell Johnston, government affairs counsel for the New Hampshire Municipal Association. “But taking it out of the existing fees is not acceptable.”Several recent casesThe association favors the bill as it was passed by the Senate, with no Cost of Care Fund.“SB 77 clarifies the obligation of the animal’s owner to post a bond for the costs of care and enhances the municipality’s ability to draw from the bond. This certainly won’t ensure full reimbursement in all cases, but it should help,” said Johnston.The effort to deal with cost of care acquired some urgency after the widely publicized case of breeder Christina Fay, who was convicted by a judge in 2017 on animal cruelty charges six months after more than 80 Great Danes were removed from her Wolfeboro home.Also in 2017, a 48-year-old Croydon woman was sentenced to six months in jail after being convicted of more than a dozen animal cruelty charges, and Berlin police arrested a local couple on 44 counts of animal cruelty after seizing 15 dogs and a cat from their home on Jericho Road.In 2018, officials at the New Hampshire Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in Stratham took in 21 abandoned animals after residents were evicted in Exeter, and a Bristol woman pleaded not guilty to 20 animal cruelty charges that allege she kept German shepherds in a frigid Alexandria barn. That case ended in a mistrial.A Marlborough man accused of keeping dozens of Labrador retrievers in filthy conditions at his home was found guilty in February of misdemeanor animal cruelty involving 52 dogs and a cat.dsolomon@unionleader.com"

Many of the details, including how the massive plan will be funded, must still be worked out.See related story, Page B1.Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., praised the first steps and urged her fellow lawmakers to focus on internet access.“There’s a severe lack of access to broadband internet, particularly in rural areas of New Hampshire, that is holding back local economies, and I’m glad the issue was included in today’s discussion,” she said in a statement. “It’s now time to put aside petty politics and invest in projects that are critical to public safety and the future of our economy. I will continue to work across the aisle to deliver bipartisan infrastructure legislation to the President’s desk.”Rep. Annie Kuster added her own support to the effort.“The safety of our nation’s roads, bridges, waterways, and water treatment infrastructure should not be a partisan issue,” she said. “Investing in our nation’s infrastructure including expanding rural broadband is about ensuring public safety and our economic competitiveness.”A survey of New Hampshire businesses conducted in 2017 and 2018 by the Broadband Center of Excellence at UNH found that only 55 percent of responding businesses believed their internet speeds were sufficient.The rate was even lower among small businesses and in industries where employees tend to work from home or remotely.Last year, Gov. Chris Sununu signed into law a bill allowing communities in under-connected areas to issue bonds to fund broadband improvements.“We’d welcome any efforts that expand private sector telecommunications infrastructure throughout the state to improve access, quality and reliability,” said Kevin Flynn, a spokesman for the Business and Industry Association of New Hampshire. “Businesses in rural areas need that kind of access to thrive and expand. We’re equally concerned about transportation infrastructure. We need safe, well-maintained roads and bridges to move goods and accommodate commuting workers. Federal transportation aid to the state is a critical component.”The plan discussed by Trump and Democrats on Tuesday focused on $1.5 trillion in new spending on infrastructure over the coming decade but relied heavily on states, localities and the private sector to cover the costs.A plan released earlier by Senate Democrats would have relied far more heavily on direct federal government spending than Trump’s plan. The president’s plan included $200 billion in federal spending with the aim of enticing several times that amount from other levels of government.Both Schumer and Pelosi characterized the meeting with Trump as productive, and Pelosi said she is hopeful Democrats can work with the White House despite friction over ongoing congressional investigations of the administration.“We cannot ignore the needs of the American people as we go forward,” she said.Yet the issue of paying for a plan looms incredibly large.Schumer told reporters that Trump did not rule out tax increases — an idea many Republicans are loath to embrace, especially with an election around the corner — but offered no specifics.“The ball is in their court,” Schumer said. “We told him that, it was repeated over and over again, that unless he is willing to come up with the pay-fors for this large package, it will never get done, and he agreed. And so we agreed to meet in three weeks, the same group, and they would present what their pay-fors would be, and I thought that was encouraging.”Before the meeting, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway told reporters that Trump had not endorsed the idea of paying for infrastructure with an increase in the federal gas tax, a move backed by some Democrats and business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.“There are many different ways to pay for it,” she said. “You could have private-public partnerships. I know the Democrats will want to raise taxes. They want to raise taxes for everything.”Democrats have suggested paying for infrastructure by rolling back the Republican tax cuts that Trump signed into law in 2017.Before the meeting, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney cast doubt on whether a deal could be cut with Democrats.“I hope that negotiations go well today, but if they don’t, it would not surprise me,” Mulvaney said, adding that he thinks there’s a greater likelihood of a revamped trade deal with Canada and Mexico passing Congress than an infrastructure plan."
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,GOP lawmakers split with Sununu on DCYF funding,"Apr 29, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/politics/state/gop-lawmakers-split-with-sununu-on-dcyf-funding/article_51e52ec9-ebc8-5a11-a5a3-fba40b34c19f.html,"CONCORD — Republicans in the state Legislature are poised to support Gov. Chris Sununu in a pitched battle with Democrats over the state budget, with only weeks to go before the current spending plan expires on June 30.But when it comes to spending on child protection, Republicans in the House and Senate are parting ways with the governor, as they line up behind legislation co-sponsored by 13 of the 14 Senate Democrats and the chair of the powerful House Finance Committee.“This bill delivers on one of the most fundamental responsibilities government has to its people: protecting its most vulnerable population, abused and neglected children,” said Sen. Jon Morgan, D-Brentwood, prime sponsor of Senate Bill 6.The bill passed the Senate, 23-0, in February, and on Thursday will go to the House floor with a 16-0 endorsement from the House Children and Family Law Committee.It funds 77 new positions in the Division for Children, Youth and Families over two years at a cost of $8.6 million, consisting of 57 new child protective service workers (CPSW) and 20 new supervisors.The 57 new case workers represent a 44-percent increase over the current staffing at DCYF, which has 129 existing protective service worker positions.“What are we really trying to achieve with this bill? We’re attempting to set the path for child protection in New Hampshire for the next 10 years,” according to Rebecca Woitkowski, early childhood policy coordinator for New Futures’ Kids Count. “We are trying to avoid the mistakes we’ve made in the past 10 years.”In her written testimony on behalf of SB 6, Woitkowski goes on to say, “This is not the final piece of the puzzle, but this bill is unbelievably important. It is our best chance to protect New Hampshire’s children and keep them safe as we go forward.”Sununu’s version of the state budget would authorize 62 new DCYF positions, but pay for only 26. More could be funded as the agency fills its current openings and the 26 new positions.Democrats have seized on the issue in an attempt to portray Sununu as unresponsive to a child protection crisis. At a recent State House news conference, Democratic lawmakers were joined by a DCYF case worker and a former client of DCYF services in pressing for the Senate bill. Also speaking at that event was Dr. Lawrence Shulman of Grantham, chairman of the DCYF Advisory Board.“The small increase in DCYF staff that Gov. Sununu is proposing is not sufficient to meet the need for either child protection interventions or ongoing family support services,” he said.The agency has been struggling to fill the 33 new positions authorized in the current two-year budget, amid a high turnover rate for new hires. Despite the new positions and increased appropriations for 2018-2019, workforce problems persist. From September 2018 to February 2019, open assessments increased from 3,329 to 4,126; the vacancy rate in child protective worker positions has gone from 14 to 19 percent; and the average number of open assessments per case worker (which should be 12 to 15 according to national standards) has gone from 34 to 45.“A high caseload is probably the single most influencing factor in caseworker turnover,” says Emily Lawrence, associate director with the Office of the Child Advocate.“From the child’s point of view, this is problematic on several levels … The calls that affect the Child Advocate Office the most are calls that come in from the children themselves. These are heartbreaking. Children should not be making excuses for the failures of an under-resourced state system.”For now, Sununu remains convinced that the more frugal path is to see how many positions DCYF can fill before putting more money on the table.“This legislation (SB 6) seeks to build upon the progress we made with child welfare reform in 2018 and rebuilding our child welfare system has been a priority since day one,” he said in a statement on Monday. “I continue to believe we need to put more front-line workers in the field to protect our most vulnerable children, and will review the final language of the bill should it reach my desk.”dsolomon@unionleader.com"

Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,Beyond the Stigma: New program helps nurses struggling with addiction,"Apr 27, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/stigma/beyond-the-stigma-new-program-helps-nurses-struggling-with-addiction/article_e9792080-40a2-5ba9-8573-8642822b3320.html,"For the past 17 years, nursing has been ranked the most honest and ethical profession in an annual Gallup survey. But what happens when a nurse loses that trust because of substance abuse?In New Hampshire, a new program encourages nurses to self-report if they are impaired by alcohol or drug abuse. When they do, they’ll be referred to treatment, and their recovery will be monitored even after they return to duty. Proponents say it’s a way to protect patient safety, help nurses struggling with addiction and retain talented professionals in the face of a critical nursing shortage.Last year, lawmakers here authorized the state Board of Nursing to establish an “alternative recovery monitoring program.”Joan Widmer is nurse executive director of the New Hampshire Nurses Association, which supported the legislation. “We felt that this was the right thing to do,” she said.











Addressing substance abuse in health care professions is a balancing act between protecting patient safety and getting someone the treatment they need, Widmer said. Substance use disorder, she said, “is a medical condition, just like diabetes and heart disease, and we need to help nurses who, because of the nature of the work, are in contact with substances that can lead to addiction.”The New Hampshire Board of Nursing licenses approximately 26,000 nurses, including registered nurses (RNs), advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs) and licensed practical nurses (LPNs), as well as 13,500 licensed nursing assistants (LNAs). Experts say up to 10 percent of nurses could be at risk for substance abuse.Denise Nies, administrator of the Board of Nursing, estimates that 150 to 200 nurses have been disciplined for issues related to substance use disorders over the past five years. She said the new law not only encourages nurses to self-report but also allows the board to refer nurses involved in a disciplinary complaint to the alternative program. The board has drafted rules for the new program, with a public hearing set for May 23.The way the law was written, nurses who are impaired due to a mental or physical illness can also apply for the program. But supporters say the primary intent is to help nurses struggling with addiction.Nurses can face termination and loss of license when it’s discovered they have a substance abuse problem, Widmer said. “Now you lose your ability to earn an income,” she said. “You’re just going to spiral down.”The alternative recovery monitoring program, she said, “is designed so that we can treat the issue in a nonpenalty environment, while preserving the nurse’s license.”“We want to do all that we can to remove the stigma, get them care, get them treated and then keep them in the workforce,” Widmer said.Diverting drugs from patientsThe problem of drug diversion in health care became front-page news in New Hampshire in 2012, after a traveling medical technician working at Exeter Hospital caused an outbreak of Hepatitis C among patients there. David Kwaitkowski, who was infected with the virus, admitted to stealing fentanyl meant for patients and replacing the medication with tainted syringes filled with saline. He pleaded guilty in 2013 and was sentenced to 39 years in prison.The case shined a spotlight on drug diversion in health care settings and made prevention a critical priority for hospitals here and nationwide.Widmer, a former emergency room nurse, said despite all the new safeguards in place, diversion of medication remains a problem. “Hospital systems go to great lengths to make sure that doesn’t happen, but where there’s a will, there’s a way,” she said. “We all know opioid addiction is this very powerful motivator, which is why getting off the drugs is so hard. It’s not a short-term problem; it’s a lifelong disease.”













Surrounded by representatives of the nursing profession, Gov. Chris Sununu signed a law last June to create an alternative recovery monitoring program for nurses licensed by the state Board of Nursing. Among the nurses celebrating the change was Sandra Pascucci, third from right, a retired nurse who has run peer support groups for nurses with substance use disorders for 25 years.

Making it easier to come forwardThat’s why encouraging nurses to self-report in the early stages of addiction is critical, she said. “You want them to recognize their own problem and feel comfortable that they can come forward and address the problem without loss of licensing and a way of making a living,” Widmer said. “That’s the bottom line.”Under the proposed rules, licensed nurses may be admitted to the alternative recovery monitoring program either on a voluntary basis, or an involuntary basis if required as part of a disciplinary process. Each participant must sign a contract agreeing to abstain from alcohol and drugs and to cease practice in their field until approved to return to work.An individualized treatment plan will be designed for each participant, including at least a year of after-care. Nurses agree to attend weekly 12-step and peer support groups; submit to random drug or alcohol testing; and report any prescriptions for opiates as well as over-the-counter medications.Admission to the program can be denied if a nurse has diverted controlled substances or caused “known provable harm” to patients.The monitoring period lasts three to five years, continuing after a nurse is allowed to return to duty. The nurse is not allowed to administer controlled substances for a minimum of six months after returning to work and cannot work unsupervised or have full access to controlled substances for at least a year.Sandra Pascucci is a retired nurse who has run peer support groups for nurses in recovery for 25 years.The people she’s met in those groups over the years, she said, “are often the best nurses you’d ever want.”Widmer credits Pascucci, who is 78, as one of the driving forces behind the new alternative recovery monitoring program. And Pascucci was on hand when Gov. Chris Sununu signed it into law last June.Reasons nurses are susceptiblePascucci said there are complex reasons why nurses can be susceptible to substance abuse. “Nurses work long hours and they’re in very, very stressful situations,” she said. It’s also a physically taxing job, and nurses can suffer pain and neck injuries, which can lead to use and eventual misuse of prescription painkillers, she said.In fact, Widmer said, back injuries are as prevalent among nurses as among construction workers. She said the physical and emotional toll of the work, combined with proximity and access to medications, can lead to alcohol or drug use. “It’s a way of coping with the stress of the job,” she said.Pascucci, who has been in recovery from alcoholism since 1986, said the stigma around addiction is especially strong for those in health care professions. But she said she’s “cautiously optimistic” that the state’s investments in treatment and recovery, such as the hub-and-spoke treatment program and the recovery-friendly workplace initiative, will pay off.Shortly after the new law passed last year, the state Board of Nursing awarded Recovery Trek in Virginia a one-year contract to monitor nurses here, even before the rules for the program were written. The board recently issued a request for proposals to run the program under the forthcoming rules after that contract expires in July, and is currently reviewing submissions.As of last month, only three nurses have received services through Recovery Trek, according to Bonnie Crumley Aybar, education program specialist for LPNs and RNs at the board. Another nurse recently enrolled by self-reporting, and there were three additional inquiries about the program, she said.Widmer said she hopes the new program will help nurses feel more comfortable acknowledging that they have a problem and asking for help.“I don’t think you’re ever going to see substance use disorder disappear in the nursing population; it’s going to be there,” she said. “But if you can at least address it and find a way to do it in a non-stigmatic way, you’re going to keep patients safer, because nurses are going to self-report.“That’s really the long goal,” she said."

Chris Sununu blasted key parts of the Democrats’ agenda in the state Legislature and said his veto pen was at the ready. He’s going to need a lot of ink in that pen.When all is said and done, Sununu could easily beat the record for vetoes since 1997, currently held by former Gov. John Lynch.Lynch enjoyed Democratic majorities in both House and Senate from 2007 to 2010, but in the Tea Party election of November 2010, Republicans rode a national wave to veto-proof, two-thirds majorities in both chambers.Over the two-year session of 2011 and 2012, Lynch vetoed 28 bills. Despite sizable majorities for the GOP in both chambers, 14 of those vetoes were sustained, illustrating the power of the veto pen. And that doesn’t count the state budget that Lynch allowed to become law without his signature.











Sununu isn’t even facing veto-proof majorities, as Lynch did, and so is more likely to see his vetoes upheld.Vetoes can definitely be expected on a basket of bills Democrats expect to put on Sununu’s desk regarding gun control and election law, as well as renewable energy legislation that Sununu has already vetoed in the past. Add to that death penalty repeal, family medical leave, marijuana legalization and changes to the work requirement for certain Medicaid recipients.The governor has already warned that the House version of the state budget for 2020-21, now working its way through the Senate, will be vetoed unless the Senate makes substantial changes.A couple dozen bills have already passed the Legislature, but are sitting on the desk of House Speaker or Senate President awaiting submission to the governor for his consideration. They include SB 1, the Democrats’ signature campaign issue and policy initiative for 2019 — paid family medical leave.That bill was fast-tracked with a speed rarely seen in Concord, clearing the Senate on Feb. 4 and the House on March 20, mostly along party lines. More than a month later, it has yet to resurface.Betting odds are good that Democrats would like to hit Sununu with an override before he starts to chalk up a series of sustained vetoes, so watch for death penalty repeal, HB 455, to be the first bill Sununu sees. It passed by veto-proof majorities and a successful override looks likely.After that, the flood-gates could open.For those keeping score, former Gov. Maggie Hassan, who had to deal with Republican majorities in 2015 and 2016, issued 26 vetoes, all but three upheld.Former Gov. Jeanne Shaheen appears to have had the most bipartisan success in recent history. Dealing with Republican legislative majorities in 2002 and 2003, she issued 21 vetoes, all of which were upheld.‘Grow your own’While full legalization of recreational use of marijuana by adults is headed for a certain veto, should it pass the Senate, prospects are better for a bill allowing home cultivation of therapeutic cannabis.HB 364 passed the House on a voice vote in March and heads for the Senate on Thursday, with a 3-2 “ought-to-pass” recommendation from the Senate Health and Human Services Committee.The bill allows cultivation of up to three mature cannabis plants, three immature plants and 12 seedlings, out of public view, by patients in the therapeutic cannabis program or an authorized caregiver.DCYF on ‘Laurie List’Officials at the Division for Children, Youth and Families no doubt took notice of a judge’s ruling on Tuesday that names on the “Laurie List” — the secret list of New Hampshire law enforcement officers with credibility problems — are subject to disclosure.The judge didn’t order the names released, and the Attorney General’s office appears determined to fight against that, perhaps all the way to the state Supreme Court.The redacted version of the list available to the public has the names blacked out, but does disclose the agency or department involved. It consists almost entirely of state, county and local law enforcement, with a few corrections officers as well.But the most recent version of the list, updated on April 11, also cites a DCYF employee involved in the juvenile justice system as having a problem with “truthfulness,” in a notification dated March 3, 2019.dsolomon@unionleader.com"

It began with an outhouse on top and later a car was added. Spectators would stay until the end to see the car come down.Many residents and out-of-towners who grew up attending the annual bonfire hoped there would be a way to bring it back, even if it’s only for this year.“There’s a whole generation of kids who have grown up and have never seen it,” said Rich St. Hilaire, a member of the Kingston Volunteer Fire Association, which is organizing the event.













A bonfire with a junk car sitting on top was a tradition in Kingston for many years.


Larry Kennedy/Carriage Towne News 


Getting a burn permit for an ordinary bonfire wouldn’t have been a problem, but adding a car today isn’t as simple as it was years ago because of more stringent environmental rules.Fire Chief Bill Seaman said the issue was brought to the attention of the state Department of Environmental Services, which only allows a vehicle to be burned for firefighter training.State Rep. Ken Weyler, R-Kingston, sponsored House Bill 167, which recently passed the House and Senate and is expected to be signed by Gov. Chris Sununu.The legislation gives the town permission to hold a one-time bonfire with the car on top for the anniversary. It will be held along the Kingston Plains on Main Street.Seaman said the car will be stripped of its interior, transmission, tires and other mechanical parts and will have all fluids drained.The only pollutant of concern that will remain is the paint, but Craig Wright, director of the Air Resources Division at DES, has told officials that he has no concerns about the bonfire with the precautions the town is taking.Weyler remembers watching the bonfire in the 1980s.“We know it was a great event and I don’t think any other town was doing it. We look at it as part of our history and we’re getting it back. I think we all recognize that this is a special event,” he said.Kevin St. James, the event’s co-chairman, moved to Kingston in 1994 and never had a chance to see the bonfire, but he’s heard a lot about it from people who attended.“Everyone tells me about the bonfires when they were a kid. I wanted to see it happen at least once in my lifetime,” he said.St. James worked with the fire department to figure out a way to make it happen.“We’re just trying to hold a nostalgic event that everyone can enjoy,” he said.Other events planned on June 29 include a beer tasting festival, cow patty contest, road race and fireworks, followed by the bonfire shortly after 9 p.m. More information can be found at https://www.facebook.com/Kingstonbrewfest/.RockinghamNews@unionleader.com"

Personally, one of my biggest worries is the day my parents’ health care needs become my responsibility. This is why I strongly support bringing paid family and medical leave to the great state of New Hampshire via Senate Bill 1 (SB1), and why I’m urging Gov. Chris Sununu to sign SB1 into law.SB1, a bipartisan piece of legislation that has been approved by the N.H. Senate and House, will provide New Hampshire’s workforce with access to 12 weeks of paid leave at up to 60 percent of their salary in order to help employees tend to the needs of a sick family member or their own illness, and with the birth/adoption of a child. SB1 will help build/maintain New Hampshire’s young workforce, allow for new parents to bond with their children, and provide the hard-working citizens of our state with the sense of security they so desperately deserve when dealing with an illness within their family.Overall, SB1 is an affordable solution that will help bring paid family and medical leave to New Hampshire for all residents. I hope Gov. Sununu reconsiders his initial thoughts about vetoing SB1, and signs the bill into law instead.TEMPESTT JONESGoffstown"

Jeanne Shaheen in 2020.But at least they’ve got some in the GOP willing to take a look at it.Most observers don’t think Gov. Chris Sununu will pass on seeking a third term as chief executive next year, and will instead take a flyer on trying to take out New Hampshire’s senior senator.Then there’s former House Speaker Bill O’Brien of Nashua, who’s seriously exploring a campaign and continues to meet with state and national GOP figures about the idea.We also have New London venture capitalist Jay Lucas. He hasn’t ruled out a 2020 run, but over the past year is singularly focused on his project to revitalize his native hometown of Newport.Now there’s somebody different and he’s very intriguing.Retired Brig. Gen. Donald Bolduc is by no means close to making a decision, but several GOP sources have said he’s listening to folks who think he’d be a great candidate.By any measure, the Laconia native resident is an authentic American hero.He’s one of the soldiers depicted in “12 Strong,” a movie about a horseback-riding Special Forces team that fought the Taliban in Afghanistan soon after the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001.Bolduc’s decorated career included serving as commander of special operations command in Africa and 32 years of service, during which he received two awards for valor, five Bronze Star medals, 10 deployments and two Purple Hearts.He became a national evangelist for helping soldiers who were dealing with brain injuries and mental health problems.Bolduc came to grips with the fact he had suffered from post traumatic stress disorder.Bolduc has been a member of the Juvenile Parole Board, adjunct professor at Southern New Hampshire University and an adviser to several organizations that supported wounded veterans, deployed troops and children at risk.Bolduc resides in Stratham and he and his wife, Sharon, have three sons and three grandchildren.Hassan trip agendaSen. Maggie Hassan, D-NH, spent several days this week traveling with Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., to Japan, South Korea and China, where they met to discuss the U.S.-South Korea alliance and efforts to denuclearize the peninsula.The senators met with young people who had defected from North Korea and learned English with the help of U.S. government exchange programs.In a statement Hassan, a member of the Senate Homeland Security and Finance Committees, stressed the goal has to continue to be to get North Korea to abandon its nuclear ambitions.“President Trump did the right thing walking away from a deal at Hanoi without getting serious, concrete offers and specifics that would help guide us to the next stage of a denuclearization agreement and so it was very important that the President recognized no deal was better than a bad deal,” Hassan said.“We all understand that when you enter complex negotiations between parties that have long been not only at a distance, but have created mistrust for each other, that you need to do things to build confidence. But to suggest that relieving sanctions before there is denuclearization, I think it’s not something that people in the United States would support.”Shaheen sets 2020 agenda; prez candidates in stateOn Monday while five major Democratic candidates were in the state for town hall forums, Sen. Shaheen wrote to all the 2020 hopefuls to enlist them to get behind overturning a GOP-led state law that requires new voters be notified of obligations to register a car or get a driver’s license once they vote here.“Here where the first-in-the-nation Presidential Primary makes voting a special responsibility, a new voter suppression law means tens of thousands of young people could lose their right to vote. They are being disenfranchised by photo ID requirements, arbitrary challenges to residency, and unfounded allegations of fraud,” Shaheen wrote in her letter.“I am asking every candidate for President to stand up for these students, condemning these tactics and protecting the integrity of New Hampshire’s voting process by signing a petition publicly denouncing this voter suppression law.”It had the desired effect.Only two days later, 16 candidates had endorsed the letter, including Sens. Kamala Harris, Bernie Sanders, Amy Klobuchar, Kirsten Gillibrand, Cory Booker and Elizabeth Warren along with Reps.

This is a serious matter in our country. We need leaders to lead, and they have failed to have the courage.”Meanwhile the Los Angeles Times and Daily Beast were among media outlets that over the past week returned to speculation Harris isn’t focusing on New Hampshire as much as other major hopefuls.“It is very important for me to be here,” Harris told reporters in Keene. “I intend on coming back frequently and making it a significant time when I’m here.”Border congressman coming to NHExecutive Councilor Russell and Susan Prescott are hosting at their Kingston home a fundraiser Friday, May 3.

Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,Laurie List: Judge says names of errant NH cops are public record,"Apr 24, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/courts/laurie-list-judge-says-names-of-errant-nh-cops-are/article_3e7e98f5-0250-5e2d-8908-e4a06c7481ee.html,"A judge ruled on Tuesday that names on the “Laurie List” — the secret list of New Hampshire police officers with credibility problems — do not qualify for confidentiality protections under state law and are subject to disclosure.In a 12-page order, Superior Court Judge Charles Temple rejected a request by New Hampshire Attorney General Gordon MacDonald to dismiss a court case by the New Hampshire Union Leader, American Civil Liberties Union, and other media to force disclosure of the list.But Temple did not order the Laurie List, which has about 260 names on it, disclosed, carefully limiting his ruling to a denial of an Attorney General’s request to dismiss the media and ACLU case.“We are pleased with the court’s order and the ball is now in the Department of Justice’s court in terms of reconsideration and appeal,” said Gregory Sullivan, the lawyer representing the Union Leader.In a statement released several hours after Temple’s order, Solicitor General Dan Will stressed that Temple did not order the immediate production of the list, known formally as the Exculpatory Evidence Schedule.“The Court’s order is not a final order in the case and, therefore, is not subject to immediate appeal to the New Hampshire Supreme Court. We are reviewing the order. We will make a determination about next steps consistent with court procedure,” Will wrote.He will likely have to speak with Gov. Chris Sununu. In a statement, Sununu spokesman Benjamin Vihstadt said Sununu is reviewing the decision and will discuss its potential impact with MacDonald’s office.Since 2005, New Hampshire prosecutors have kept lists of police officers with credibility problems. They do so because prosecutors must inform defense lawyers if an officer with credibility problems is going to testify during a trial.Eventually, a statewide list was centralized in the Attorney General’s office. The Attorney General has released redacted versions of the list that keep the identity of the officers secret while identifying the departments in most cases and a brief summary of the transgressions.Earlier this year, the Union Leader, the ACLU and five other media organizations sued for access to the entire list.On Wednesday, ACLU Legal Affairs Director Gilles Bissonnette called the order a victory and said the list should be released.“This order has the effect of being a final decision in the case. Our position is the document has to be produced. It’s a public record. It belongs to the public,” he said.ACLU Executive Director Devon Chaffee said: “Granite Staters have proven time and again that they demand transparency from their government, and today’s victory is another step in the right direction.In his order, Temple said the list could not be considered a personnel record; personnel records are exempt under the Right to Know Law and the law that establishes the Laurie List.He noted that that the Attorney General does not hire, fire, discipline, evaluate or take any other actions of an employer.“Because the officers listed on the (Exculpatory Evidence Schedule) do not share an employee-employer relationship with the Department of Justice, and the EES lacks any type of employer or human relations function, the Court finds the EES is not a personnel file” under state law.Temple’s order borrows heavily from many of the arguments that Bissonnette and Sullivan voiced during a hearing in February.It’s now up to the lawyers on the prevailing side to ask the judge for a final order. If that order is issued, Will could file an appeal to the state Supreme Court.mhayward@unionleader.com"

Then it started affecting his sleep; then he became addicted to it and the lifestyle. It caused him to never leave his bedroom; he gave up; he didn’t graduate; he dropped out.”Roy was among dozens of individuals who came to the State House on Tuesday to testify against House Bill 481, the legalization bill that has passed the House twice and is now before the Senate.Opponents like Roy far outnumbered supporters, who were better represented in two House hearings held in Representatives Hall earlier in the year.Opponents pulled out all the stops on Tuesday with a news conference before the committee hearing that featured national figures in the fight against legalization, including Bishop Jethro C. James Jr., pastor at the Paradise Baptist Church in Newark, N.J., who recently helped pressure New Jersey lawmakers to cancel their vote on marijuana legalization.Also in New Hampshire for the hearing was Luke Niforatos, chief of staff for the national group, Smart Approaches to Marijuana, who traveled from Colorado for the event.A lot of witnessesEven legalization advocate Matt Simon, New England political director for the Marijuana Policy Project, had to tip his hat to opponents, led by Sen. Bob Giuda, R-Warren.“They’ve brought a lot of witnesses, including from other states. They’ve done a great job,” he said. “But here are some poll numbers to remind you that the perception we have in this room is not the perception of what the majority of people in New Hampshire actually think about this issue.”Simon alluded to several polls over the years by the UNH Survey Center that have shown growing support for legalization, the most recent in March that showed 68 percent of poll respondents either strongly support (50 percent) or somewhat support (18 percent) legalization, with only 27 percent opposed outright.“We’re not a state where this could be put on the ballot for people to vote on, but if we could, we know it would pass,” said Simon. “I’m not suggesting we should make laws on the basis of a poll, but we do have a constitutional form of government and laws are supposed to be based on the consent of the governed, and in this case, they plainly aren’t.”State Rep. Renny Cushing, D-Hampton, sponsor of the bill, testified in support, as did the chief lobbyist for the NH-ACLU. A handful of “civilians” offered their support for the bill as well, but their testimony stood in contrast to the long line of opponents.Roy was applauded for her stark portrayal of “a new epidemic among my peers.”Clouds of smokeGiuda, just back from a visit to Denver, described “a mall that used to be a center of commerce and now resembles a Third World country with people panhandling and laying around in a cloud of marijuana smoke.”Niforatos described navigating the sidewalks of Denver through a cannabis fog with his wife and 2-year-old daughter.“Every time we go walking down the streets in Denver, every time we do that our daughter and her stroller are just covered with a cloud of second-hand marijuana smoke,” he said. “There’s smoke engulfing her stroller. Our daughter is breathing this smoke into her lungs and there’s nothing we can do about it.”Dan Goodman, the public relations manager for AAA Northern New England said the automobile association opposes the bill largely because there is no widely accepted test for marijuana impairment among drivers.Other opponents testifying included medical and public health professionals, representatives of the N.H. Chiefs of Police and State Police, and the chairman of the legislative committee that spent a year studying the idea.A bipartisan issueThe bill passed the House, 209-147, on Feb. 27 after review by the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee, and again on April 4, 200-163, after review by the Ways and Means Committee, which changed the taxation scheme.Gov. Chris Sununu has promised a veto, and it looks likely to be upheld. Legalizing marijuana was part of the N.H. Democratic Party platform going into the 2018 elections, but neither party is united on the issue.About 50 Republicans voted with Democrats in the House to legalize in February and April, and about 50 Democrats voted against it both times.The outcome of the vote in the Senate is uncertain, but that vote is expected to cross party lines as well.dsolomon@unionleader.com"

The lawsuit seeks to increase the state’s adequacy grants from the current $3,636 per pupil per year, to about $10,000.ConVal filed the lawsuit against the state last month, naming Gov. Chris Sununu, Department of Education Commissioner Frank Edelblut and the Department of Education as defendants in the case. The lawsuit maintains that the state has failed to pay for an adequate education, as required by the New Hampshire Supreme Court in its rulings in the so-called Claremont lawsuits of the 1980s and 1990s.The ConVal lawsuit claims the state ignores its own data when it calculates the annual adequacy grants, resulting in significant under-funding for the districts.“We also believe that adequate levels of school funding should not be determined through an arbitrary process of ‘pick and choose’ dependent upon the subjective judgment of others,” Russell said. “Adequate levels of school funding should be based upon the data compiled annually by the Department of Education on the actual costs districts incur in providing services to our students.”The case is currently pending a ruling from Judge David Ruoff in the Cheshire Superior Court following a hearing on the merits.Ruoff declined to grant an immediate injunction for the districts, which would have immediately meant millions of dollars in funding. He is expected to issue a ruling in the coming weeks, and has already expressed skepticism over the state’s funding formula.“It does not appear, based on the (New Hampshire Department of Education) data, that there is a single school district in the State that could function if it only spent $3,636 on each student,” Ruoff wrote."
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,Andrew Cline: Do Granite Staters really want mandatory paid leave?,"Apr 23, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/opinion/columnists/andrew-cline-do-granite-staters-really-want-mandatory-paid-leave/article_4043671b-c157-50b6-be34-2096d0ef8329.html,"HOUSE DEMOCRATS insisted on incorporating a mandatory paid leave program — and its $168 million wage tax — into the state budget, knowing that this could trigger a veto by Gov. Chris Sununu. It’s a strange hill upon which to die, considering that there’s no evidence Granite Staters are demanding this specific workplace perk.This month the UNH Carsey Center for Public Policy released a report asserting that Granite Staters support guaranteed job protection for paid family and medical leave programs and a 60 percent wage rate while on leave.This is about as useful to lawmakers as a ping pong table is to the Game of Thrones’ Night’s Watch. It’s nice to have, but when the real work starts its minimal utility quickly becomes apparent.Nowhere did the survey ask whether respondents would prefer paid leave to other benefits such as flexible schedules, more health coverage or higher pay. Nowhere did it ask whether employees would prefer paid leave if it led to lower pay raises or reduced benefits in the future. Nowhere did it ask how much employees would be willing to pay for such a benefit.The 2016 UNH poll that purported to show broad support for paid family leave in New Hampshire also left out crucial questions. It did not give respondents the option of choosing from a list of other possible workplace benefits. The only cost it included was $5 per week, which is on the low end of the cost scale for various paid leave programs.Other polls have asked such questions, and their results do not support the theory that paid leave is so critically important for employees that the state must guarantee it via a mandate and wage tax.A 2017 Pew poll found paid leave statistically tied with more flexible work schedules as the most preferred new benefit, with 28 percent preferring schedule flexibility and 27 percent preferring paid leave. (That poll also found, by the way, that most Americans were satisfied with their workplace benefits and thought their employers cared about them and their well-being.)A 2017 study by data research firm FRACTL found that employees ranked paid parental leave 8th among a list of 17 benefit options. More popular were better health benefits, more flexible hours, more vacation time, work from home options, unlimited vacation, student loan assistance and tuition assistance.A 2017 survey by payroll and benefits firm JustWorks found that flexible schedules and remote work options were far more popular among employees than unlimited paid time off or parental leave. Fewer than half of employees said unlimited paid time off or paid parental leave were important.A Cato Institute poll last December found that support for paid leave crashes when people are given the option of considering the costs. In the abstract, 74 percent of Americans support paid leave. But 60 percent oppose paid leave if it would lead to lower future pay raises.Paid leave is being pushed on Granite Staters as if it is universally acknowledged as the holy grail of workplace benefits. It isn’t. National polling shows that most employees prefer other benefits to paid leave. And even if it were the most popular benefit, that wouldn’t make it the right benefit for every employee or every employer.When employers are forced to offer this particular benefit over all others, employees are then forced to accept this particular benefit instead of others employers might have chosen. There is no compelling case for forcing this choice on all New Hampshire employees. Creating a budget showdown over an entirely unwarranted mandatory benefit would only compound the mistake."

Department of Health and Human Services social worker Anna Carrigan of Manchester has accumulated file drawers full of material on the Division for Children, Youth and Families as she works to build her new nonprofit to protect abused children.


DAVID LANE/UNION LEADER FILE



MANCHESTER — When Anna Carrigan of Manchester became convinced that a 3-year-old relative was being sexually abused in 2017, she thought the path forward was pretty clear.“When this all started, we thought that surely we will bring this to the attention of the authorities and they will see everything that is wrong with this picture and will address it, and then my relative would be made safe, life would carry on,” she said.But that’s not what happened.In the ensuing two years, she and members of her immediate family became enmeshed in the state’s child protection system, known for classifying a disproportionately high number of cases as “unfounded.”Carrigan claims their concerns and evidence were arbitrarily dismissed by the Manchester police detective assigned to the case, the case workers at DCYF who relied too heavily on the investigator’s conclusions and a mayor who took no interest in challenging any of those decisions.At that point, most people would have run out of options, but Carrigan is not like most people. She has a master’s degree in social work from UNH and was previously licensed as a child and family therapist.In her current role at the N.H. Department of Health and Human Services, she is an administrator for the state’s asthma control program and will soon assume new responsibilities managing communications for all chronic diseases.She was recognized in the March 28 edition of the DHHS internal employee newsletter in honor of Social Work Month: “A background in social work has proven invaluable in the Division of Public Health Services’ Asthma Control Program, as Program Administrator Anna Carrigan can attest.”Community organizerIn addition to public health, one of her specialties is community organizing and she says she’s now putting that expertise to work in the interest of her family and others who’ve been caught up in what she called “the dumpster fire that is DCYF.”“Unfortunately, public shaming seems to be ultimately what motivates the majority of these people, so if that’s what it takes, then so be it,” she said.She recently launched a nonprofit, the New Road Project, with help from Manchester state Rep. Pat Long, a former alderman now serving as an at-large member on the school board. He has tried to intervene on her behalf in the child abuse case, but says he has also been stonewalled.“We need a new road for child protection in New Hampshire, and we need you to walk it with us,” is the group’s mission.The first major event will be a March for Children and Families, scheduled for July 27 (Aug. 3 rain date), in downtown Concord. A website (thenewroadproject.org) gives more details.“We are also planning a silent vigil of 10 to 15 minutes honoring children who have suffered as part of this system, so families can submit names and photos, whether the children have passed away, got lost in the system or suffered abuse and neglect after being part of the system,” Carrigan said.Intense scrutinyThat system has been under intense scrutiny since the death of 3-year-old Brielle Gage of Nashua in 2014 and 21-month-old Sadie Willott of Manchester in 2015. Both died while their neglect and abuse cases were under DCYF review.Both families are now represented by Bedford attorney Rus Rilee, who last year won a $6.75 million settlement with the state in a lawsuit brought by the grandparents of two young girls who suffered sexual abuse at the hands of their parents while under DCYF supervision.A Concord Monitor investigation in 2017 revealed that at least eight children in the child protective system died since 2011, when major cuts to agency funding took effect in the wake of the Great Recession. Multiple internal and external reviews have been conducted and new management has been brought in, but the agency continues to struggle to keep up with increasing reports of abuse and neglect fueled in large part by the opioid addiction crisis.Despite new positions and increased appropriations in the 2018-19 budget, metrics are moving in the wrong direction, according to the most recent “DCYF workforce capacity and workload analysis.”From September 2018 to February 2019, open assessments increased from 3,329 to 4,126; the vacancy rate in child protective worker positions went from 14 percent to 19 percent; and the average number of open assessments per case worker (which should be 12 to 15 according to national standards) rose from 34 to 45.The Democratically controlled legislature is at odds with the governor over how many more positions to fund, as a House committee voted last Tuesday to fund 77 new positions, while Gov. Chris Sununu would authorize 62 but fund only 26.“Not wanting dead children and refusing to fully fund the child protection system are diametrically opposed ideas,” says Carrigan. “They are mutually exclusive.”She believes the situation deserves at least as much attention as the opioid epidemic, widely recognized as a public health emergency.Her website contains a 12-point policy proposal that includes encouraging Sununu and lawmakers to declare a state of emergency in child protection and request additional federal funding.She is also pushing for higher credentialing standards for child protective service workers, who for the most part are not licensed social workers.“Case workers get much of the blame when things go wrong, but that’s misplaced. It should be redirected up the chain of command,” she said.“Based on the current state of child protection, DCYF case workers are given an impossible task where it is a lose-lose for them and for those they are trying to help.”“They arguably have the most difficult job in the entire government but are some of the lowest paid workers, which is a true testament to how much we actually value the work they do,” she said.Carrigan has assumed personal and professional risk in taking on this battle, and is doing so entirely on her own, without the approval or involvement of her supervisors at DHHS, the parent agency of DCYF.""My views are those of a private citizen, and not those in my role as a state employee,"" she said.She can’t have a direct impact on DCYF funding, training, policy or supervisory decisions, but she can create a rallying point for those who are being directly affected and feel they have no place to turn.“There has been no community grieving or community healing,” she says. “I feel that people are very alone in dealing with this, when in reality there are lots and lots of families who’ve been affected and there hasn’t been an opportunity for us to be angry and sad as a community and move toward restoration.”dsolomon@unionleader.com"

That would end coverage for people with pre-existing conditions. The end of Medicaid expansion. Millions of adult children would be kicked off their parents health insurance. And it would create an impossible choice between bankruptcy or denying my daughter the treatment she needs to live a normal life.











Our best hope are the 21 states defending the ACA from the Trump administration’s efforts to overturn it. Encouragingly, there are both Republican and Democratic governors leading the defense. Unfortunately, Gov. Chris Sununu isn’t one of them. Sununu is standing with the President instead of Granite Staters worried about our health care. He has the opportunity to lead by joining the lawsuit, but he has chosen not to. He has said it’s too late, even when Republican attorneys general in Montana and Ohio spoke out just a few weeks ago.While senators and representatives from both parties in Congress are fighting to save the ACA in Washington, the governor is passing the buck.Gov. Sununu needs to understand the stakes of his decision not to defend the ACA. So, governor, here’s my story. He should know what his decision to stand with the President on health care means to people like me.Two days after the birth of my daughter, she was diagnosed with Tuberous Sclerosis. Essentially, she had benign tumors in every organ in her body, including her brain and her heart. Then, after 48 hours of life, her seizures started. Fortunately, my husband was serving in the military, and our Tricare covered everything — from her medications to her brain surgery. We were able to keep her healthy.After my husband got out of the military, health care became a big problem. You see, my daughter has a complex form of epilepsy. Despite the fact that her doctors had been providing her with effective treatment, our new insurance said it was too expensive and started suggesting alternatives. Can you imagine that? Our insurance, not doctors, said they wanted to stop her treatment because of the cost.And it only got worse. By the time she was a year old, the entire left side of her body was paralyzed. The insurance company said they would cover some physical therapy, but they would cap it at 30 appointments. For her lifetime. After that, it would be on us to foot the bill entirely.Who on earth could afford to pay for that out of pocket, for the rest of her life? My husband and I are both physicians, and we certainly could not. Essentially, they were saying, “Sorry, but your daughter will likely have to stay paralyzed, and never be able to have a job to support herself.”Today, my daughter is 4, and she is doing great. We moved and found insurance that will cover her care. But her health-care expenses far exceed the lifetime caps that insurance companies used to institute before the ACA.It’s a perilous time for families like mine. If the Trump administration is successful in striking down the ACA entirely, then our insurance could just refuse to cover her, because of the treatment she has already received. What kind of person could look a 4 year-old in the eye and tell her that she doesn’t deserve health care?They would be sending a message that she has exceeded her worth in this world. “Whatever you have to contribute to this society is not worth the cost.”We pay the maximum out-of-pocket premiums every year to keep her healthy, but if they strike down the ACA, there’s no way we will be able to afford it. We would quickly end up in medical bankruptcy. It will affect every aspect of the rest of our lives.I know my story is more dramatic than most. But my husband and I are both health-care providers and every day we see what other families are experiencing. People with diabetes are already being priced out of their insulin and test strips. Without the ACA, that pre-existing condition could be enough for any insurance company to deny them care.We can’t afford to go back to a time when health care was reserved exclusively for Americans of means. We need New Hampshire to join the other 21 states fighting to save our care.The governor and state legislature need to hear our stories.They need to stand up for us against Donald Trump because the stakes are too high not to."

Back in February, Cryans joined fellow Democrats Andru Volinsky and Debora Pignatelli in voting to put the raises on hold, citing concerns over the commission’s failure to meet its budgeted revenue targets, implement mail-order sales and install new inventory and sales management software that has been promised for years.Volinsky also cited strained relations with the state employees who staff the 79 liquor and wine outlets.After the vote, Cryans said he’s learned that NHLC Chairman Joseph W. Mollica has begun meeting with Rich Gulla, president of the state employees’ union, which prompted him to support the raises.“I thought it was important to get the two of them together, so I contacted both of them and asked if they would be willing to get together and talk on a monthly basis,” he said. “They had their first meeting and promised me they are going to meet monthly.”Gulla confirmed that the meetings are taking place. “We’ve been meeting with the Liquor Commission in an effort to work together to resolve issues,” he said. “Much remains to be done and we are hopeful to see meaningful progress in our relationship.”Cryans was joined by Republicans Ted Gatsas and Russell Prescott, who never supported withholding the raises in the first place.The raises will see Mollica’s pay go from $118,707 to $124,579; Director of Enforcement and Licensing Mark C. Armaganian’s from $103,059 to $108,149; Deputy Commissioner Michael R. Milligan’s from $112,255 to $117,805; and Director of Marketing, Merchandising and Warehousing Nicole Brassard-Jordan’s from $103,059 to $108,149.There was no indication on the council agenda for the April 17 meeting that the raises were going to come up for a second vote. The governor controls what comes before the council, and he accepted the late item submitted by email on April 16.Pressure on SoucyDeath penalty repeal advocates are confident they have the votes to overturn an expected veto of the repeal bill by Gov. Chris Sununu, but aren’t taking anything for granted.John-Michael Dumais, campaign director for the Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty, says members of law enforcement and others who want to keep capital punishment on the books aren’t going quietly into the night.“We have continued to hear that some senators have been coming under fire for their vote on the death penalty. We believe this is a coordinated attack, not just a few random constituents,” wrote Dumais in an email urging repeal opponents reach out to their senators as well.“In particular, Senate President Donna Soucy has been under constant pressure from police groups and other constituents, not just this year but for several years running,” according to Dumais. “It’s no overstatement to say that support in the Senate would not be as strong without her leadership.”Soucy is one of three senators representing Manchester, where police officer Michael Briggs was murdered in 2006 by Michael Addison, New Hampshire’s only convict on death row.Opponents of repeal have warned that Addison will never be executed if capital punishment is banned in New Hampshire, even though repeal advocates claim the repeal won’t be applied retroactively.Manchester Sen. Kevin Cavanaugh voted against repeal. The dean of the Senate, Manchester’s Lou D’Allesandro, has voted against repeal in the past, although he was absent for the vote on April 11.Soucy has stood alone as a Manchester senator favoring repeal.The Senate president says her recent vote for repeal should not have surprised anyone, as she has been consistent on the issue throughout her career. Nor was there any pressure on senators from party leadership to vote one way or the other.“This has really been an issue of conscience,” she said. “And one that does not break along party lines.”dsolomon@unionleader.com"

Overdose deaths have pared the population of recidivist inmates, those with lengthy rap sheets for petty crimes who are in and out of county jails, said Rick Van Wickler, the superintendent at the Cheshire County jail.Other factors are programs such as drug court, mental health court and county-launched diversion programs that offer treatment-focused alternatives to incarceration.“Finally, in the corrections environment we’re getting the chance to practice corrections,” said Stephen Church, the superintendent of the Rockingham County jail, who has been in county corrections for 30 years. “Just putting people in cells and letting them out doesn’t work.”Four years ago, his average inmate count was 247. When he spoke to a reporter last week, he was housing 147.The number of inmates in the state’s largest jail, Valley Street jail in Manchester, was 260 on April 1. In September 2015, the population was 502, and last September it was 395.The drop prompted Corrections Superintendent David Dionne to request a slight budget reduction when he appeared before county commissioners earlier this month. He cited numerous reasons: bail reform, drug court, mental health court and his jail’s own drug treatment program.Not all have experienced such a reduction.In Belknap County, the annual average daily population count has stayed in the mid 80s to low 90s over the last four to five years, said jail Superintendent Keith Gray.“Every county has different judges, different interpretations of the bail reform law,” he said.And the state prison system has experienced a much lower reduction than counties — a 6 percent drop over the last five years, to 2,550 inmates. Spokesman Laura Montenegro attributed the drop to reductions in new crime admissions and probation violations.The jail in Strafford County has a stable population, too. But that’s because the county instituted a Community Corrections program more than a decade ago and saw reductions then, said County Administrator Ray Bower.Such efforts capture the spirit of the bail reform law adopted last year.Community Corrections staff meet with a defendant prior to a bail hearing and work up a plan. It involves family support, employment, drug or mental health treatment and restrictions on when a defendant can be outside his home and where he can go, Bower said.The staff also monitors them. Staff will call a defendant to remind him or her of a court date. They will visit at work. And some inmates will be on electronic ankle bracelets that monitor locations and issue warnings if a defendant enters a victim’s neighborhood.The Strafford County jail, built to hold 495 inmates, had 101 county inmates as of last week. Another 305 federal prisoners, many Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainees, were incarcerated there, which generates millions for the county over a year’s time.“This isn’t something everyone falls in line with and says we should do this,” Bower said. “We had to crawl before we could walk. Now we’re jogging.”An essential component of the state’s criminal justice system, county jails operate independently. The state Department of Corrections operates state prisons, halfway houses and state parole and probation programs.Jails house inmates awaiting trial — for everything from drunken driving to murder. And they house people sentenced to jail for a year or less, generally those guilty of misdemeanor crimes.A county’s jail, also termed a house of correction, is funded and overseen by county government. When reforms happen, it involves collaboration by the jail, county prosecutors, judges, the sheriff and county commissioners, officials said.

“You’ve got to get the whole criminal justice wheel in your county involved,” Church said.He said bail reform did not have as big an impact on his population as Felonies First, a court reform that went into effect in late 2017.Under Felonies First, a person arrested on a felony charge is promptly arraigned in superior court, where felony crimes are adjudicated. Previously, an inmate was arraigned in district courts, which handle misdemeanors and traffic violations.The lower-court judges would set a high bail, and defendants would enter what Church called “the black hole of criminal justice,” often waiting months before the case moved to superior court.Both Dionne, at Hillsborough County, and Van Wickler, at Cheshire County, said overdose deaths also contribute to the reduction.Van Wickler said one of his sergeants started tracking the deaths of recidivists, culling names from obituaries and other sources. An average of 27 died in each of the last two years.“All these people, they come in, they come out, and suddenly you don’t see them anymore,” Van Wickler said. His census last week was 115, down about 10 or 15 from what it would have been the previous year, he said.He said Felonies First and bail reform are factors.“All these things are coming together from the late ’90s and 2000s, what reformists had been yelling about,” he said.For those in jail, the environment is changing.Felicia Gray said inmates get along better when there are fewer in a tier. “There doesn’t seem to be as many bullies,” Gray said. Accused of providing drugs to someone who died, she was denied bail.In the tier with her last week was Tiffanie Portinari. A sentenced inmate, Portinari was participating the the jail’s in-house drug treatment program. She and fellow enrollees are in class and counseling for six hours a day. Once that is complete, they will be sent home early, and the jail will check up on them.Of the 151 enrolled in the program, only 16 have failed, according to statistics he shared.The latest criminal justice reform piece — bail reform — is creating some pushback. Gov. Chris Sununu signed it into law last year despite the opposition from county prosecutors.Patricia Conway, the Rockingham County Attorney, said judicial warrants — which a judge issues when a defendant doesn’t show up to court — are way up. That means more work for sheriff deputies, who have to chase down the defendant, and more work for court clerks and prosecutors.Likewise, Hillsborough County’s Dionne said police are more busy because people who would be in jail are now on the street.“My recidivism has gone down, their (police) work has gone up,” he said.But he remains a strong supporter of setting bail based on the ability of a person to pay.Before bail reform, the county had to feed and provide medical care for someone who can’t afford a $50 bail. If the inmate killed himself, his staff would take it hard. And even a brief incarceration would prompt a suspension of an inmate’s Social Security disability benefits, further complicating the chances of success outside the jail, Dionne said.Prosecutors are working with lawmakers to pare back the reform. Changes could amount to allowing a judge to take a person’s drug abuse into account. Another change would allow a high bail for people with a history of skipping court dates.“We just want to make sure folks dangerous can be held, and risk of flight held as well,” Conway said.Rockingham County Attorney Patricia Conway applauded the larger aspects of criminal justice reform such as diversion programs. As jails become more experienced with corrections and diversion — Rockingham County is preparing to provide suboxone and methadone to inmates — the jails may end up filling up with people participating in true rehabilitation programs.Although criminal justice reform has been around for years, it came into focus in New Hampshire when county officials faced the potential of spending millions to build more jails.“It forced people to really look at the problem; who are we putting in jail?” she said.Church, who started in corrections working a cellblock, said he’s a die-hard Republican conservative who favors law and order. But over a three-decade career, he’s seen what works and doesn’t work.A lot of that time, he said, the system was just spinning its wheels.“I’ve seen how we treat the issue, and people come around,” Church said. “The one thing that haunts me is not doing that 15, 20 years ago.”mhayward@unionleader.com"
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,Negotiations with state employees move to fact-finding as mediation fails,"Apr 18, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/politics/state/negotiations-with-state-employees-move-to-fact-finding-as-mediation/article_f8fdd263-9f77-504a-8b0e-e9a4c6aeb153.html,"CONCORD — A mediator has been unsuccessful in helping state employees reach a compromise with Gov. Chris Sununu on a new contract, so the process now moves to fact-finding.Leaders of state employees’ unions declared an impasse on Feb. 19 in their ongoing 2020 and 2021 contract negotiations with the state, resulting in the appointment of a mediator.After the first mediation session, the unions notified the state that they want to move to fact-finding.Fact-finding is a more formal process in which each party presents data and documentation to support its case. A fact-finding panel then deliberates and issues a fact-finding report with non-binding recommendations.Sununu accused the unions of playing politics.“Although state employees have received two raises in the past 12 months, union leaders are refusing to negotiate and have walked away from the table on day one of mediation,” he said. “It is unfortunate that state employees have been caught in the middle of these union politics.”Sununu said the state has proposed a number of enhanced benefits and additional wage increases, but his office declined to provide any details.Jim Nall, co-chair of the State Employees’ Association bargaining team, said wages, overtime pay and prescription drug benefits are among the key issues.“Gov. Sununu is seeking another concessionary contract, when the state workforce continues to suffer from concessions made during the recession,” said Nall.“The economy is booming, yet the state wants us to accept a small, deferred wage increase, along with changes to overtime and prescription benefits that would do real harm to the people who keep this state running. It would be a massive disservice to them to accept what the governor is proposing.”The deal currently in place was reached in April of 2018. Under that agreement, workers represented by the State Employees Association, the New England Police Benevolent Association and the New Hampshire Troopers Association got 1.5 percent raises in 2018 and another 1.5 percent in 2019.Corrections workers, represented by the Teamsters, got a 9.1 percent raise in the hope of easing recruiting and retention problems because of higher pay in other states.dsolomon@unionleader.com"
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,Senate unanimous in passing new protections for public sector workers,"Apr 18, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/politics/state/senate-unanimous-in-passing-new-protections-for-public-sector-workers/article_e16003ca-9aec-5ebf-bcd0-c0e11c98ecf8.html,"CONCORD — Samantha Wooten and her mother Allison were beaming from the balcony of the state Senate chamber on Thursday, as all 24 senators turned in their direction and applauded Samantha’s three-year effort to improve protections for public-sector employees in New Hampshire.The applause came after unanimous passage of a bill that expands the authority of the state Department of Labor to investigate workplace accidents that kill or seriously injure state, county or municipal employees, who don’t enjoy the OSHA protections that exist in the private sector.The legislation also empowers the commissioner to require certain precautions or changes in procedures to avoid future accidents.Wooten tried unsuccessfully with the help of former Manchester Rep. Mark MacKenzie to have similar legislation passed in 2017, after a 2016 industrial accident killed her father, Tom Wooten, while he was working for the Northfield Highway Department.The outcome was different this time around, as the bill (HB 406) passed the House on a voice vote in March. It was near the top of the Senate agenda for Thursday, but some senators were busy testifying at House hearings, so it was delayed until all 24 could be present and recorded as voting “yes” in a roll-call.“This legislation is vital and we should all support it,” said Sen. Jeb Bradley, R-Wolfeboro.The next step for Wooten and her supporters in the legislature and the National Council on Occupational Safety and Health is to push for a state partnership with OSHA now in place in 28 states. The federal government would split the cost of OSHA-level oversight, investigations and enforcement for public employee safety with the state.That bill, because of the costs involved, would be a heavier lift, but state Sen. Kevin Cavanaugh, D-Manchester, said he’s on board.“I’d be honored to sponsor something like that,” said Cavanaugh, chair of the Senate Commerce Committee and assistant business manager for the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers in New Hampshire, as he met with Samantha and her mother after the vote.“We always talk about worker safety, but this is personal. Safety is who you are going home to tonight, and that’s what we all want. It’s something every worker in the state deserves,” he said.For now, the Wootens are relishing the moment, even though it’s bittersweet. Allison said she was shocked to discover there was no provision for an investigation into her husband’s death.“I’m so proud of her, beyond proud,” she said as she hugged her daughter in the State House hallway, fighting back tears.Samantha is ready to push for a New Hampshire OSHA plan, but not right away.“That would be the long-term goal,” she said. “I don’t know yet. But for now, I’m going on vacation.”She hopes to be back in time to see Gov. Chris Sununu sign the bill into law.dsolomon@unionleader.com"

BOB QUINN


Bob Quinn of Seabrook, currently serving as assistant commissioner, was confirmed to replace John Barthelmes as commissioner.Barthelmes is retiring after nearly 12 years at the helm of the state agency responsible for state police and a variety of other public safety services.













PERRY PLUMMER


Perry Plummer of Dover, currently serving as Director of Homeland Security and Emergency Management, was confirmed as the next assistant commissioner.Both votes were unanimous on the five-member council, which acted on nominations from Gov. Chris Sununu.Quinn has been assistant commissioner of the Department of Safety since 2016. He was appointed director of the New Hampshire State Police in 2010, with the rank of colonel, and oversaw enforcement of criminal, motor vehicle, and other public safety laws, and the regulation of detective agencies and security services.Plummer was appointed Director of the Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management in 2013 by then-Gov. Maggie Hassan. He previously served as Director of Fire Standards and Training and Emergency Medical Services, overseeing the Fire Academy, fire training curriculum and certification, and the Bureau of Emergency Medical Services.“I will work tirelessly alongside the great men and women in the department and our partners in public safety to continue to improve the security and physical safety of the citizens of New Hampshire,” said Quinn.Plummer said he would bring his homeland security and fire service perspectives to the Department of Safety Commissioner’s Office."

Seth Moulton, D-Mass., will become the 19th candidate to seek the Democratic nomination and the second major candidate from the Bay State, joining U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., according to multiple sources.The 40-year-old Iraq War veteran will surely focus more on national security and services to veterans than many of those already in the race.Moulton formed a Super PAC in 2018 that led to a surging number of Democratic candidates running for major office, including Maura Sullivan of Portsmouth. She finished runner-up to Chris Pappas in the 1st Congressional District primary.Moulton made a pair of appearances on Sullivan’s behalf during that campaign.Axios first reported Wednesday that Moulton was seen filming his campaign advertisement in Marblehead, Mass.The decision is expected to drop on Monday.Then on Wednesday he arrives as the latest speaker in the Politics & Eggs Forum at the Bedford Village Inn. This event begins at 7:30 a.m.A Marine veteran, he served four tours in Iraq.For months Moulton has been weighing the bid, often meeting with veterans and Democratic activists in early states, including this one.Booker’s campaign boss takes NH pulseAddisu Demissie, campaign manager for Democrat Cory Booker’s presidential campaign, spent two days in New Hampshire earlier this week after his candidate had a campaign kickoff in Booker’s Newark, N.J., hometown.Demissie had managed Gavin Newsom’s successful campaign for governor in 2018 and managed Booker’s first campaign for the Senate in 2013.Even as many states crowd New Hampshire’s first-in-the-nation primary date, Demissie said Booker will invest a lot of time and resources to winning here.“I think the voters of the early states deserve the respect of candidates coming to their communities and asking for their votes,” Demissie said.“This is the role New Hampshire has played for generations in the process and Cory does want to campaign in that tradition. The same is true in Iowa.”Booker has been here three times since officially entering the race and he’ll be here again May 12, when he’s one of four Southern New Hampshire University commencement speakers.He also picked up a second State Senate endorsement, with Sen. David Watters of Dover announcing his support.Lights, camera, action for NH Senate RepublicansOK it wasn’t exactly a Hollywood production, but the Facebook ad the New Hampshire Senate Republicans put together earlier this week signaled the GOP is getting into the game early.When it comes to digital messaging, most partisan Republicans would probably admit New Hampshire Democrats have enjoyed an advantage.That’s what makes this ad notable. And for this far away from the election, the rhetoric is pretty strong.Sen. Robert Guida, R-Warren: “The capital gains tax that is proposed by the Democrats is going to hurt seniors the most.”Sen. David Starr, R-Franconia: “Democrats are waging a war on Live Free or Die.”Sen. Regina Birdsell, R-Hampstead: “Democrats are not trying to get away with voter fraud. They are actually trying to legalize it.”Sen. James Gray, R-Rochester: “I don’t think I have enough fingers and toes to count the number of taxes the Democrats have tried to pass.”Sen. Sharon Carson, R-Londonderry: “So join me in voting for Republicans so we can continue to make New Hampshire the best place ever.”Sen. Chuck Morse, R-Salem: “More taxes, more fees; that’s the Democrats’ agenda.”Those are some of the sound bites and to be sure they take some liberty with the facts. The proposed capital gains tax has a hefty exemption, which means the most wealthy will generate most of the estimated $85 million a year.Senate Majority Leader Dan Feltes, a possible Democratic candidate for governor in 2020, was pretty strong himself in a fundraising pitch earlier this week.“Sununu has stood in the way for long enough. We’ve done all we can in the Senate, now we need your help to get it through the Governor’s office,” Feltes said. “Chip in and help us get Sununu out of the way.”DCYF staffing gets green lightGov. Chris Sununu could have difficulty winning one policy fight with the Legislature.That is over staffing of the Division of Children, Youth and Families.Both sides agree the agency needs more people to reduce heavy workloads that caseworkers are facing.The Senate has approved and a House panel endorsed a bill to hire an additional 20 supervisors and 57 caseworkers.In his budget, Sununu only paid for a fraction of that additional staff.He has said he wants administrators at the Department of Health and Human Services to use management flexibility to seek even more personnel over the next two years.Hiring on more staff hasn’t been easy. The department hasn’t filled all of the jobs that they were given from the current budget for 2018 and 2019.There are clearly many House and Senate Republicans who are on board with giving DCYF much if not all that the Democrats have proposed.“New Hampshire children can’t wait any longer for the state to fulfill our responsibility to protect their safety and well being,” said Sen. Jon Morgan, D-Brentwood, the Senate bill’s prime sponsor. “We must act now to protect our most vulnerable citizens — by increasing staffing levels and reducing caseloads, that’s just what SB 6 will do.”(For more Granite Status, go to www.unionleader.com.)Connolly fondly rememberedThe sudden death of former Securities Regulation Director Mark Connolly of New Castle last week hit hard for many in the political game.A 2016 Democratic candidate for governor, Connolly, 63, had many close friends across the political spectrum.Sean Downey had worked as a consultant on Connolly’s 2016 bid.“One thing stands out to me among them all; that he is among the kindest people I’ve known and with an intelligence, curiosity and dogged commitment to making his community better that very few possess. New Hampshire was better for his service and participation in the process and I was fortunate to work with him and call him a friend. I’m going to miss him and our (often lengthy, but always informative) chats and his unmistakable sense of humor. He was one of the very good guys,” Downey posted on social media.Samantha Piatt, chief of staff to former Manchester mayor Ted Gatsas, said humanity can remain amidst the rough and tumble.“I am so sorry, but how lucky are we to know and experience loyalty in a business where I find myself questioning daily if that even exists anymore, and feeling blessed that I did, and still do, and you did as well,” Piatt wrote in response.Harris brings campaign back to NHYou can get your monthly dose of presidential politics next Monday night when five Democratic hopefuls each go back-to-back-to-back-to-back with hour-long town halls at Saint Anselm College, to be broadcast on CNN.As you can see from the Candidate Calendar, Minnesota Sen.

The state Executive Committee’s choice of Elliot Gault signals Sununu’s desire to take more control of the party apparatus than he had during his first term as governor.Gault has been Sununu’s director of appointments and liaison to the Executive Council.He takes over the party post early next month.Cheewing got a lot of praise from activists for helping man a GOP staff that was outgunned by the much larger staff and campaign budget Democrats had going into the midterms.”When I started as a county chair in 2013, Todd was there to help me on my way, teaching me so much with patience and a cheerful disposition,” said Kate Day, who headed up Cheshire County and ran for vice chairman.”He has continued to give me so much support in my present role, even knowing his tenure was coming to an end.”Shaheen gives foreign policy speech after Mideast tripU.S. Sen.Jeanne Shaheen will speak on foreign policy Thursday at the University of New Hampshire in Durham, starting at 12:40 p.m. in the Memorial Union Building.The UNH Global Education Center and International Affairs Program is sponsoring the event.Shaheen just got back from a weekend trip to Afghanistan with fellow Democratic senators Jack Reed of Rhode Island and Doug Jones of Alabama.Sununu tried to please both camps with picks.As our David Solomon reported, the Executive Council confirmed Bob Quinn of Seabrook as the commissioner of safety to replace retiring Commissioner John Barthlemes of Hopkinton.The council also OK’d Sununu’s pick of Homeland Security and Emergency Management’s Perry Plummer to take the assistant commissioner post that Quinn has held.Both had their supporters in public safety. Many in the police community were rooting for Quinn, who was state police director before he moved into the commissioner’s office.Those in emergency management and fire safety talked up Plummer, given his background.The compromise to promote them both seemed to go over pretty well.klandrigan@unionleader.com"

Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,Gardner urges lawmakers to 'treat all voters equally',"Apr 16, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/politics/state/gardner-urges-lawmakers-to-treat-all-voters-equally/article_ac0f480e-a64a-5fdf-a8d9-6c3d19fde4e8.html,"CONCORD — A Senate-passed bill that would make it easier for out-of-state college students to vote was heard before the House Election Law Committee on Tuesday, as a deeply partisan battle over who gets to cast a ballot continues to rage at the State House.A bill passed by the Republican-led legislature in 2018 and signed into law by Gov. Chris Sununu, HB 1264, discourages students in the state’s college towns from voting, according to critics, by requiring them to obtain a New Hampshire driver’s license and motor vehicle registration within 60 days of casting a ballot.The new law doesn’t take effect until July 1, but it’s already being challenged in court by the ACLU. The lawsuit was filed in February on behalf of two Dartmouth College students who claim the new law violates their constitutional rights and represents a 21st-century “poll tax.”Meanwhile, Democrats who now hold a majority in both House and Senate have filed bills to modify or repeal the new law.In the House, Democrats passed a bill to repeal HB 1264 outright, while the Senate passed a bill that would create a carve-out from the motor vehicle requirements for students and other transient residents who claim New Hampshire as their domicile for purposes of voting.Both bills passed entirely along party lines, without a single Republican vote in either House or Senate.The House held its hearing on the Senate bill (SB 67) on Tuesday, with Secretary of State Bill Gardner appearing as the star witness.Although the Secretary of State’s office was listed as neutral on the bill, it was clear from his testimony that Gardner is comfortable with HB 1264 as it stands.He told House lawmakers it was their prerogative to exempt student voters from the DMV requirements, but he thinks “everyone should be treated equally.”“No matter how rich you are, or smart you are, when you are in that line at the polling place, you are the same as everyone. When you start fracturing that with exceptions, that is the path that leads to where the country was in the 1960s,” said Gardner, alluding to literacy tests and other devices used to exclude voters in the past.If the change has to be made, he said, it should be made in motor vehicle statutes, not in the definition of residency that applies to all state laws.Gilles Bissonnette, ACLU-NH legal director, testified that SB 67 addresses many of the concerns that prompted the lawsuit on behalf of college students “by carving out voters who are domiciled in New Hampshire, but who do not have an indefinite intention to remain in New Hampshire, from HB 1264’s motor vehicle fee obligations so as to not chill their right to vote.”Many states specify that college students and similar voters who live in the state temporarily are not obligated to pay motor vehicle residency fees, even if they vote in the state, according to Bissonnette, who cited laws in Vermont, Arizona, Utah and West Virginia.“Students who live there, but who moved from other states, are explicitly exempted from a requirement to register their vehicles,” he said. “Most states have either no explicit connection between voting and motor vehicle fees, or else treat voter registration as only one non-conclusive factor in determining motor vehicle residency.”Examples of those states include Georgia, Idaho, Oregon and South Carolina. In Maine, there are no criminal penalties if a voter fails to obtain a Maine driver’s license or car registration after they register to vote in Maine, Bissonnette pointed out.The Senate Election Committee is scheduled to hold its hearing on the House bill to repeal HB 1264 on Wednesday .dsolomon@unionleader.com"

Chris Sununu’s letter to state agencies regarding a possible state budget deadlock is a prudent move. The huge gap between his budget and what Democrats want to spend is not going to be easily bridged.The governor’s warning of a budget veto is no idle threat and taxpayers should do all they can to encourage him to stand firm.In the meantime, Sununu was wise to let state government heads know now to make contingency plans to make do with an extension of the current budget. They might also be prepared with facts and figures to counter what will no doubt be sob stories and scare tactics from a legislature that appears prepared to reject Sununu’s own budget increases in favor of much bigger spending.To those department heads who might claim “hardships” under the current budget, Sununu rightly suggested that they have plans ready to re-allocate existing funds.It has been a cool spring so far, but things may get a lot hotter in June.Taxpayers should let legislators know they are prepared to weather a few storms."

Chris Sununu staffer, as its new executive director.Since July 2017, Gault has been director of appointments for Sununu, acting as the staff liaison to the state Executive Council.In 2016, he headed up the grassroots staffing and volunteer field campaign for the reelection of then-Sen. Kelly Ayotte, a Republican, who narrowly lost to Democrat Maggie Hassan.Gault had earlier worked on Ayotte’s Senate staff.Todd Cheewing was executive director for the NH GOP through the 2018 election cycle and agreed to stay on until the new chairman Stephen Stepanek recommended a permanent replacement.“Elliot is going to do a great job; he’s the perfect choice and I think he’ll be terrific at it,” Cheewing said during a telephone interview.“This is my third stint working for the NH GOP. I’ve really enjoyed it.”The NH GOP Executive Committee approved the staff change at a business meeting Monday night.The move also signals a desire by Sununu to take more control over the state party apparatus.After winning his first term in 2016, Sununu promoted former State Sen. Jeanie Forrester of Meredith, who had run against Sununu in that GOP primary, as the next party boss.Last June Forrester abruptly resigned from the party post to become town administrator in Tilton.Vice Chairman Wayne MacDonald of Derry was promoted to the top post, but the party, disorganized and nearly broke, lost badly to Democrats in the midterm elections.klandrigan@unionleader.com"
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,Woman's quest to change NH worker safety laws about to yield results,"Apr 15, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/politics/state/woman-s-quest-to-change-nh-worker-safety-laws-about/article_0cf8115c-d26c-5059-8f9f-8e53f014138c.html,"CONCORD — Samantha Wooten has reluctantly accepted the fact that she’ll never know what caused the work-site accident that killed her father in 2016, but she could soon be comforted by the knowledge that other families may be spared a similar fate.Wooten has been trying for three years to get state labor laws changed to better protect public-sector employees after her father, Tom Wooten of Belmont, was trapped between a tractor and the trailer it was hauling while working for the Northfield Highway Department.In New Hampshire, private-sector employees are subject to the protections and oversight of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration, but state, county and municipal employees are not.Twenty-eight states have adopted an OSHA partnership with a 50-50 funding split that extends OSHA protections to public works employees, but New Hampshire is not one of them.The state Senate on Thursday is scheduled to vote on a House bill that that won’t go so far as to create an OSHA plan for New Hampshire’s public sector employees, but it will require more aggressive action by the state Department of Labor after serious workplace accidents.The bill, HB 406, passed the House in a voice vote on March 14. The Senate Commerce Committee endorsed it, 5-0, on April 11. If the Senate passes the bill on Thursday and it’s signed into law by Gov. Chris Sununu, all of which seems likely at this point, it will mark the end of a three-year journey for Wooten.She appeared before lawmakers for the third time last week, in what has become an emotionally draining exercise for the Department of Justice employee who works as a case manager for juvenile court diversion.“It is still unclear how or why my father was caught between the two machines,” she told senators. “It crushed his pelvis. I would have thought that since this accident resulted in an untimely death, there would be an adequate investigation, but I was proven wrong. There was no investigation besides the police report.”The drivers submitted to blood toxicology tests, but no further investigation was conducted and, as far as Wooten knows, no procedures were changed.“That lack of investigation made me feel my father’s life did not mean as much as someone in the private sector, where OSHA has jurisdiction,” she testified. “I have to live every day without seeing my dad’s bright eyes and handsome smile.”In fatal accidents, the bill requires a state Department of Labor investigation, stating, “The commissioner shall investigate the cause of death and may notify the employer of precautions to be taken that may prevent the recurrence of similar events.”In cases of serious injury, the commissioner of labor will have the option of launching an investigation and providing safety recommendations.The bill defines serious injury as anything that results in an amputation, loss or fracture of any body part, head injury or an internal injury that requires immediate hospitalization.“This bill addresses a very significant issue,” said prime sponsor Rep. Rebecca McBeath, D-Portsmouth. “This will impact all of our citizens, from the high school student operating a weed wacker to our school and highway employees. The goal here is that these serious injuries and accidents can be looked at, investigated, and suggestions made on how to prevent them in the future.”Rudy Ogden, deputy commissioner at the state Department of Labor, said the agency welcomes the opportunity to have reporting requirements and inspection authority written into statute, but is not equipped to provide OSHA-level inspections.“We are not OSHA. We do not have the funding and training that OSHA has,” said Ogden. “So even if this is set up, you are not going to get us doing accident reconstruction or things of that nature.”Susi Nord, an administrator with the National Council on Occupational Safety and Health, has worked closely with Wooten, along with former Democratic state Rep. Mark MacKenzie, a longtime AFL-CIO executive who gave up his seat last year for an unsuccessful Congressional bid.Ultimately, they’d like to see a New Hampshire-based OSHA plan for public employees, but Nord said the provisions of HB 406, if implemented, will be an improvement.“I know they won’t investigate everything,” she said. “That doesn’t happen with OSHA. But the national council would like to see the state of New Hampshire move toward seeing that inspectors who protect our public employees have the training they need.”dsolomon@unionleader.com"
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,Private prison operator among those expressing interest in secure psychiatric hospital,"Apr 15, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/politics/state/private-prison-operator-among-those-expressing-interest-in-secure-psychiatric/article_ebda5f31-29fa-5fbb-9651-063e5159267f.html,"CONCORD — The question of whether New Hampshire needs to commit $26 million immediately to the construction of a new secure forensic psychiatric hospital has become a point of dispute in state budget deliberations.Gov. Chris Sununu included the funding in his budget proposal submitted to the Legislature in February, but House budget writers removed it, saying the project needs more study before funding.While the issue works its way through the budgeting process, one thing has become apparent: There is no shortage of private companies interested in building and operating the facility, and one of them is a contributor to the Sununu campaign who’s hired a lobbyist with links to the Sununu family.The Department of Health and Human Services was already at work on the project long before Sununu announced plans to include the $26 million in his budget. The department posted a request for information from potential bidders last fall and got three responses, all of which were made public earlier this year on the DHHS website.The three responses came from CoreCivic of Nashville, Tenn.; Correct Care Recovery Solutions of Deerfield Beach, Fla.; and NeuroInternational of Sarasota, Fla.While Correct Care and NeuroInternational have origins as providers of residential treatment for behavioral health, CoreCivic is the rebranded version of Corrections Corporations of America (CCA), which operates private prisons.CoreCivic is not proposing to operate the secure forensic psychiatric hospital, but is proposing a real estate-only solution, in which it would own the hospital and lease it to the state. The management and staffing of the facility would be carried out by the government or contracted to another vendor.CoreCivic does not currently own or operate any secure psychiatric hospitals.Class action lawsuitCCA has been named in a number of lawsuits alleging unsafe conditions that led to deaths. On March 28, shareholders suing CoreCivic were granted class action status by a U.S. District Court Judge in Nashville for a lawsuit claiming the company inflated stock prices by misrepresenting the quality and value of its services.The lawsuit claims Corrections Corporation of America “ran unsafe, low quality prisons that caused multiple deaths and did not save money.”""The allegations made in lawsuits are not confirmed as fact until a jury or a court renders a verdict,"" said a company spokesperson in an email.In the last gubernatorial campaign, Sununu’s Democratic opponent, former state Sen. Molly Kelly, called on Sununu to return campaign contributions from for-profit prison companies involved in immigrant detention, including $10,000 from CoreCivic.The Secretary of State register of lobbyists shows that CoreCivic also hired New Hampshire lobbyist Marc Brown. He confirmed on Friday that he represents CoreCivic, but declined to comment further.Brown has a connection to the Sununu family through his association with principals in the Profile Strategy Group, based in Exeter, and co-founded by Sununu’s brother Michael Sununu.The governor’s campaign adviser Jamie Burnett, was a principal with Profile Strategy, and until April of last year the president of Advantage Government Affairs, where his partners included Marc Brown.Decades long struggleNew Hampshire has struggled since the 1980s with the fact that its most challenging mental health patients have been housed at a secure unit in the state prison. The push toward a secure unit associated with the state’s psychiatric hospital has been motivated by a desire to get mental health patients out of the prison setting.Sununu has been a supporter of the effort to build a new SPU and was well aware of the DHHS request for information when it went out last fall.“We’ve always said that’s a key priority for us,” said Sununu at the time. “We have to find out what is best, whether it’s building a whole new unit or transferring those who are in the SPU into a better facility. Whatever it is, the state has to do something. This is one of those issues that has gone on long enough.”The DHHS made clear last fall that its posting of a request for information was not intended to result in a contract or agreement, but was designed only to help the state decide whether it would be more efficient to build and run the facility on its own, or contract with an outside firm.“Before any contract is awarded, it is fully vetted by the Department of Health and Human Services, and voted on by the Executive Council, allowing for full public transparency,” said Sununu’s spokesman Ben Vihstadt.“Michael Sununu is not a registered lobbyist in the state of New Hampshire and has had no contact with Gov. Sununu regarding the SPU, and absolutely no organization or lobbyist that has business before the state of New Hampshire receives preferential treatment.”Political hot potatoThe SPU has become a political hot potato as the House and Senate passed amendments addressing its fate last Thursday.The House did not go so far as to restore the full funding requested by Sununu, but did pass an amendment appropriating $1.2 million for engineering and design studies.At almost the same time, the Senate passed an amendment allocating the full $26 million, but then tabled it for inclusion in budget negotiations with the House and governor.“The fact remains that Gov. Sununu included $26 million in his budget to build a new, secure forensic hospital. The Democrats’ $1.2M plan fails to fund the new, secure forensic hospital that Gov. Sununu proposed, which would have ended the emergency department boarding crisis and ensured that mental health patients have the support they need,” said Vihstadt.“These families have waited over 20 years for a solution to this crisis.”dsolomon@unionleader.com"
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,"Dave Solomon's State House Dome: Brace for budget veto, Sununu says","Apr 15, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/politics/statehouse_dome/dave-solomon-s-state-house-dome-brace-for-budget-veto/article_8bb782c2-8cbf-5422-870c-6354ab0ce34d.html,"Gov. Chris Sununu is telling state officials to prepare for a possible budget veto, which would leave the state with no budget as of June 30.A veto also would set the stage for weeks, if not months, of operating under funding levels authorized in the current budget.In a letter to agency heads delivered on Friday, a copy of which was obtained by the Union Leader, Sununu calls the budget that passed the Democratically controlled House on Thursday one that “replicates the mistakes of the past.”“A budget that does not protect New Hampshire’s best interests will be vetoed,” he writes.“In the event that I must take action to stop an irresponsible budget, I ask that you and your staff begin to make the necessary preparations for the possibility of a continuing resolution on the state budget at current funding levels.”If Sununu vetoes the budget, state agencies won’t run out of money and suspend operations, but most likely will be funded at current levels, assuming the legislature passes and Sununu signs a continuing resolution.Anticipated new spending on mental health services, child protection and a host of other initiatives would be put on hold, but the DMV would continue to operate, roads would be maintained, state offices would remain open.Sununu’s directive could be considered prudent, given the House has passed a budget at odds with the governor’s proposal in several key areas. But it is also no doubt intended as a shot across the bow of the Democratically controlled Senate as it begins its budget-writing process.The governor gets to present his budget first, which Sununu did in February. The House takes that document and creates its own budget, but the House budget looks nothing like Sununu’s plan.The only way a veto can be avoided is for the Senate to find some middle ground between the governor and House proposals. Sununu’s letter virtually assures that if the budget landing on his desk in June looks anything like the House-passed budget, a veto is coming.“Our initial conversations with members of the Senate have been positive,” Sununu writes, “and it is my hope that the Senate will pass a budget that continues our state on a path of economic success.”House Finance Committee Chairman Mary Jane Wallner, D-Concord, anticipates some compromise as well. She described the House budget as the Democrats’ opening offer.“We’re on the first step of a long journey,” she said at the budget briefing for House members last week. “It’s a long way between now and June 30, and a lot of different things will happen. So probably what you’ll see in the final version of the budget will look a lot different than what you’re seeing today.”Many agency heads got more money for their departments in the House budget than they got in Sununu’s budget, and his letter warns them to stick with the Executive Branch numbers as they begin their Senate testimony.“Please remember as you and your staff prepare for your Senate budget presentations that you should advocate for appropriation levels consistent with our proposed FY 2020-2021 budget,” he writes.“If there are programs that go beyond our proposed budget that you feel are worthwhile, you should propose realistic, programmatic reallocations from other areas of your agency.”The last time a governor vetoed a budget was in 2015, when Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan vetoed the budget passed by a Republican-led Legislature. Hassan signed a continuing resolution to fund state government for the next six months to avoid a shutdown.The two sides negotiated through the summer and struck a deal in September that saw Hassan get the pay raises for state employees that she wanted, while Republicans got the cuts in business taxes they wanted.The two sides this time around are far apart on business taxes, use of surplus funds from 2019, paid family and medical leave, education funding, DCYF positions, a secure psychiatric hospital and a host of other issues.The Senate’s reputation as a place where compromise is more likely and partisanship not as intense will be put to the test in the upcoming weeks, as senators try to craft a budget the governor will sign.dsolomon@unionleader.com"

Sununu backs funding effort to develop Balsams,"Apr 14, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/business/gov-sununu-backs-funding-effort-to-develop-balsams/article_0e301934-0159-5f56-8f4b-484e9d566b41.html,"Gov. Chris Sununu said he backs a measure that would provide a mechanism to help fund a $172 million renovation to The Balsams resort in Dixville Notch.“This bill has the potential to revitalize economic opportunity in the North Country without creating a burden on the taxpayers of New Hampshire and that is something we can all support,” Gov. Chris Sununu said in a statement to the New Hampshire Union Leader. “I would support this bill as written — should it reach my desk.”Last week, the Senate Commerce Committee voted 5-0 to back the measure. It could come up for approval before the full Senate this week.The bill would allow Coos County to issue a bond for the project without any guarantee for taxpayers to step in and make payments should the project fail. Tax revenues in a yet-to-be-created tax assessment district — also known as tax incremental financing (TIF) — would only come from the assets improved or built within that district, and those revenues would pay the principal and interest on the bond.“Coos County lost thousands of jobs in the last 15 years or so and despite numerous efforts, economic development has not kept young people,” said Rep. Edith Tucker, D-Randolph, who sponsored House Bill 540. “We need a big economist boost.”Les Otten, a one-time minority owner of the Boston Red Sox, has been working to resurrect the elegance of the shuttered Balsams, including requiring men to wear jackets in at least one restaurant should he complete his vision.The project’s first phase includes renovation of the Hampshire and Hale houses; reconstruction of Dix House; and construction of a 400-room Lake Gloriette House Hotel and Conference Center, Nordic baths and spa as well as a marketplace and expansion of the former Wilderness ski area.If the Senate and governor sign off on the bill, other steps would need to be completed before construction could start.“After that — there would be a process at the county level where the Commissioners would review the bond proposal,” said Scott Tranchemontagne, spokesman for the developer, Dixville Capital LLC.A public hearing would be held before the entire county delegation would also need to consider and approve the bond, he said.Besides the $28 million TIF bond, the project would be financed with an approximately $85 million construction loan, $20 million from the developer and $40 million in investment through a federal opportunity zone, a federal program that gives tax breaks to investors, or additional equity, according to Tranchemontagne in February.“With respect to funding, we have identified a great deal of it, but step one will be securing a buyer of the bond,” he said. “We are currently in discussions with a few potential bond investors. The bond will need to be purchased before any of the additional funding sources can close.”“It’s still a bit premature to speculate on a construction timeframe moving forward. We are very pleased with the Commerce Committee’s unanimous support,” Tranchemontagne said. “It is another significant step forward, but there are still several steps ahead.”Otten’s project tried to get the state Business Finance Authority to guarantee a $28 million loan but pulled the request last August before it came before a voteTucker said with the current plan, paying for the bond “won’t fall back on local taxpayers.”Coos County Commissioner Rick Samson said he supports renovating the Balsams but is “very worried” about the possibility of county taxpayers being on the hook if the developer doesn’t complete the project.As for the approvals from Concord, Samson said: “To be honest, I think what they’re doing is kick the can down the road for the Coos County commissioners and delegation to make the decision.”mcousineau@unionleader.com"

Chris Sununu addressed lawmakers about the state budget. They applauded when he said “Together we’ll continue to improve prevention of childhood lead poisoning.”Their applause is welcome news for supporters of House Bill 358, legislation that reduces the risk of lead exposure by restoring New Hampshire’s ban on burning construction and demolition debris (C&D) and its fuel byproducts.HB 358 passed the House, and it is now the Senate’s turn to support this important legislation.C&D is often contaminated with lead, a toxic metal for which there is no safe level of exposure. Combustion releases lead in a form that can be easily inhaled and ingested. C&D should never be burned.Current New Hampshire law allows 250 milligrams of lead in each kilogram of C&D approved for combustion. Burning 10,000 tons of C&D annually, as allowed at the Wheelabrator trash incinerator in Concord, can legally introduce 2.5 tons of lead into the environment in the form of air pollution, ash, leachate, and sludge.A proposed pyrolysis facility in Epping could process up to 146,000 tons of C&D each year to make waste-derived fuels. This is unacceptable.Restoring New Hampshire’s sensible ban on burning C&D and C&D fuels will reduce the risk of lead exposure.

Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,E-cig tax: A 'new' levy or loophole closer?,"Apr 13, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/politics/state/e-cig-tax-a-new-levy-or-loophole-closer/article_30e7ad6d-4f35-5694-b091-112ba04515ba.html,"CONCORD — Gov. Chris Sununu and the Democratic-led Legislature have fought bitterly over tax increases and tax cuts, but they seem to be in sync when it comes to one controversial hike.That’s to broaden the state’s tobacco tax to include e-cigarettes.Sununu, a two-term Republican, came into office campaigning to cut business taxes and to oppose any “new taxes.”This proposal, however, tucked into the so-called trailer bill (HB 2) of the state budget, would make New Hampshire the first state in New England and only the 10th nationally to tax e-cigarettes.The rate — 65 percent of the wholesale price — would be the second highest wholesale tax in the country, only lower than Minnesota at 90 percent.Victor Vitale runs a vaping store in Hudson.“I’ve lived in New Hampshire 21 years. I can never remember us rushing to be the first to tax anybody,” Vitale told the House Ways and Means Committee last month.“We will be taxing a product that helps people quit smoking. This is crazy,” he said.Sununu insisted he hasn’t broken his anti-tax pledge.“It’s not a new tax, it’s a new product. This commonsense update merely closes the existing loophole for new nicotine-based products so that these products are treated the same,” Sununu said in a statement.That’s not how Sununu’s GOP colleagues in the House of Representatives have seen it.The Democrat-controlled House initially endorsed a companion bill (HB 660) that would also impose the tax.House Republicans opposed it, 141-6.Rep. John Hunt, R-Rindge, is the former chairman of the House Commerce Committee.“The minority is not only opposed to the outrageous tax rate, but also the new definition of ‘tobacco products’ that the committee settled on that appears to also tax vaping equipment,” Hunt wrote last month.Unlike the other bill, Sununu’s proposal in the budget would exempt vaping equipment from the tax.House Republicans are already campaigning against Democrats who voted for the tax, such as first-term Rep. Cole Riel of Goffstown.“All the Republicans in Goffstown, Weare and Deering which I represent voted NO. Democrat Representative Cole Riel voted a BIG YES to tax your retail store and the tax payers more. 65.03% more,” Rep. John Burt, R-Goffstown, posted on social media after some Cumberland Farms owners mounted an e-campaign against the tax.


            States with tobacco excise taxes on e-cigarettesStates slow to actThe state chapter of the American Cancer Society and a host of other public health groups praised Sununu for his approach as the rates of young people trying vapor products continues to rise.“These are a new delivery system to get people addicted to nicotine. If they can be used by responsible adults exclusively to help them stop traditional smoking, that’s one thing, but they are not approved cessation devices,” said Mike Rollo, the state anti-cancer group’s lobbyist.“The governor deserves a lot of credit for recognizing what a public health threat this has become.”When e-cigarettes first came onto the market in 2007, states were slow to tax or regulate the products.Policymakers were unsure if vaping would catch on and also if it would be an effective way for adults to quit smoking cigarettes.Last January, the New England Journal of Medicine published findings from British researchers who concluded e-cigarettes worked nearly twice as well as nicotine patches and gum at helping smokers quit.In another study last February, however, American teens who used e-cigarettes were four times more likely at some point to try a regular cigarette.There are two basic forms of vaping products.The first is an open container system that allows the user to refill the liquid they inhale and also to adjust how much, if any, nicotine they want to take in.The closed system is a single-use vaping container that has a fixed amount of nicotine.In a relatively short period of time, Big Tobacco has cornered the market on these closed-system products.The No. 1 seller by far is Juul.Altria, the maker of Marlboro cigarettes and other brands, now has 35 percent ownership in Juul, and the brand is aggressively marketed on television and radio as a good way for adults to quit cigarettes.Critics say its flavored vapors are aimed at getting kids to try them.It’s illegal for anyone younger than 18 in New Hampshire to buy e-cigarettes.Third of 12th-graders vape“A custodian asked school officials in Franklin why are kids throwing away all their thumb drives. They are these Juul cartridges that are made to look like thumb drives,” said Rollo. “We’re also back to the Wild, Wild West again when Big Tobacco can freely go on TV and try to get kids hooked.”House Ways and Means Chairman Susan Almy, D-Lebanon, told her members her mission is simple.“We have to get rid of the Juuls and their equivalents, the closed systems, because there is an epidemic among our youth,” Almy said.According to the state’s risk behavior survey, nearly one quarter of New Hampshire’s youth vape, which is one of the highest rates in the country.Among high school seniors, 30% in New Hampshire said they regularly vape.But Brittany Adams, spokesman for the RAI Services Co., warned such a high tax could force smokers to quit vaping and go back to cigarettes.“We share New Hampshire’s concern about youth use of vapor products and believe that minors should never use vapor or any other tobacco products. However, the proposed vapor tax in HB2 would be anywhere from 82 to 248% higher than the state’s tax on cigarettes,” Adams said in a statement.“We urge legislators to consider the unintended consequences this proposal may have on adult smokers, such as deterring them from considering potentially less harmful products.”Vuse, another closed vape brand, is owned by the R.J. Reynolds Vapor Company a subsidiary of Reynolds American Inc. (RAI).Those supporting the business of refillable products say Big Tobacco could survive such a tax, but small vape shops will go under.Alex Moody, chief executive officer of Kinetik Labs of Franklin, said he sells products to retail stores in eight states that include 47 different levels of liquids down to some with no nicotine at all.“The cigarette tax is $1.78 a pack. This is going to equate to $7.88 per unit of an open vape system. That’s not sustainable,” Moody said.There’s evidence New Hampshire’s vape market is doing well.Healthy retail vape marketThe New England Vaping Association has 160 members; more than 60 of them are in New Hampshire.The N.H. Department of Revenue estimates the tax could raise $4.5 million in the first year and up to $7 million in the second.Officials admit it’s uncharted territory, and the real impact is unknown.Moody and others point out that Juul and other brands are bought online as well as in convenience stores.“People will just move and buy their Juuls on the internet and you’ll lose all that revenue,” he predicted.This campaign to pass the tax is by no means a done deal.The House retained until early next year the other bill (HB 660) due to questions over how to collect this tax.Almy said she’d like to figure out a way to exempt the vape shops from the levy. Legislative critics maintain that would be unconstitutional.House budget writers changed Sununu’s proposal to delay the tax until July 1, 2020.This came after the New Hampshire Grocers Association and convenience store owners warned New Hampshire would lose cross-border sales of not just these products if it gets out in front in New England with the first e-cig tax.Meanwhile, lawmakers in neighboring states have been making their own moves. Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker has proposed a 40% tax, and fellow Republican, Vermont Gov. Phil Scott, has endorsed a 92% tax.Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., filed legislation for the federal government to levy a new fee on tobacco companies to finance programs to warn Americans about the dangers of using e-cigarettes.“The increase in e-cigarette use among youth is staggering and the potential health effects are deeply disturbing. It’s past time to crack down on the culprits of this epidemic,” Shaheen said.In his federal budget, President Trump endorsed the fee to raise at least $100 million a year.“Let’s wait for the other states to raise (their) prices first before New Hampshire puts its level below our surrounding states,” urged John Dumais, president of the grocers lobby.“For 50 years that’s been a formula that’s worked for New Hampshire.”klandrigan@unionleader.com"

Some $400 million in new taxes are added, including a brand new capital gains tax and a disastrous reversal of promised business tax cuts.Even as New Hampshire tries to attract new businesses and expand existing ones, this plan to reverse promised tax reductions sends a terribly wrong signal. The Democrats then double-down on their anti-business policy by trying to impose a mandatory “family leave” plan.If this crowd sat down and deliberately tried to discourage private business in New Hampshire, it would have to work to beat what it has done here.A New Hampshire governor once stated the obvious: Low taxes are the result of low spending. But there is no low spending in the Democrats’ budget. It instead calls for much new spending.The one thing this budget attempted to cut was the money for a much-needed, and promised, secure psychiatric facility for the mentally ill. That was such a public relations fiasco that it has now restored money for planning the facility.Gov. Chris Sununu had wisely proposed using surplus funds from the current budget for one-time projects, thus not requiring recurring spending. The Democrats don’t like that idea, so they instead plan to build in new spending that will only increase, causing even more pressure for a state income tax.New Hampshire taxpayers have long reasoned that their wallets were safe because both party nominees for governor took the Pledge.That isn’t enough, not if they let spenders like this current bunch keep legislative power."

Chris Sununu said economic times were good in New Hampshire, and pointed to the state’s strong economy as a reason for Granite Staters to make a more concerted effort to support the work of the Nothing Campaign.“Everyone has a few extra bucks in their pocket — they really do,” said Sununu. “Most folks that walk through these grocery stores have the ability to spare five dollars for the can.”Sununu went on to say that the current state of the economy presents more reason than ever to remember the needs of those less fortunate in the state.“People don’t see homelessness outside their door all of the time; they don’t see some of the struggles that the families are having; they don’t see food insecurity every single day,” said Sununu.“But it’s there in each and every one of our communities whether you live in Portsmouth, Manchester or Colebrook. There’s folks in every community across the state that could use a little extra help.”Cans can be purchased at every Market Basket, Shaw’s, Hannaford and Harvest Market in the state, as well as Sully’s Superette in Goffstown and Allenstown and Vista Foods in Laconia."

Chris Sununu on several fronts, setting the stage for some hard bargaining and a potential impasse as the budget process winds toward the end of the current fiscal year on June 30.The governor and fellow Republicans in House and Senate oppose the elimination of business tax cuts, the additional educational aid and the capital gains tax to pay for it. The governor also has his own plan for paid family medical leave in collaboration with Vermont.The governor had 76 new positions at a cost of $12 million in his recommended budget, while the House budget calls for 157 new positions, mostly in health and human services, at a cost of $23 million.Democrats claimed Sununu did not adequately fund new positions needed in the Department for Children, Youth and Families to address a statewide crisis in child protection.Sununu uses $168 million in anticipated surplus from the current two-year budget to fund a variety of municipal projects, while the House blends that money into the next budget and revives a long-dormant revenue-sharing program that will send $12.5 million back to municipalities statewide.“From astronomical tax increases to unsustainable spending, House Democrats created a budget that will destroy the New Hampshire Advantage,” said Sununu. “Their budget slashes local investments and creates $400 million in new taxes. I call on the Senate Finance Committee to get to work and fix this mess.”Sununu’s reference to new taxes includes revenue that would be raised from the capital gains tax, the freeze on business tax cuts, the payroll withholding for FMLA and extension of the tobacco tax to e-cigarettes.The Democratically controlled Senate is likely to make some changes, but nothing on the scale proposed by Sununu.Small battles wonThe governor won two small battles on Thursday, as the House approved amendments that appropriate $1.2 million to plan and design a new secure psychiatric hospital, and $500,000 to fund the Internet Crimes Against Children task force.Sununu has been pushing for restoration of the full $26 million to build the new forensic unit on the grounds of New Hampshire Hospital in Concord. He also held a press conference in Nashua on Tuesday to criticize Democrats for their failure to fund the Crimes Against Children Task Force.House Majority Leader Doug Ley, D-Jaffrey, said the budget addresses issues that have been kicked down the road for years, at a time when the state can afford to do so.“This budget significantly increases public education funding, provides property tax relief for businesses and for our hard-working citizens, and addresses mental health and addiction issues, including funding for the preliminary planning and engineering studies for a new secure psychiatric unit,” he said.“And it establishes a sustainable family and medical leave program that will keep people from losing their job when they need to be with their family.”Both House and governor budgets total around $13 billion in state and federal sources over the two years, but the House plan spends $382 million more in state general and education funds, mostly coming from the $168 million in surplus and the estimated $150 million from the new capital gains tax.Sports betting OK’dThe Democrats say the capital gains tax is not a new tax, but an expansion of the state’s current levy on interest and dividends to include profits from the sale of stocks, bonds or real estate (not including primary residence).The House budget agrees with Sununu on authorizing sports betting in New Hampshire.It also provides funding for several mental health initiatives that both Republicans and Democrats agree on, including:• $10.5 million over the two years to implement key component of the 10-year-mental health plan;• $2 million to build new in-patient mental health beds;• $5 million to create a new inpatient psychiatric treatment facility for children;• $4 million to convert the children’s unit at New Hampshire Hospital to adult beds;• $2.5 million for 20 transitional housing units to serve people being discharged from New Hampshire Hospital to open up beds in the hospital; and• $1 million to help hospitals cope with emergency admission mental health patients waiting in emergency rooms for admission to New Hampshire Hospital.dsolomon@unionleader.com"

That’s how long New Hampshire’s mental health system has needed critical attention and investment.Civilly committed patients need to be removed from the secure psychiatric unit (SPU) located within the men’s prison in Concord. Patients who need admission to the state’s acute psychiatric facility, New Hampshire Hospital, are stuck in emergency departments for extended periods of time, waiting for a bed. Patients currently located at New Hampshire Hospital are waiting to be discharged to transitional housing, a step down on the transition back to the community. It’s a complicated problem with many moving parts.Which is why it’s bewildering that the New Hampshire House Finance Committee has stripped away funding for the all-encompassing solution put forth in Gov. Chris Sununu’s budget: $40 million in mental health funding, which provides for a new state forensic hospital facility, moving children out of New Hampshire Hospital to a more appropriate juvenile treatment setting, renovating the former children’s space to house more adults, and creating 40 transitional beds in communities around the state.Critics of the governor’s plan have latched on to the complexity of the issue to put off finally resolving this state’s mental health crisis, insisting a year-long study commission is required. The issue has been studied, the stakeholders have convened, the solution is ready, and New Hampshire’s families have been ready for 20 years. It is time to get going.RICHARD RANKINHudson"

DAVID LANE/UNION LEADER


CONCORD — A bill to repeal the death penalty in New Hampshire cleared the state Senate with a veto-proof, 17-6, two-thirds margin Thursday, setting the stage for the end of capital punishment in a state that hasn’t executed anyone since 1939.The House passed the repeal measure, HB 455, on March 3, also by a veto-proof vote of 279-88.Twelve Senate Democrats voted for the repeal bill along with Republicans John Reagan of Deerfield, Harold French of Franklin, Bob Giuda of Warren, David Starr of Franconia and Ruth Ward of Stoddard.Sen. Kevin Cavanaugh of Manchester was the only Democrat to vote against repeal. Democratic Sen. Lou D’Allesandro, also of Manchester, has voted against repeal in the past but was not present for Thursday’s vote.Gov. Chris Sununu has promised to veto the bill, but votes in the House and Senate signal he most likely will be powerless to stop the repeal from taking effect unless two senators change their minds for the override vote.

Now that the bill has cleared both chambers it need only be signed by the House Speaker, Senate President and Secretary of State before landing on Sununu’s desk, at which point he has five business days to veto, sign, or let the bill become law without a signature.A vote to override Sununu’s anticipated veto could take place later this month or next.The bill revokes the existing capital punishment statute and replaces it with a penalty of life in prison without the possibility of parole for murder of a police officer or other capital offenses.On death rowNew Hampshire currently has one person on death row — Michael Addison —who was sentenced to death for the 2006 killing of Manchester police officer Michael Briggs.Opponents of death penalty repeal argued that Addison will never be executed if capital punishment is repealed, while supporters of the repeal said the law would not be applied retroactively.

Addison’s fate has become a central issue in the death penalty debate, with Sen. Sharon Carson, R-Hudson, arguing the question would not have come up otherwise.“We have set such a high bar for the implementation of the death penalty that it has not been used in nearly 100 years,” she said.“So why is it so imperative now that we get rid of it? I will argue it’s because we have one individual on death row ... one individual who met the requirements that have been put into place by former legislators. He committed a heinous crime against a police officer.”Supporters of the repeal made little mention of Briggs, whose wife Laura testified against repeal before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Instead they focused on the broader reasons for their opposition to the death penalty.“State-sanctioned killing is cruel, ineffective and inherently flawed,” said Sen. Martha Hennessey, D-Hanover. “In committee we heard tragic, heart-wrenching testimony from those whose loved ones were murdered. Many testified that state killings do nothing to honor the lives of their loved ones.”The state currently has no means to carry out an execution.“The day this becomes law, Mr. Addison’s sentence will be converted to life in prison,” said Carson, visibly shaken by the anticipated outcome of the vote.“He will go to the U.S. District Court and argue equal protection and his sentence will be converted to life in prison. Please talk to Mrs. Briggs about that. She will not be able to speak to her husband again, whereas Mr. Addison will be able to talk to his family, have them come up to visit him.”A long historyIf the repeal bill becomes law, New Hampshire will be the 21st state to ban capital punishment.State Rep. Renny Cushing, D-Hampton, whose father was murdered in 1988, has been fighting to end the death penalty for decades. His brother-in-law was also murdered in Tennessee in 2011.

Jeanne Shaheen, D-NH, played the role of key inquisitor of Attorney General William Barr during a Senate Appropriations Committee hearing.Shaheen started by calling on Barr to assure the American people the Mueller report will be completely released as soon as possible.But then the state’s senior senator pressed him on reports the AG was forming a team to look into why federal investigators got the investigation of then-candidate Trump’s campaign rolling in the first place.Right around the same time Wednesday, Trump was telling reporters outside the White House the origin of the investigation was an “attempted coup” by federal investigators he said were guilty of treason.“Who is on that team, why have you felt the need to form such a team and what will be the scope of the investigation,” Shaheen asked Barr.Barr noted the Department of Justice’s Inspector General already had opened an inquiry into investigative methods that kicked off the $25 million Mueller report into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to alter the outcome of the 2016 election.But Barr said he wanted to “pull all the information together.”“Why did you feel the need to do that?” Shaheen asked.Barr answered, “Well, for the same reason we are worried about foreign influence in elections we want to make sure, I think spying on a political campaign is a big deal, a big deal.”A short time later Shaheen broke in with, “You are not suggesting though that spying occurred?”Barr paused and responded, “I don’t well, I guess, I think that spying did occur, yes I think spying did occur. The question is whether it was adequately predicated; I am not suggesting that it wasn’t adequately predicated. But I need to explore that.”Later Barr, who served as AG under former President George H. Bush, defended the FBI’s integrity.“This is not launching an investigation of the FBI, frankly to the extent there were any issues at the FBI I don’t view it as a problem that is endemic to the FBI,” Barr said.“I think there was probably a failure of a group of leaders there at the upper echelon because I don’t like to see attacks on the FBI.”Ex-Hassan Staffer revealed as Doxxing accompliceThe New Hampshire Sunday News first reported a Hassan staffer had served as a willing accomplice, helping a former staffer to burglarize Hassan’s office multiple times and using office computers to violate the personal privacy of five Republican senators over the Brett Kavanaugh hearings.We’ve confirmed that person was Samantha G. DeForest Davis, who had worked as a staff assistant in Hassan’s office from August 2017 until she was fired soon after the arrest of the ex-staffer Jackson Cosko last October.Cosko pleaded guilty to five federal felonies and will likely be sentenced to at least two years in federal prison this June.The Daily Caller reported there were court documents on file regarding Davis in U.S. District Court in Washington, DC, but as yet no charges filed against her.In Cosko’s case, Davis was only identified as “Subject A.”Hassan’s office has declined to comment on the woman’s identity other than to describe how the senator handled the matter.“We became aware of Subject A’s involvement shortly after Cosko’s arrest. As soon as we were aware, the individual was removed from our office and ultimately fired,” said Hassan spokesman Aaron Jacobs.According to her Linkedin profile, Samantha DeForest Davis’ hometown is Beloit, Wisc.She attended Augustina College in Rock Island, Ill. as a political science major, serving as speaker of the college’s Senate until she stepped down from that position for an internship in Washington, D.C.Republican State Chairman Stephen Stepanek said there should be an investigation in the background of Hassan’s entire staff.”If there is one former staffer there’s smoke, a second staffer there’s fire, and how do we know if the vetting was done any better with everyone who is on her staff,” Stepanek said.Sununu praises GOP senator, slights NH’s delegationThe animosity between Gov. Chris Sununu and the Democratic congressional delegation has been building in recent months.This has surely been fueled by the fact Sununu remains the only chief executive in New England who failed to support a multi-state lawsuit challenging Trump’s move to divert federal spending to build a wall on the southern border.State Democratic leaders have tried to get Sununu to jump aboard that suit, warning that three construction projects at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard worth $162 million were potentially at risk through the President’s budget gambit.So it was little wonder then when Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, declared the shipyard projects are fine, Sununu knew who to credit for the save.“Senator Susan Collins has shown exemplary leadership in receiving assurances that these critical projects are on track,” Sununu said in a statement Wednesday morning. “I would like to extend my sincere thanks to Senator Collins for taking action and her dedication to keeping these Portsmouth Naval Shipyard projects moving forward.”Shaheen spokesman Ryan Nickel didn’t comment about Sununu’s remarks, but did say it’s too early to celebrate that the Portsmouth shipyard was out of the woods.“It’s certainly encouraging that military officials continue to indicate that shipyard projects are on track to be awarded in this fiscal year,” Nickel said in a statement. “Unfortunately, nothing currently prevents the Trump administration from raiding this funding until the awards are made, which is why there’s been bipartisan concern about the shipyard losing urgently needed resources.“It’s not uncommon for awards for military construction projects to be delayed several months or more, including at the shipyard. Sen. Shaheen will continue to advocate for the shipyard being removed from the Trump administration’s border wall funding list and encourage the Department of Defense to lock in the funding for shipyard projects.”Another week, another Sununu campaign rumorBarely a week goes by without still more speculation about Governor Sununu’s political future, namely whether he’s running for reelection as governor, running for the U.S. Senate against Shaheen or riding off into the sunset in 2020.WMUR reported earlier Wednesday that sources had told the station that Sununu assured GOP figures he definitely was running for a third term as the state’s chief executive next year.As soon as that report was put on Twitter, however, Sununu himself knocked it down with a statement reading in part, “I have absolutely made no decision on my future in public service. Whether I run for reelection, for the U.S. Senate or go back to the private sector — I will make that decision later this spring with Valerie and the kids.”As we reported a week ago, Sununu sure sounded like someone heavily engaged in state and not national politics at the state GOP fundraiser in Nashua.Then the guest of honor, Trump’s daughter-in-law Lara Lea Trump, told reporters she hoped Sununu would run for governor again.There are other national GOP figures, however, who want Sununu to keep this “I may run for Senate” out there as the effort continues to identify a solid, well-financed alternative Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate seat.Sununu has decided, however, he’s not going to allow this timetable to drag on too much longer.You may remember in 2015 then NH Gov. Maggie Hassan made plenty of out-of-state fundraising trips in 2015 but she didn’t confirm until October of that year she was going to challenge then-U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-NH.Why? Hassan ended up vetoing a state budget and that State House dispute kept her on the political sidelines.Now we see Sununu is in the middle of an already-bitter state budget battle of his own with Democratic legislative leaders.Sununu is well aware that if he’s going to run for governor again and lead the effort to try and take the Legislature and Executive Council out of Democratic hands next year, the sooner all of that can officially get underway the better.Buttigieg numbers catch fire in NHA new independent poll from Saint Anselm College’s New Hampshire Institute of Politics reveals Pete Buttigieg really is on a roll, getting noticed in this ever-expanding 2020 Democratic presidential field.The South Bend, Ind. mayor leaped to third place in a horse race poll done April 3-8 with a total of 698 registered voters.He had 10.7 percent, behind only 2016 New Hampshire primary winner Bernie Sanders at 15.6 percent and former Vice President Joe Biden with 22.9 percent.Those with no opinion were actually third-highest, since 13.2 percent gave that answer.Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., was in fourth with 8.7 percent.The margin of error is plus or minus 5.4 percent.Timing was everything and to be sure the media furor over Buttigieg of late surely didn’t hurt how he did in this poll.For starters, Buttigieg tweeted on April 4 he’d be making a “special announcement” April 14 in South Bend.Then he headed east and sold out an appearance on the campus of Northeastern University in Boston.By the following day organizers had to move his first of two events in New Hampshire to the Currier Museum of Art in Manchester.While Buttigieg was here April 5-6, the only other major Democratic hopefuls in the state while this poll was being taken were New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker (4.4 percent) and New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (1 percent).Shaheen’s fans return attack ad fireIn 2016, the Senate Majority PAC spent a record $15.9 million on Hassan’s behalf, outspending by $6 million what the Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee spent to try to help Ayotte.So when a socially conservative Super PAC, Americas PAC, bankrolled a $290,200 radio ad buy attacking Shaheen’s support for abortion rights, you had to know the Senate Majority PAC wasn’t going to sit idly by and not answer.The pro-Shaheen team has bought $200,000 of radio ads that will run on stations across the state for the next two months.”They’re back. Already shameful political attacks paid for by out-of-state billionaires,” the pro-Shaheen ad begins.”Out-of-state billionaires twisting the facts about Senator Jeanne Shaheen’s record on health care.”On Tuesday, Shaheen’s campaign announced she raised a record, $1.4 million in donations for her reelection, more than any other New Hampshire incumbent senator raised in the quarter this far ahead of the election.There were 8,600 donors and 92 percent were less than $100, according to Rachel Berger, Shaheen’s finance directorKlobuchar staffs up in NHU.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar’s 2020 presidential campaign has made three key staff hires in the first-in-the-nation primary state.Scott Merrick will be state director for the Minnesota senator’s campaign here, having served as deputy state director for Shaheen, along with five years as a NH House member from Coos County. Most recently he’s been vice president of business development for Athenium Analytics, a Dover-based technology company.Sondra Milkie will be deputy director. She recently managed a Maryland congressional race, along with working as a digital and direct-mail consultant in D.C.Ben Ernst will be the campaign’s political director and served in that role for the NH Democratic Party.

Jon Morgan came on board the campaign after having gone to several events hosted by other candidates.NH Senate Dem promoting capital gains taxFirst term Sen. Jeanne Dietsch, D-Peterborough, pushed back at Sununu’s opposition to a capital gains tax, maintaining it could help attract younger workers back to New Hampshire by making key investments in education and other programs.As proposed, the tax would extend the 5 percent interest and dividends tax to capital gains with a high deduction to exempt earnings of seniors and lower-income citizens.She recalled coming to the state during the mid-1980s when she said the state was a magnet for young people.”People like us, in their thirties, were pouring into the state,” Dietsch recalled in a commentary to her constituents.”Now our state is 48th in Millennial population. State Treasurer (William) Dwyer reports that New Hampshire’s workforce growth for the decade was a third of our neighbor’s to the south. Crime is up. Opioid use and suicide beleaguers us. Schools are closing from lack of funds. We’re 35th in venture capital investment and 44th in single-family building permits.”klandrigan@unionleader.com"

MacDonald wrote in the lawsuit.“The 2018 Opinion’s interpretation of the Wire Act also intrudes upon the sovereign interests of the state of New Hampshire without unmistakably clear language demonstrating that Congress intended such a result.”In that Nov. 2 opinion, Assistant U.S. Attorney General Steven Engel fully conceded this decision overturns a 2011 guidance from the same office, which concluded that only interstate sports betting was in violation.The New Hampshire case has drawn dozens of “amicus” — or “friends of the court” — briefs from states and private vendors who wanted a quick legal resolution to clarify that lotteries, whether in-state or national versions such as Powerball or Mega Millions, were not jeopardized by this DOJ memo.Some legal experts wonder if the Trump administration’s chief target with this memo initially was to try to block online casino gambling that could potentially explode with the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that allows states to legalize sports betting.Gov. Chris Sununu is counting on sports betting to generate $10 million in the next two-year state budget he’s proposed.The New Hampshire House of Representatives has endorsed the sports betting bill that’s pending in the State Senate.klandrigan@unionleader.coma"

According to the letter from Associate Attorney General Jeffrey Strelzin, director of the division of public protection, Smart was properly convicted to a life behind bars and that’s where she should stay.Smart is not asking for a pardon, but a modification of her sentence to eliminate the requirement that she serve life “without the possibility of parole.” If the sentence can be commuted in that way, she hopes to some day apply for parole.Smart was convicted by a Rockingham County jury in 1991 of accomplice to first-degree murder, conspiracy to commit murder and tampering with a witness, in connection with the shooting death of her 24-year-old husband of less than a year, Gregory Smart.Now 51, she remains behind bars at the maximum-security women’s prison in Bedford Hills, N.Y.Jurors found her guilty of orchestrating her husband’s murder with the help of a 15-year-old lover and three of his teenage friends, who tried to make the fatal shooting look like a botched robbery. The plot unraveled and the ensuing trial attracted worldwide interest.Smart appealed her conviction all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which declined to hear the case. She filed her first petition for commutation in 2004 and started the process for the current petition in February 2018.Smart’s mother, Linda Wojas, is hoping the council at least agrees to a hearing.“I’m 77 years old, and my daughter has been in jail half her life, while the boys who admitted killing her husband are all free,” she said on Wednesday. “Article 18 in the criminal code of New Hampshire states the true design of all punishment is to rehabilitate and not exterminate.”"
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,Kathy Sullivan: Big decisions for Sununu,"Apr 10, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/opinion/columnists/kathy-sullivan-big-decisions-for-sununu/article_67fbd0d3-a61f-5239-86e6-dfb7710e9bfe.html,"GOV. CHRIS SUNUNU is going to be under a lot of pressure the next few weeks.There will be continued debate over the state budget. There are other bills, such as marijuana legalization, paid family and medical leave and some gun reform law, making their way through the legislature that he opposes.At the same time, he is going to have to decide on his political future. The Republicans in Washington want him to run for the United States Senate. New Hampshire Republicans, on the other hand, may think it is in the best interest of their party’s long-term health if he runs for re-election. There also is a third possibility, which is that Sununu, who has a young family, might say he has done his public service — at least for now — and opt to enjoy a more private and lucrative life in the private sector.It makes sense that national party leaders want Sununu to run for the Senate. No one else has the statewide name recognition and fundraising capacity, other than Kelly Ayotte or Sununu’s brother, John, the former senator. But neither of them seem interested.After that, the bench is pretty empty.A U.S. Senate race is a tough slog, however. According to the campaign finance site Open Secrets, the total raised and spent by each candidate in the 2016 Hassan/Ayotte race topped $18 million. The 2020 race will only be more expensive.Raising that kind of money requires significant time on the phone and meeting with donors around the country. It is all-consuming and exhausting, taking the candidate away from home a lot more than a gubernatorial race.It would be a tough election. While both Sen. Jeanne Shaheen and Sununu are popular, New Hampshire is trending Democratic. In the 2014 midterms, an off-year for Democrats nationally, Shaheen beat a well-financed Scott Brown. In 2018, Maggie Hassan defeated a popular incumbent, Kelly Ayotte. Plus, Shaheen has won five statewide races.Adding to the uncertainty is that 2020 is a presidential election year. Right now, Donald Trump looks to be a drag on the ticket. That makes it a tougher race.Running for re-election poses some of the same challenges, such as the impact of the Trump candidacy. Democratic candidates are already lining up to run. Former candidates Molly Kelly and Steve Marchand have set up new political action committees. Senate Majority Leader Dan Feltes is giving every indication of running. Another strong candidate would be Senate President Donna Soucy. Executive Councilor Andru Volinsky also might be interested.But Sununu seems to enjoy the job for the most part. And, if he does not run for re-election, Republican chances of holding the seat plummet.The most likely Republican candidates would be state Sen. Chuck Morse and Education Commissioner Frank Edelblut. Given Edelblut’s surprisingly strong finish in the 2016 primary, and the ever more rightward swing of the state’s GOP base, Edelblut would be the frontrunner in a GOP primary.That is not a helpful development for Republicans. Edelblut is even further to the right than Ovide Lamontagne and John Stephen, who both lost their races for governor. A Trump/Edelblut ticket could have a devastating impact on down-ticket races.If 2020 is a Democratic wave year, Democrats could end up controlling the legislature and the governor’s office — and redistricting. Republicans gerrymandered the heck out of the legislative and Executive Council districts 10 years ago.Despite that Republican structural advantage, Democrats managed to capture majorities in 2012 and 2018. If the Democrats were to win control of redistricting in 2020, and all they do is design fairer districts, Republicans could find themselves in the legislative and council minority for years to come.Sununu has a lot to chew on as he weighs his decision."

Chris Sununu had placed $500,000 in his budget for the New Hampshire Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force, but the House Finance Committee recently removed the funding from his proposed spending plan.The money is necessary to purchase equipment and train law enforcement on how to investigate crimes such as the manufacturing, possession and distribution of child pornography, as well as child enticement cases, according to detective John Peracchi, commander of the NH ICAC Task Force and a member of the Portsmouth Police Department.During a press conference on Tuesday in Nashua, Peracchi said that up to 75 percent of individuals who look at child pornography have victimized at least one child. Without the $500,000 in funding, the ICAC Task Force would be crippled, and police departments throughout the state would not have the resources to investigate these critical cases, he said.“The Legislature has made a huge mistake,” said Sununu, maintaining the ICAC Task Force is on the front lines protecting children against online predators.During its first year in operation, the team was successful in working many cases in Manchester, Portsmouth and Nashua, the governor said, adding that the system works.Money should be the last thing worrying the ICAC Task Force team, he said.“The Democrats’ removal of this money is unconscionable,” he said. “... We are finally turning the tide that we just didn’t have a handle on for such a long time.”Since its inception on July 1, 2018, there have been 286 ICAC investigations, 30 operations, 142 search warrants and 404 cyber tips, said Peracchi.There have also been nearly 430 cellphones processed, 35 cases of child enticement, 102 cases of possession of child abuse image, 75 cases of distribution of child pornography, and 45 cases of manufacturing, according to Peracchi.With children having easy access to cellphones, and with social media use on the rise, he said more children are at risk of becoming victim to online predators.The problem is only going to get worse, he said, adding the ICAC Task Force is instrumental in curbing some of that online activity.Mark Chase, president of the New Hampshire Association of Chiefs of Police, said his agency is urging legislators to return the funding that is aimed to protect New Hampshire’s children, and serves as the first line of defense against online predators.Hillsborough County Sheriff James Hardy echoed those comments. He maintained that few law enforcement agencies in New Hampshire would be able to support the costs of these extensive investigations on their own.On average, there are 10,000 downloads of pornographic child material each day in New Hampshire — a number that the ICAC Task Force is working to decrease, said Matt Fleming of the Bedford Police Department.The House is expected to vote on a proposed $12.9 billion, two-year budget on Thursday. Sununu’s proposed budget was $13.1 billion.NashuaNews@unionleader.com"
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,"Sununu, lawmakers at odds over how to spend $168M state surplus","Apr 9, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/politics/state/sununu-lawmakers-at-odds-over-how-to-spend-m-state/article_49b73efc-bb7f-526c-af82-630ea748bd55.html,"CONCORD — As the Democratically controlled House prepares to vote Thursday on its version of a two-year state budget, Republican Gov. Chris Sununu is stepping up his lobbying in support of the revenue and spending plan he submitted to the state Legislature in February.The two sides are far apart on several big issues, including what to do with a $168 million surplus the state anticipates at the end of the current two-year cycle on June 30.Sununu would like to dole most of it out in one-time grants to cities and towns for projects identified as worthy investments by local officials.Democrats in the state Legislature want to carry that balance over into the next budget, mostly to fund an increase in education aid to local school districts.At a news conference in Claremont on Monday, Sununu was joined by Mayor Charlene Lovett and other local officials, as he again urged lawmakers to approve the many projects he’s earmarked for surplus spending, including three in Claremont.The city is in line for $100,000 in energy efficiency upgrades at the Arrowhead Recreation Area, $30,000 for upgrades to the Claremont visitors’ center, and $120,000 for sidewalk and drainage repairs.“We don’t know how Gov. Sununu chose to hand out his proposed projects, because the projects were picked without vetting and without criteria, but he left far too many Granite Staters out,” says House Finance Committee Chairman Mary Jane Wallner, D-Concord.“Instead of picking winners and losers in our budget, we are giving money back to local communities, so they can decide how to best address their most urgent needs.”The House budget revives a long-dormant revenue-sharing program that will send $12.5 million back to municipalities statewide while increasing education funding by $164 million.“Gov. Sununu’s budget appropriated $250,000 for three projects in Claremont, while the House budget gives Claremont $233,000 in revenue-sharing that they can use for any project plus an additional $5.3 million in education aid,” according to Wallner.Two sides far apartWallner led a presentation on the budget in Representatives Hall on Tuesday, the same day Sununu was appearing at a news conference in Nashua with law enforcement officials to protest the removal of funding for the Internet Crimes Against Children task force by the House Finance Committee.At Tuesday’s budget presentation, Rep. Debra Altschiller, D-Stratham, asked about the lack of funding for the task force. The $500,000 appropriation for the ICAC was among the earmarks from surplus in the governor’s Infrastructure Revitalization Fund.“I’m concerned that the Internet Crimes Against Children task force isn’t represented in the budget,” said Altschiller. “We know this is a crucial part of protecting children. In just the past year, the task force has identified 102 cases of possession of child abuse images.”Rep. Patricia Lovejoy, who heads the Finance Committee subdivision that deals with the Department of Justice, said the DOJ did not press for task force funding.“We rely on our agencies, and the Attorney General’s office did not list this as one of their priorities,” said Lovejoy. “If it’s something you are concerned about, it’s an issue to bring up with the Senate when the budget passes over to them.”Assuming the House passes its version of the budget on Thursday, the document (more than 900 pages) then moves over to the Senate. The House and Senate will have to reconcile their differences, pass the same budget, and hand it over to Sununu by June 30.The governor and legislature are so far apart, it’s possible that Sununu could veto the budget, as Gov. Maggie Hassan did in 2015, setting the stage for some hard bargaining over the summer.“We’re on the first step of a long journey,” said Wallner. “It’s a long way between now and June 30, and a lot of different things will happen. So probably what you’ll see in the final version of the budget will look a lot different than what you’re seeing today.”Different philosophiesRepublicans are concerned that by blending the $168 million surplus into the next biennial budget, Democrats are setting the stage for permanent growth in government that will have to be funded through new taxes somewhere down the line.“In the last biennium we ended up with a surplus and we use that surplus in the next biennium,” said Wallner. “We cannot predict what the Senate will do; we cannot predict what the governor will do; and we can’t predict precisely how our revenues will come in during the next two years. We have good predictions, but we don’t know for sure.”The governor’s budget calls for $4.8 billion in spending from state revenue sources over the two years, compared to House appropriation of $5.5 billion.The governor’s 2020-21 budget does not include the $168 million in 2018-19 surplus, which would be spent in FY 2019; it does not include a new capital gains tax proposed by Democrats, and expected to raise about $150 million a year; and it does not include a claw-back of scheduled reductions in business taxes for 2019 and 2021.The governor’s budget calls for ending FY 2021 with $137 million in the Rainy Day, while the House budget estimates a balance of $116 million.dsolomon@unionleader.com"

Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,Poetry and politics: Sununu's nomination for poet laureate has a decidedly different political bent,"Apr 7, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/politics/state/poetry-and-politics-sununu-s-nomination-for-poet-laureate-has/article_02e6b372-f0f9-587c-bae4-eb8ef3fc8f97.html,"CONCORD — The question of who will become the state’s new poet laureate remains unresolved, as Gov. Chris Sununu and the Poetry Society of New Hampshire are still at odds over the nomination.Sununu surprised the Poetry Society earlier this year when he nominated poet Daniel Thomas Moran of Webster to the honorary position. Moran, nominated by a Seacoast-area retiree, had read one of his poems at Sununu’s second inauguration in January.Moran was not the society’s nominee, nor was he on its short list. The Poetry Society’s nomination and selection process, which has been used to name poet laureates in the past, led to the recommendation of Jennifer Militello of Goffstown.Both Moran and Militello have declined to comment on the process.“We’re trying to set up a meeting to meet with the board of the Poetry Society, we’re working on a date there. I even offered to go to their next board meeting,” said Sununu in a recent interview. “Everything’s on the table.”Sununu referred to Moran, born in New York City in 1957, as a “young, engaging guy who really has done a lot. I’m not a poetry expert, but I’m a big fan and think he would do the state an immense service being the poet laureate.”The Poetry Society is standing behind its first choice, Militello. Poetry Society President Don Kimball describes her as an accomplished poet with a national reputation.













Jennifer Militello


 


“A noted educator, she has an impressive publication history, is founder of the New Hampshire Poetry Festival, now in its fourth year, and is highly respected by the New Hampshire poetry community,” according to her nomination.Kimball says efforts to meet with the governor have so far been unsuccessful.“There was a meeting scheduled for the governor and the Selection Committee at the end of March, but the governor’s office had a conflict and we’ve been trying to reschedule with them,” he said.“We understand they are very busy but the Selection Committee still hopes to meet with them soon. We do urge the governor to nominate Ms. Militello, whose name emerged after a rigorous and time-honored selection process.”Poetry Society members have flooded the executive council with emails and letters in support of their choice, while Moran has his supporters as well. One showed up at the last council meeting with a sign on her back that read “I’m an N.H. Dan Moran Poetry Fan.”“I don’t know the governor’s reasons for choosing his candidate over the committee’s recommended poet (or the three other finalists),” writes New Hampshire author Rebecca Rule, in a letter to her councilor, Ted Gatsas.“I do know that to ignore this recommendation sends a message to the arts community that our hard work and expertise are not valued. The title Poet Laureate will be tarnished because the process was circumvented. The Poet Laureate program will be undercut and diminished.”If Moran is nominated, it won’t be due to any shared political philosophy with the governor, as the poet’s twitter feed is well-populated with anti-Trump tweets like these @DanielThosMoran:“The important question is how many Americans have become fat or alcoholic, or clinically insane because @realDonaldTrump became President?Trump is loved by his supporters for being a tough guy. He is no tough guy. He is a thin-skinned wimp who whines like a 14-year-old girl.”Moran’s nomination may be more a matter of social, rather than political, connections. He and the governor’s wife Valerie both serve on the board of the New Hampshire Humanities Council.Militello has some Democratic-leaning political content on her Twitter feed as well, with a handful of posts or retweets like this one around the 2016 election.@JenifrMilitello: My Twitter feed feels like a big, happy #DNC family right now.

Nearly 350 teens from public, private and charter schools across New Hampshire spent the day talking about some of the most difficult issues they’re facing today: bullying, school violence, gender identity, race and addiction. And they did so with candor and compassion.On his way in to the Grappone Center for the summit, Connor Gatlin, 15, from the Making Community Connections charter school in Keene, had a goal for the day: “I hope we find some things we need to fix, and we find a way to fix it.”They certainly made a good start. Over the course of the morning, students met in small groups to tackle their choice of topics. There were adults assigned to each group, but it was the students themselves who led the discussions and pushed for solutions.Quincy Roy, a sophomore at Manchester Memorial High, led a session on school violence. While New Hampshire has not experienced a school shooting, students said the impact of tragedies in other states has been felt here.

Stephanie Flegal, a senior at Goffstown High, said talking about which rooms in schools would be safe if a shooter entered the building has become “normal lunch conversation.”“There’s so much anxiety these days with kids in school, they can’t even focus on the work they’re doing,” she said. “It’s pretty scary.”And it’s not just gun violence. Maya Weil-Cooley, a junior at Inter-Lakes High, said there was a fight on the grounds of her school a few months ago. “Everybody stood around and videoed it,” she said. “It was crazy to watch … how normalized it was … It felt scary to see people using it for entertainment and cheering them on.”The prevalence of vaping came up in a discussion about addiction. Students said schools should do more to help students who get caught drinking or using drugs instead of punishing them.

Danielle Santiago, a junior at Alvirne High, said she lost her best friend because of substance abuse. “She was drinking, vaping and smoking marijuana,” she said. And when she tried to convince her friend she was hurting herself, she said, “she chose the drugs over me.”Many students said they think schools should address issues such as race, gender identity and healthy eating in classes. In a session on eating disorders, teens said advertising and other media present body images that negatively influence how teens see themselves.Nika Mitchell from Concord High School said someone can be beautiful even if they’re not “average” size. “I feel as though you should be teaching everybody it’s not the size that matters,” she said. “It matters how healthy you are.”But Estela Raya-Fouts, a junior at Trinity High in Manchester, said her school doesn’t even offer health classes. A lot of girls “go on these crazy diets,” she said. “They don’t know what it takes to be a healthy person.”

In a session on race and ethnicity, Jaeda Bastien from Raymond High, said there’s a generation gap. “Our generation is very much about embracing diversity and our differences,” she said. Her parents and grandparents, she said, “were raised in a very racist world.”But she said the only two things she ever learned in school about other races were negative: slavery and how Native Americans were mistreated.Raven Strother from Lakes Region School District brought up a recent incident at a New Hampshire high school in which students wrote a song about the KKK for a class project. “That’s a horrible situation that definitely made a lot of people in our state feel very uncomfortable and very alarmed,” she said. “Something didn’t go right with their education, with their family, their school, their friends, thinking that was an OK way to express history.”The idea for the Youth Summit came out of the work of John Broderick, the former Chief Justice of the New Hampshire Supreme Court who is now senior director of public affairs at Dartmouth-Hitchcock. For the past three years, Broderick has visited high schools and community organizations across the state and shared his own family’s story to raise awareness of mental health.Broderick was on hand for the duration of Friday’s summit. And mental health was a frequent topic of conversation.

Kenney Paquette, a junior at Pelham High, said he has suffered from anxiety but he was reluctant at first to get help “because I didn’t want the label.”“People are forced to hide their mental illness and not get the help they need, so they enter their jobs, law enforcement or the military with their mental illnesses untreated,” he said.One group talked about the pressures students feel, from school, parents, sports, but mostly from themselves. Students shared ideas for relieving stress: reading, playing music, going for a run, taking a bath.Stella Hazelton, a junior at Salem High, said she’s learning to keep things in perspective when something goes wrong, such as a bad grade on a test. “You’re going to have a life in the future, and you can’t put everything on this one test,” she said.The day’s activities concluded with the Magnify Voices film and writing festival, featuring the top 10 winners of a student contest on the topic of mental health. First Lady Valerie Sununu, who hosted the ceremony, embraced the winners, clearly moved by their poems, essays and films.The following high school teams created winning videos: Grace Lumley and Valerie Sacco; Emma Jane Tagliaferro; Colin Chau, Christian Pfeuti and Nate Caston; Griffin Hansen, Stephanie Flegal and Tori Flegal; Anna Carroll; and Bre Paquette, who also won the People’s Choice award for her film. Winners of the writing contest were Ella Livengood, Destiny Brewer, Mia Flegal and Austin Klowak, all middle-schoolers.The students will be honored at the Fisher Cats baseball game on May 5 in Manchester, and the winning films will be shown.Sununu applauded the courage of the youngsters who shared their personal stories of struggling with mental illnesses. “I’m stunned by all of you, and all of your bravery,” she said. “I really can’t talk right now.”Gov. Chris Sununu opened the Youth Summit by calling on the students to carry the work of the day forward into their schools and communities. “Your voice means a lot,” he said. “You wouldn’t be here if you didn’t believe it.”"

After years of work by the non-partisan Campaign for a Family Friendly Economy, the support of NH working families and small businesses, and with scrutiny and revisions by legislators on both sides of the aisle, paid family medical leave soon can become reality in the Granite State.The plan, based on actuarial studies, is financially solvent and has multiple options for implementation by employers to provide up to 12 weeks of paid family or medical leave for employees.SB 1 now awaits Gov. Chris Sununu’s signature. Since he expressed support for family medical leave insurance during his first term, that would seem likely at this stage. Instead, a campaign against SB 1 threatens to derail this law.The NH GOP is misrepresenting employee payroll deductions for the insurance — the same mechanism used for unemployment insurance — as an income tax. Using that label is designed to anger Granite Staters who passionately support “no income tax” for our state. The benefits of the bills are lost in this intentional, inflammatory rhetoric.That label obscures the immediate and long-term benefits of this bill — a paycheck and job security.A lengthy illness, aging parents or frequent medical trips for children are challenging. Having no money to pay bills or losing a job because of an extended absence is devastating.Tell the governor you support Paid Family Medical Leave.Tell him to sign SB 1.CARLA BILLINGHAMSalem"

“It course-corrected me as a young adult. It shaped the way I do business, the way I raise my family, and what I say to my staff members,” said Obrey, now a motivational speaker as well as a business leader, who served as a Mayhew trustee for 10 years. “It taught me how to bring the best out in others, and how to be my best self at all times. It’s a life-changing place.”It’s also a program that has gained national attention at a time when rapidly increasing numbers of young people are churning through poverty, family chaos, trauma and neglect, and the opioid crisis is unraveling more.The Mayhew Program, and its counterpart, The Circle Program for girls, and Families in Transition-New Horizons, which provides shelter, transitional housing, and support to homeless families in New Hampshire, are featured in a PBS special, “Our Kids: Narrowing the Opportunity Gap,” airing today at 11 am on NH PBS Explore, Channel 11.2.The four-part series, running Sunday mornings through April, highlights efforts from Manchester to Riverside, Calif., that are bridging the ever-widening “opportunity gap” between children of middle-class and wealthy families and those who struggle at or below poverty level without advantages that most parents and children count as standard.The series is the brainchild of Robert Putnam, Harvard professor of public policy and author of the bestsellers, “Bowling Alone” and “Our Kids.” Its goal is to share information on what can effectively combat the problem — real-life struggles and successes of communities taking sustainable action to salvage and bolster young lives teetering on the abyss.“The idea is for other communities to look at a solution, and say, ‘If they can do that, why can’t we do that, too?’” said Harry Wiland, an executive producer and co-director of the series, produced by the Media Policy Center and narrated by Putnam.The call to action can’t come too soon. The numbers of at-risk youngsters are staggering: About 21 percent of American children — and close 60 percent of children in Manchester — live in families at or below the federal poverty level.Nearly a third of the U.S. population cannot read above the fourth-grade level, and students age 16 to 24 from low-income families are seven times more likely to drop out of school than pupils from higher-income households, national research shows.At least a third of children in homeless shelters have parents struggling with addiction.Eighty-five percent of homeless families, including in New Hampshire, are single mothers with children.“If we don’t empower them” with education, self esteem, values that include helping others and critical tools for success such a having goals and positive role models, “the incarceration is going to continue, the recidivism is going to continue,” and the drug issue, teen pregnancy and overdosing will persist. “We’re just going to have a society of young people that are lost,” said Lynette Jones at Riverside California’s Eureka Project House, also highlighted in the program.Nurturing transitionsMaureen Beauregard, executive director of Families in Transition-New Horizons, founded Families in Transition 27 years ago, when there were roughly 50 homeless people looking for housing in New Hampshire. In 2018, there were 1,328, including 143 homeless children.In the Granite State, daily life without a permanent home means camping outdoors in warm weather, sleeping in cars, and “couch surfing” in colder months, bedding down at houses and apartments of family and friends until it’s time to move on.“Every time a child moves, they lose,” Beauregard said. “You’re leaving everything behind again and again.”The experience typically means changing schools, with little opportunity to make lasting friends, or learn the social skills and confidence required to find new ones. Children often end up below-grade academically. That only increases their shame and sense of not belonging.Day to day problems become overwhelming. “Am I going to sleep if I’m living here and here and here?” said Beauregard, a veteran of the foster care system, who eventually found her way to college and a career helping families like her own.“I talk to a lot of school-age kids who are sad they can’t have play dates, sleepovers, or birthday parties,” said Kristin McGuigan, child and family program manager for FIT-New Horizons, with transitional housing in Wolfeboro, Dover, Concord and Manchester that bridges the gulf between life in a shelter and having a permanent home.Group birthday parties are held for children living in FIT’s transitional housing. “We try to create joyful, memorable experiences for children” in stable, safe environments with wraparound services that prepare families for independence, McGuigan said.Early-childhood specialists model play and bonding activities for struggling, alienated parents, many of whom have attachment issues stemming from their own early lives. Social workers advocate for the children at school, so teachers and administrators can intervene in sympathetic and effective ways when a student is in distress or acting out.Thanks to Families in Transition-New Horizons, Ashley, a single mother of three — two school-age boys and a 2-year-old girl — sees her future unfolding positively. She lived in an orphanage between age 4 and 18, then camped behind the Everett Arena in Concord before moving to a shelter and finding FIT-New Horizons.She’s spent the last four years in the program’s transitional housing. Counselors are helping her locate a permanent 3-bedroom rental. After working at Wendy’s for six years, she now teaches at a day care center and is completing a degree in early childhood education at Granite State College.“Families in Transition was life-changing for me,” said Ashley, who asked that her last name not be used. “They gave me a lot of resources and the motivation to do better for my boys. It’s been the most help I’ve ever had.”Last week she spoke at a foster family convention about the importance of adopting teenagers at a critical point in their lives.Seeds of changeJunior Boley, a graduate of the Mayhew Program, echoes Ashley’s gratitude for a bright and independent future, with opportunities he never imagined seizing. Boley, 18 and a freshman at Plymouth State College, majoring in marketing and sales, plans to work for Tom James, a high-end clothing company in Boston, when he graduates.

Boley grew up in a fragmented, low-income family in central New Hampshire. At age 9, he got into fights, faced suspension, and didn’t pay attention in the classroom.“I was a troubled kid without a focus. I just wanted to mess around,” he says. At age 10, after his first summer at Mayhew’s camp for at-risk boys on an island in Newfound Lake, mentors followed up with year-round counseling until he returned the next summer “with goals and the drive to be a better person.”The camp’s counselors were ”great people,” he said. His year-round mentor, Grayson Richey, changed his life forever.“He helped me with things my mom couldn’t help me with. He was the father figure I never really had. He expected a lot from me and I expected a lot from myself in return,” said Boley. “I wanted to do better for myself and challenge myself.”As a young man in Mayhew’s extension program, its final phase, Boley talks to kids in the neighborhood where he grew up. For the past three summers he’s worked as an assistant cook at Camp Mayhew. “The kids ask me questions because they know I was in their position,” Boley says proudly.Currently, Bristol-based Mayhew serves 84 eligible low-income boys in tuition-free summer camp, and follows 237 thoughout the school year, culminating in help with college applications and finding a job. Program candidates are referred by teachers, guidance counselors, and social services, and selected based on income, family dynamics, and a need for structure and change.The Plymouth-based Circle Program for girls operates in a similar manner, pairing school-age girls from low-income families with mentors who meet them for activities throughout the year, providing an immersive and esteem-building foundation that kicks off with summer camp.“It’s a transformative experience and an intensive experience,” said Jim Nute, executive director of the Mayhew Program, which is funded by grants and private donations from New Hampshire residents and businesses and The United Way. “We’re striving to be a stepping stone to a productive adulthood, awakening the boys to the incredible people they are.”Beauregard at FIT-New Horizons is optimistic about the potential for change in New Hampshire. Gov. Chris Sununu is looking at doing more for the state’s Division of Children, Youth, and Families through increased funding, she said.“I’m very hopeful about the future. We absolutely can get this done. If we really want to right this, we need to invest starting young.”"
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,"For NH to win big on sports book, we may have to root against the Patriots","Apr 6, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/politics/state/for-nh-to-win-big-on-sports-book-we-may/article_36520f52-1b84-54a4-b45d-d4f5af526ca1.html,"New Hampshire legislators are poised to approve legal sports betting this year, creating an interesting conundrum for sports fans.New England’s four main professional teams — the New England Patriots, Boston Red Sox, Boston Bruins and Boston Celtics — have won a combined 12 championships since 2001 and racked up impressive winning records and deep playoff runs in many of the seasons in which they didn’t win it all. But that success bodes ill for sports betting revenue.As recent figures out of Rhode Island’s casinos indicate, the better a hometown team does, the less money local bookies, and therefore states, take in.Gamblers in Rhode Island placed $20.7 million in wagers in February, much of it on the Patriots to win Super Bowl LIII. By the end of the month, after Tom Brady and Co. came out victorious, the state’s two casinos had to pay out $21.6 million.Under Rhode Island’s new sports betting law, the state gets 51 percent of the revenues — when there are some.“Most people in our market were betting for the Patriots,” said Paul Grimaldi, a spokesman for the Rhode Island Department of Revenue. “Your winning technically hurts your state. If you’re a Rhode Islander and you’re making a big bet (on the Patriots) that pays off, you’ve won and you’ve hurt all your neighbors.”Rhode Island’s betting revenue for March is up, thanks to the NCAA basketball tournaments, but experts say the New England region has to be cognizant that its teams’ successes will likely lead to volatility.A bill that would legalize sports betting in New Hampshire, both at physical bookmakers and online, passed the New Hampshire House 269-82 last month and is considered likely to pass the Senate. HB 480 would generate between $1.5 million and $7.5 million in its first full fiscal year of operation, according to a state analysis.Gov. Chris Sununu’s proposed budget for the upcoming biennium includes $10 million in revenue from sports betting.“If you want to approve gambling, that’s fine. You can get some revenue and maybe it will help you pay for a program you didn’t have, but this cannot be what you’re thinking about when you’re thinking about your state’s budget because it’s so small,” said Richard Auxier, a researcher at the Urban Institute who studies gambling and tax policy.He said the recent figures from Rhode Island show how little money may actually come into states and also suggest that bookmakers in New England must learn to strike a careful balance between setting odds on local teams that will turn a profit but not be so outside the mainstream that gamblers travel to other states.“This is one of the issues that legal sports betting has. Any time a New England team goes deep in the playoffs, your state revenue can get hit pretty badly,” said David Schwartz, an associate vice provost at the University of Nevada Las Vegas who previously served as the director of the school’s Center for Gaming Research.“Going back a long way, this is why they have something called layoff betting, where if you’re a bookie and you get a lot of action on one team you would call a bookie in another state and make a bet to offset that,” he said, adding that the practice is generally illegal and therefore not an option for licensed bookmakers.Companies that operate in multiple states, like William Hill, which runs Rhode Island’s books, are more immune to the volatility of one region’s success or failure, Schwartz said.For state gambling regulators and money-counters, though, the only hope may be rooting for very specific outcomes.In Rhode Island’s casinos, the spread for the Super Bowl had the Patriots favored by 2½ points, according to Grimaldi.“The senior team here, including the lottery director, were rooting for the Patriots to win by two,” he said."

Investment in infrastructure benefits everyone in the state, no matter the location, because it helps businesses, tourism, access, provision of services.Lastly, these are surplus funds we’re talking about. Once it’s gone, it’s gone. The best way to help property taxpayers is to fund individual projects that would otherwise require cutting school funding or raising their property taxes to accomplish.

She is joined in her call for fairness by feminist tennis legend Martina Navratilova, former gymnast Gabby Logan and ex-Olympic swimmer Sharron Davies.While the world begins to wake up to consequences of gender ideology, New Hampshire wades deeper into the mire with SB 263, which would allow gender dysphoric students to sue their schools for refusing to pretend they’re members of the opposite sex.

The pair are to be arraigned in Grafton County Superior Court on robbery charges.About 6:19 a.m. Thursday morning, the homeowner contacted state police and reported that a man and woman in ski masks and brandishing a handgun had invaded their home and made off with an undetermined amount of cash.The pair fled on foot, according to state police, who said they learned a short time later there had been a car crash on Lynn Avenue.A local resident checked on the car involved, a 2001 Lexus IS300, and found that the occupants had abandoned it.Troopers tracked the robbers from that accident scene and a K-9 led them to a nearby empty building.













State and local police searched an unoccupied building for several hours Thursday morning before arresting one of two charged with robbing a nearby homeowner in Alexandria.

As Evans tried to leave the building and escape, the K-9 bit her, officials said. Evans was taken into custody and treated for the dog bite.A state police SWAT team and the K-9 were called in to search the building and after a few hours Gedney was found hiding in the rafters, officials said.Out on bailJust last month Goffstown police officials said they were frustrated that Gedney, a repeat offender, had been released after a skirmish with multiple officers in that community.Gedney had been charged with resisting arrest and prowling after being seen acting suspicious near a closed business in the Central Park Plaza area at 675 Mast Road.After his arrest, Gedney was released on no bail even though he had several outstanding misdemeanor and felony warrants in multiple towns. Despite those warrants, a bail commissioner set a bail amount of zero with a court date on the Goffstown charges of Thursday in 9th Circuit District Court, Goffstown.Last month, Goffstown Police Chief Rob Browne had harsh words for the law that led to Gedney’s release, calling the decision to free someone with so many outstanding warrants “a head scratcher.”“What’s next for him?” asked Browne. “Does he use other means of escape or resisting at a later time where other officers from our jurisdiction or another jurisdiction have to deal with him? Where is the level of potential interaction becomes escalated to a point where somebody does get hurt?”At the time, Browne said he hoped Gedney’s release didn’t come back to haunt law enforcement.“I do hope that this gets changed and this does get the attention that it needs before somebody gets hurt by somebody that should have been kept in jail that wasn’t kept in jail,” Browne said. “And I hope that Mr. Gedney does not prove to be the solidifying piece of proof that something needs to change.”Lawmakers from both political parties and Gov. Chris Sununu have called for revisions to the 2018 bail reform law that requires judges to consider someone’s financial means when setting bail. The law also prohibits the pretrial detention of people simply because they can’t afford bail.The State Senate passed with bipartisan support some changes to that law but Sununu has yet to commit to precise changes adding he wants to prevent any “unforeseen consequences.” The bill to change the bail reform law is now pending before the House of Representatives.In a statement Friday, the ACLU of New Hampshire — which backed bail reform — put the responsibility of vetting individuals seeking bail on county and state prosecutors.“When we passed comprehensive bail reform last year, it ensured that people with limited income and presumed innocent don’t sit in jail before their trial just because they don’t have the money to pay bail,"" wrote Ariana Schechter, communications director for ACLU-NH.   ""At the same time, bail reform advanced public safety by enabling prosecutors to detain anyone pre-trial without bail by proving that they are dangerous. It’s on prosecutors to make that case, if they choose to.”"
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,NH biomass plants to close as challenge to law continues,"Apr 4, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/business/energy/nh-biomass-plants-to-close-as-challenge-to-law-continues/article_a08a7002-bb9a-5b4d-96fd-1b4220281685.html,"WHITEFIELD — Citing the failure of Eversource to come to terms on a new power-purchase agreement with six of New Hampshire’s biomass energy producers, four producers are suspending fuel purchases and operation.Douglas York, manager of the DG Whitefield biomass plant in Whitefield, said his facility would cease operations as of today, adding that a sister plant in Springfield would do so on April 13.Meanwhile, Hunter Carbee, the wood-energy representative for the NH Timber Harvesting Council, said both the Pinetree-Bethlehem and Pinetree-Tamworth plants stopped buying biomass on March 29.He added that the Bridgewater Power Co. is “limping along” but both Burgess Biopower in Berlin and Granite Shore Power's Schiller Station in Portsmouth, which Eversource divested in 2018, remain open.Under Senate Bill 365, which became law last year over a veto by Gov. Chris Sununu, Eversource and other utilities were required to buy electricity from six NH biomass plants and one trash-to-energy plant at above-market rates for three years.Last November, however, a group called the New England Ratepayers Association filed a petition with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission alleging that the state exceeded its constitutional authority by acting on a matter of interstate commerce.In January, the NH Public Utilities Commission said it cannot act on an agreement between the six biomass plants and Eversource, because the sides have not reached an agreement.Eversource Spokesman William Hinkle on Thursday in an e-mail said that despite a backdrop of “confusion and uncertainty, we continued working to implement the goals of the New Hampshire legislature while also ensuring that customers are protected if the law is invalidated by federal authorities.”He pointed out that the PUC “did not guarantee that the above-market costs could be recovered by Eversource if SB 365 were found unconstitutional, and instead suggested that the plants and Eversource voluntarily develop a customer-protection mechanism until the constitutionality questions are resolved.”He said $75 million in above-market costs is at stake for ratepayers.Eversource has proposed that the above-market costs “be placed in an escrow account until the constitutional questions around the law are resolved,” said Hinkle, “but the wood-generating plants have repeatedly rejected this prudent approach.”York said the decision to suspend operations in Whitefield was mainly due to the lack of a contract with Eversource. He said he will try to keep the Whitefield plant’s 21 full-time and one part-time employees on for the short-term, hopefully until a solution can be found to the current impasse.The Whitefield plant works with three dozen biomass producers, York said, most from New Hampshire.According to research conducted by the Timberland Owners’ Association and Plymouth State University, the biomass industry is worth $254 million a year to the state, said Carbee.“We’re talking thousands of jobs by the time you reach out to everyone who is impacted,” he said. “People are going to lose jobs.”New Hampshire’s biomass producers deliver some 800 tractor-trailer loads a week to energy plants, said Carbee, and while the good news is that there are paper companies in Maine that will take some of that product, “they cannot handle it all.”"

It was then referred to the Ways and Means Committee, which made significant changes to the taxation provisions.The committee amendment removed the original bill’s proposal for a fixed excise tax at the wholesale level of $30 per ounce. Instead, the Ways and Means Committee proposed a 5-percent tax on wholesale transactions and a 9-percent tax on retail sales at cannabis stores.Opponents of the bill, like Rep. Fred Doucette, R-Salem, called that a sales tax, and urged every representative who vowed to opposed a broad-based tax to vote against the measure.Rep. Richard Ames, D-Jaffrey, described the levy on retail marijuana sales as an extension of existing taxes on alcohol, tobacco, rooms and meals.“Cannabis prohibition has fostered an illegal and profoundly harmful black market, and this bill as amended will bring cannabis out of the shadows and provide for its appropriate taxation, regulation and legal use by adults,” said Ames. “And will provide additional support for substance abuse treatment and research.”Rep. Patrick Abrami, R-Stratham, chaired the commission that studied the issue throughout 2018. Its members were split on the question of legalization and made no recommendation.Abrami says the taxation scheme proposed in the Ways and Means amendment goes against the commission’s call for tax rates that raise only enough money for regulation and addiction prevention or treatment.“The commission said, ‘Don’t do this for the money,’” said Abrami. “Don’t pad the general fund with marijuana money.”Opponents of the bill warned that legalization has not resulted in the demise of the black market in states that have taken that step, nor have the actual revenues collected from taxation matched predictions.“In a perfect world the state could legalize marijuana for adults 21 or older, eliminate the black market and raise a new source of revenue. But guess what? We don’t live in a perfect world,” said Rep. Charles Burns, R-Milford. “What kind of message are we sending to kids with a huge opioid crisis on one hand and raising money by selling drugs on the other?”Supporters of legalization were hoping to get the House vote closer to the two-thirds majority needed to override a guaranteed veto by Gov. Chris Sununu, but instead lost ground.If the bill becomes law, the legal possession limit would be one ounce in plant form, five grams of hashish or six cannabis plants, and consumption would be prohibited by anyone in a moving vehicle or public place.A cannabis control commission will be required to start processing applications for retail locations by September 2020, and issue decisions within 90 days. That means the earliest pot shops could open would be January 2021.Cities and towns would be authorized to enact ordinances prohibiting or restricting the number of cannabis operations, while controlling the location, size and hours of operation.dsolomon@unionleader.com"

Exceptions would include anyone picking up or dropping off a student, provided the firearms remain in a motor vehicle.The first House vote in February followed a review by the Education Committee, after which the bill was sent to the Criminal Justice Committee.“The Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee strongly feels this bill is in the best interests of students and teachers of our state. It is our considered opinion that firearms do not belong on school or school property unless carried by personnel authorized by school administration,” said Rep. Sandy Swinburne, D-Marlborough.Rep. Mel Meyler, D-Contoocook, said New Hampshire is one of only three state that does not have a similar school safety statute.School boards would have the option of authorizing exemptions under certain circumstances, and the law would not apply to law enforcement, resource officers or members of the military when on duty.School districts in several New Hampshire communities have tried to impose gun-free zones, but a state law giving the state Legislature sole authority on all gun-related issues rendered those local decisions moot, according to the Attorney General.The review by the Criminal Justice Committee focused on the penalties in the bill, which Rep. Daryl Abbas, R-Salem, said would create a new class of criminals.“This bill is creating a crime, but not doing anything to prevent a crime from happening,” he said.Violators can be cited for a Class A misdemeanor and could face fines of up to $2,000 and a year in jail.“Its intention is to keep children safe, but the law would apply when the school is not in session. Anyone on school property for any event held by the town even when school is not in session could be prosecuted under this statute,” he said. “We will be prosecuting individuals with no criminal intent who are law-abiding citizens.”The bill did not pass by the two-thirds majority that will be required to override an anticipated veto by Gov. Chris Sununu, should it also pass the Senate.Vulnerable adultsA bill to establish a procedure to protect older citizens and other vulnerable adults from exploitation and abuse passed 219-156, with opposition from GOP members over potential confiscation of firearms by court order.They argued it did not provide enough due process protections for accused abusers.The main focus of bill, which now moves to the Senate, is financial exploitation of the elderly.Other House billsHB 641, which gives municipalities the option of implementing a hotel or room rental occupancy fee of up to $2 per day per room, passed 209-146, and now goes to the Senate.Supporters of the bill say it’s designed to help cities and towns make up for the legislature’s continued reduction in their share of the statewide rooms and meals tax.A bill to allow a special officiant license for anyone to solemnize a marriage in New Hampshire, HB 295, passed 214-155, with only three GOP votes.HB 729, a bill to create a right-to-know ombudsman and commission, failed 203-165, after Finance Committee review.Opponents argued that the $48,000 in the bill is inadequate to fund the operation. The bill passed 177-165 in February after Judiciary Committee review, but the Finance Committee recommended killing it.dsolomon@unionleader.com"

Chris Sununu has proposed with Vermont Gov. Phil Scott.At last weekend’s Granite State Taxpayer’s Rally in front of the State House it was Sununu’s turn.During his remarks Sununu spoke about a protest for the paid leave bill that recently had taken place outside the governor’s office.“Here’s the funny part. They bring all these people…about a week ago a group of young people, probably about 30 of them, most of them paid volunteers of the Democratic Party all came to my office to give me a pen to sign SB 1 the income tax,” Sununu said.Later the governor added, “Half of them are probably paid staff, I don’t think there is a lot of passion there.”In response Karen Hicks, a Democratic activist and cancer survivor, took to Twitter to attack Sununu.“#whatssofunny about taking time off for cancer treatment @govchrissununu? 74 trips to Boston for chemotherapy. Not funny. #paidleavenow #nhpolitics,” Hicks tweeted.The New Hampshire Republican State Committee answered Hicks on Monday night.“#whatsofunny is that @karenhicks is a paid lobbyist for SB1, which means she’s being paid to promote an income tax,” @NHGOP tweeted.“Meanwhile, @govchrissununu & @govphilscott pfml plan will cover every family and individual that needs access without a boondoggle income tax disaster #nhpolitics.”Later that night @NHGOP deleted its tweet but Democratic Party Chairman Raymond Buckley was having none of it.“As the leader of the N.H. Republican Party, Governor Chris Sununu needs to immediately apologize to cancer survivor Karen Hicks for having his party mocking her experience,” Buckley said.Sununu’s spokesman Benjamin Vihstadt said critics misunderstood the humor he was referring to.“The “funny story” Governor Sununu was referring to was the fact that the activists dropped off red pens at our office in support of SB1. As you know, red pens are usually reserved for vetoes,” Vihstadt said in a statement.“Governor Sununu remains committed to passing a truly voluntary paid family medical leave plan that does not require an income tax.The NH GOP did not respond to a request for comment.Hicks is a registered lobbyist and her only client in 2019 is the Campaign for a Family Friendly Economy.The campaign endorsed the paid leave effort last year and this year.Obamacare repeal off table, drug prices front and centerEarlier this week President Trump agreed to back off on his drive to repeal Obamacare until after the 2020 election.But we saw renewed evidence here in New Hampshire this week that soaring prescription drug prices will remain a central theme.The latest illustration came from a health care industry network that started a seven-figure advertising buy in 20 key states including nearly $100,000 on advertising in New Hampshire according to a spokesman.The Campaign for Sustainable Rx Pricing (CSRxP) is opposed to a Trump administration rule on drug rebates that it depicts as a “Big Pharma Bailout.”These groups maintain that getting rid of prescription drug rebates will raise premiums for seniors and the disabled by 25 percent and only line the pockets of drug makers.Among those groups financing this campaign are health insurers like Anthem and Blue Cross to CVS Pharmacy and the Federation of American Hospitals and other medical providers.The campaign’s spokesman said there is no set time frame for how long these ads will run but vow to keep the pressure on until the Trump administration rule is withdrawn.Meanwhile, the President’s daughter-in-law, Lara Lea Trump, said in Nashua Tuesday night that thanks to Trump prescription drug prices are the “lowest they’ve been in 40 years.”On a related topic, the U.S. Senate on Tuesday unanimously approved a federal Medicaid reform bill that would give federal regulators more power to go after drug makers that designate medication as a generic so they pay less to the government in rebates and cheat taxpayers.Sen. Maggie Hassan, D-NH, co-sponsored that rebate provision.The House passed the same bill last month and it now goes to Trump’s desk.(For more Granite Status, go to www.unionleader.com.)klandrigan@unionleader.comShaheen praises Trump on TurkeyIt’s not every day that Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-NH, gives a qualified thumbs up to President Trump on foreign policy.This presidential action Shaheen and a bipartisan group of senators have been pressing for is to halt the planned delivery of F-35 aircraft equipment to Turkey.Shaheen was on point of a Senate resolution to prevent Turkey from getting the U.S. fighter equipment unless the U.S. could confirm that Turkey would not get delivery of a Russian military defense system.She vowed to keep pushing.“I’m glad the administration is heeding the bipartisan call in Congress to delay the transfer of F-35 equipment to Turkey to help ensure U.S. military technology and capabilities cannot fall into the hands of the Kremlin. Though Turkey is an important U.S. ally, their close relationship with Putin and persistent efforts to acquire the Russian S-400 air defense system could seriously compromise our national security,” Shaheen said.“This is an important step forward, but doesn’t go far enough — I’ll continue to call on the administration to prevent the delivery of the F-35 aircraft until Turkey abandons its plans to obtain the Russian defense system.”Sununu pushing 2020 state political prioritiesThe two-term Republican chief executive Sununu hasn’t ruled out challenging Shaheen’s bid for re-election in 2020.But at Tuesday night’s fundraiser for the New Hampshire Republican State Committee, Sununu’s mind was all about achieving state election victories next year in New Hampshire.Sununu stressed opposing the agenda of Democratic legislative leaders alone will not win and the state GOP must present a positive vision that voters can embrace next year.‘We talk a lot about the extremism out there. They want to create loopholes on the voter laws they want to overturn the Second Amendment, they want to create an income tax, it seems there is no limit to what they want to do but if you think we are going to win by saying they’re socialists and we’re not, that’s not enough,” Sununu said.“It’s not about them being socialists; it is about us being for New Hampshire and that is a winning message in 2020.”Sununu also was frank about the party’s need to improve its candidate recruitment if it’s to reverse last November’s defeats and take back the Legislature. He noted the GOP lost 35 NH House seats by 120 votes or less.“This is all about the state House and the state Senate. Those are our seats; we didn’t earn them. We took them for granted,” Sununu said.“We had candidates waiting until September or October to knock on doors. This race started two months ago. You guys stick with us; we’ll stick with you.”Outside this GOP fundraiser, a group of NH Democratic activists held mock signs that depicted how much cash Sununu and family members received from the governor’s 2017 inaugural fund.Meanwhile, his father, former Gov. John H. Sununu tried to impress how important it was for every House and Senate GOP member to support Sununu’s vetoes that are bound to come during the next few months.“He is standing between us and disaster in this state,” the elder Sununu said of his son.“It is not the issue. It is standing firm as Republicans so that we can create power and sustaining that veto so we can get that legislation right. Even if you are uncomfortable sustaining that veto is critical.”Steady stream of 2020 Dems returnU.S. Sen.

CONCORD — House budget writers have completed work on a two-year state budget that’s at odds with the plan submitted by Gov. Chris Sununu in several key areas, including education funding.The House budget includes a new capital gains tax, designed to raise $150 million to help property-poor school districts. Sununu has pledged to veto any new taxes or fees.“What you’re going to see in our budget is a first step toward helping schools and our towns have better funding for public education,” says Rep. Mary Jane Wallner, D-Concord, chair of the House Finance Committee.The committee voted along party lines on Wednesday, 13-9, to send the budget to the full House for a vote on April 11.The governor has focused his fire on the committee’s decision to remove his plans for a $26 million secure, psychiatric hospital from the budget, but there are many other areas in which the Democratic House and Republican governor part ways.Education funding is at the top of that list. The budget on its way to the House restores grants designed to mitigate the impact of declining enrollment, provides more stable funding for full-day kindergarten and favors communities with low property values.Stabilization grantsThe House plan incorporates HB 177, legislation designed to stop the phase-out of so-called stabilization grants, intended to help school district by keeping state aid per student stable, even as enrollment declines.It calls for the stabilization grants to continue at the 2016 levels. Under current law, the grants are being reduced by 4 percent annually.The House budget proposal also includes full-day kindergarten students as part of regular state education funding, rather than the current reliance on revenue from Keno. Money from Keno would go into the Education Trust Fund, for overall education funding not tied to kindergarten.The new capital gains tax would be levied on the profits from the sale of assets like stocks, bonds or real estate (not including primary residence). It would raise an estimated $150 million a year that House budget writers would like to see used to help property-poor school districts.“When you look at a district like Berlin, they’ve been losing their stabilization money, in a community where 69 percent of the property is non-taxable. That puts the burden on 40 percent. We need to give these districts some relief,” said Rep. Patricia Lovejoy, D-Stratham.The House budget keeps the existing school funding formula in place, so that every school district gets its base adequacy grant, but targets additional aid to property poor districts and those with high numbers of students on free and reduced lunch.Winners, losersAccording to the House plan, Manchester could see $20 million in additional state aid over the two years, 2020-21, compared to what it would get under existing law. Berlin could see an additional $4.3 million and Claremont an additional $5.3 million, based on estimates provided by House staff.“We’ll be following the existing funding formula, but we’ll be targeting designated communities for additional aid,” said Lovejoy. “The existing formula does not account for disparities in property values among towns in the state.”Communities with high property values would lose some funding under the House plan, including school districts like Hampton ($89,000); Hanover ($76,000); and Rye ($56,000).The proposed House budget also eliminates reductions in business taxes that were scheduled to take effect in 2019 and 2020, and includes a universal paid family leave program funded through payroll deductions of 0.5 percent.“From an income tax masquerading as paid family leave program to a job-killing capital gains tax and raising taxes on New Hampshire’s employers, the Democratic leadership of the House Finance Committee has put New Hampshire’s hardworking taxpayers on the hook for $300 million in additional spending,” said Sununu.Senate Republican leader Chuck Morse, R-Salem, warned that a budget like the one headed to the House is likely to face a gubernatorial veto.“If House budget writers are serious about passing a budget for the governor to sign they would not include tax increases,” he said.The Finance Committee will hold a briefing on the proposed budget in Representatives Hall on Tuesday from 10 to 11:30 a.m.dsolomon@unionleader.com"
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,"House facing final votes on legal pot, gun-free school zones","Apr 3, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/politics/state/house-facing-final-votes-on-legal-pot-gun-free-school/article_1d0797c8-a4cc-525e-887f-a75f42b5252b.html,"CONCORD — The House is scheduled to vote for the second time on legal marijuana and gun-free school zones on Thursday, the final day for reps to act on House bills other than budget-related legislation.Also on the agenda, protective orders for vulnerable adults and a bill that would allow cities and towns to impose a hotel or room occupancy fee of up to $2 per day per room with all the revenue to stay local.The bill to legalize the recreational use and commercial sale of marijuana in New Hampshire by adults, HB 481, passed its first test in the House of Representatives on Feb. 27, in a bipartisan 209-147 vote after review by the Criminal Justice Committee.It was then referred to the Ways and Means Committee, which made some significant changes to the taxation provisions.The amendment removes the original bill’s proposal for a fixed excise tax on wholesale transactions of $30 per ounce. Instead, the Ways and Means Committee proposes a 5-percent tax on wholesale transactions and a 9-percent tax on the retail sales at cannabis stores.“This method of taxation is similar to that used for our existing taxes on tobacco products and on meals and rentals,” according to Rep. Richard Ames, D-Jaffrey.The proposed cannabis tax rates, taken together with the other fees and fines established by the bill, will be below comparable rates in nearby states, according to Ames. The effective rate in Massachusetts, combining local and state taxes, ranges from 17 to 20 percent.Rep. Patrick Abrami, R-Stratham, chaired the Commission to Study the Legalization, Regulation, and Taxation of Marijuana, which examined the issue throughout 2018. The commission membership was split on the question of legalization and made no recommendation.Abrami says the taxation scheme proposed in the Ways and Means amendment goes against the commission’s call for tax rates that raise only enough money for regulation and addiction prevention or treatment.“The reason this is a problem is that the legislature will quickly become addicted to this revenue, making it difficult for the program to be terminated if future metrics show that the many warnings of the negative effects to society, as discussed in the policy debate, come true,” according to Abrami, an opponent of legalization. “Once this program begins, there will be no turning back.”Supporters of legalization will be hoping to get the House vote closer to the two-thirds majority needed to override an anticipated veto by Gov. Chris Sununu.The bill will then move to the Senate, where state Sen. Bob Giuda, R-Warren, says legalization opponents are prepared to mount strong opposition.Democrats hold the majority in both House and Senate, with legalizing marijuana a key plank in the party platform.Gun-free school zonesA bill to declare gun-free zones on school property across the state is on its way to the House for a second time, after passing 194-154 on Feb. 2, without a single Republican vote.The first vote followed a review by the Education Committee, after which the bill was sent to the Criminal Justice Committee. It cleared that committee in a 10-8 party-line vote last Wednesday.The bill, HB 564, bans possession of firearms on school property, including buildings, grounds, school buses and vans. Exceptions would include anyone picking up or dropping off a student, provided the firearms remain in a motor vehicle.This is another bill that Sununu has promised to veto, and it has not passed by veto-proof numbers.Vulnerable adultsThis bill, HB 696, establishes a procedure to protect older citizens and other vulnerable adults from financial exploitation or physical abuse.“The bill is important and necessary because our criminal statutes do not provide adequate protection for our state’s most vulnerable citizens; too often, by the time abuse, neglect, or exploitation can be proven, assets are long gone or the vulnerable adult has been subjected to unsafe conditions for far too long,” said chief sponsor Rep. Renny Cushing, D-Hampton.The bill initially came out of the Health, Human Services and Elderly Affairs Committee with a 22-0 endorsement, and was referred to the Criminal Justice Committee after a bipartisan 208-132 House vote on Feb. 27.The Criminal Justice Committee, however, was divided along party lines in a 12-8 vote, with Republican opponents expressing concerns over provisions that allow for the confiscation of firearms.“The bill allows for the seizing of firearms without the defendant even being aware of the accusations that have been made,” says opponent Rep. John Burt, R-Goffstown.Local room rental taxThis bill, HB 641, gives municipalities the option of implementing a hotel or room rental occupancy fee of up to $2 per day per room, with the money going into in a capital reserve fund, tourism support fund, revolving fund, or other special revenue fund designed to offset the cost of municipal services associated with tourism.Supporters of the bill say it’s designed to help cities and towns make up for the legislature’s continued reduction in their share of the statewide rooms and meals tax.Opponents warn that allowing municipalities to impose their own taxes or fees puts the state on a slippery slope.“Hotels generate significant property taxes and spur other economic activity without adding significantly to the local education costs. The minority believes these funds are adequate to support the level of services required to handle this increase in local activity,” according to Rep. Charles Burns, R-Milford.dsolomon@unionleader.com"
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,Jennifer Horn: New Hampshire's mental health crisis cannot wait,"Apr 3, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/opinion/columnists/jennifer-horn-new-hampshire-s-mental-health-crisis-cannot-wait/article_6bd904ee-8c07-5466-a886-d6dcde0ce280.html,"For over 20 years New Hampshire has faced a growing mental health crisis. Suicide rates are climbing, emergency room waits for mental health patients are getting longer and longer, children with mental health issues are being treated in the same facilities as adults and, perhaps worst of all, Granite Staters with severe mental health issues are being housed in a prison ward.According to the most recent reports, a New Hampshire citizen who goes to an emergency room with critical mental health concerns can expect to join as few as 30 or as many as 70 other patients waiting for a mental health bed somewhere in the state on any given day.











Imagine being the parent of a suicidal 15 year-old, or a veteran with PTSD who feels like she can’t make it through another hour, or the father of two young children who is afraid he is about to hurt himself and others. Imagine the emotional torment that sends these people to an emergency room where they hope to get the life-saving care they know they need and instead they are told … to wait.And wait.And wait.Because in New Hampshire, just when they need it the very most, there is nowhere to go.Or, perhaps worse, imagine being a parent or spouse who goes through the trauma of having your loved one civilly committed for mental health care because you know they are potentially a threat to themselves or others and instead of being sent to a hospital they are instead essentially incarcerated at the Secure Psychiatric Unit of the state prison where they are housed with actual dangerous criminals.There is little in life more tragic than a society that does not address the needs of the most vulnerable among us.In New Hampshire, our neighbors who suffer with mental illnesses are not receiving the care they so desperately need, but it does not have to be that way.Gov. Chris Sununu has offered a mental health care plan for New Hampshire that would address the most critical needs of our mental health system. It is a plan that was enthusiastically supported by Democrats and Republicans alike when he announced it earlier this year, and, after two decades of legislators debating, manipulating and ignoring the problem, it is a plan that is long overdue.It is a smart proposal that rests on the cornerstone of building a new, 60-bed forensic hospital that would serve those individuals who are currently being treated like prisoners rather than like patients at the SPU.The plan also calls for the youngest patients at New Hampshire Hospital to be moved into a child-focused care environment where they can receive support with other young people in a socially and medically appropriate facility.By creating the most medically appropriate care environments for those populations, the mental health beds at New Hampshire Hospital would be made available for those patients who are waiting … waiting … waiting in emergency rooms.Make no mistake, this is a case of life and death for many. Suicide rates in NH continue to rise and, tragically, suicide remains the 2nd-highest cause of death among 15– to 24-year-olds in our state.Veterans, victims of rape and sexual assault and young LGBT people all remain at increased risk as well.But now the Democrats in the State House are trying to put the brakes on the forensic hospital that is the cornerstone of this plan.They see a political opportunity here to damage the governor by manipulating the process. Allowing this smart plan to pass would, in their minds, give a popular Republican governor too big a political win.So they say that 20 years of debate is not enough. They engage in petty, damaging political games that ignore the real needs of real people who are suffering in our state.Instead of doing the right thing, when it comes to helping the most vulnerable among us, instead of making sure that every patient in New Hampshire who comes looking for mental health care is helped, the Democrats in Concord are, in the most despicable fashion, telling them to wait.We cannot afford to wait any longer."

In more than 30 years, a Nashua official said at a forum, he has never seen such a collaborative, break-down-the-silos effort among various agencies and groups.In Concord, however, more effort seems to be dedicated to building political silos than in working toward solutions. When that threatens to upend a plan to, finally, end the prison-like housing of the severely mentally ill, it is more than a shame. It may well lead to more expensive lawsuits against the state.It was encouraging to see Gov. Chris Sununu include in his budget monies for a secure psychiatric unit that would be on state hospital grounds and away from the current state prison setting. This has been an issue for years. The state has, time and again, agreed to fix it but has failed to do so.The new unit would not be an end to the problem, of course. It is a component in a renewed effort to get people treatment in less-restrictive and less-costly settings. But the new unit would end, or at least greatly lessen, the current dangerous situation in which severely ill patients, who are a danger to themselves or others, find themselves waiting for days in hospital emergency rooms and then shipped to the state prison. (Story, Page A1.)From his reaction on Monday, Gov. Sununu was as stunned as others to learn that House Democrats have decided to scrap the $26 million plan for either a new building or a new wing on an existing state hospital structure. Having talked about the problem for years, the Democrats now want to “study” the problem. More study would put off a solution for at least three more years.Gov. Sununu was right to call this “unconscionable.’’ When he comes down from the ceiling, he should take the high road and simply repeat his case for the reasons and need for the unit where the mentally ill, and their families, are not treated like hardened criminals.We believe Granite Staters will appreciate the effort."

Chris Sununu chose the hospital on Tuesday to launch his counter-assault against House lawmakers and their plan to remove a $26 million secure psychiatric unit at New Hampshire Hospital from the governor’s proposed budget.The new 60-bed forensic unit would have to be planned by November 2019 and operational by June 2021, according to the budget proposal Sununu submitted in February.The new beds would accommodate patients with the most challenging mental health issues, including those now held at a secure psychiatric unit in the state prison, even though they’ve committed no crime.The combined effect of the new building and investments in community-based mental health services would open up enough rooms at New Hampshire Hospital to end the emergency room boarding and accommodate the growing demand for mental health services, Sununu said.Rare opportunity

Surrounded by supportive hospital officials, Republican lawmakers and commissioners from key state agencies, the governor on Tuesday urged the House and Senate to restore the funding. He cited the unusually large state budget surplus, fueled by a strong economy, as presenting a rare opportunity.“We have $200 million in surplus funds; you don’t find that every day,” he said.“That presents an opportunity for the state to not just talk about the issue, but make an impact. For 20 years we’ve been talking about designing a new secure psychiatric unit … I was appalled when I heard we might just kick that can down the road some more. We are here to advocate the need to move on this now, today.”State Rep. Sharon Nordgren, D-Hanover, who chairs the Finance Committee division dealing with Health and Human Services, said on Monday it’s unusual for such a large building project to proceed without architectural, engineering or staffing plans in place, using a school building project as an example.Sununu replied that extraordinary circumstances require an extraordinary response.“This is a crisis that has never hit this state before,” he said. “So yes, are we taking drastic measures? You bet we are. Are they the right measures? Undoubtedly.”

Different perspectiveSome community-based providers of mental health services are not so sure. They believe moving children and adults who no longer need to be at New Hampshire Hospital into community settings will open up all the space needed at the psychiatric facility to create a secure, forensic unit, without a $26 million construction project.The Disability Rights Center, which sued the state over the treatment of mental health patients, supports the House action.“We believe that building an unnecessary forensic hospital will divert precious funds and workforce from where they are most needed: community-based mental health services,” according to a DRC statement issued Tuesday.“Spending millions of dollars to significantly expand the state’s mental health institutional bed capacity undermines the state’s ability to invest in much-needed sustainable changes to the state’s community mental health system. The House Finance Committee is making the right decision to not move forward with the governor’s proposal to build a forensic hospital.”Finance Committee Chair Mary Jane Wallner, D-Concord, said the governor’s plan was unanimously voted down by members of both parties in the health and human services subcommittee, “because it was insufficient to address the mental health needs of our communities and proposed the construction of a building without any resources to staff or operate it.”“The governor should work with us on lowering the need for new admissions in the first place, which we can accomplish through funding for community health efforts,” she said.Focus on communityThat sentiment was echoed by Becky Whitley, policy director for the N.H. Children’s Behavioral Health Collaborative.“The collaborative undoubtedly shares the widespread concern about the large numbers of children, youth and adults waiting in hospital emergency departments for treatment,” she said.“However, the best approach is to focus on building evidence-based and cost-effective community-based services designed to reduce the need for inpatient hospitalization, which tends to erode the community and family connections.”State Rep. Renny Cushing, D-Hampton, has led the fight to move civilly committed patients out of the Secure Psychiatric Unit at the state prison for years.Earlier this year he filed a bill to fund and construct such a facility, but agreed to have that bill amended to a study committee when he learned that Sununu would propose the use of surplus funds to build the unit in his state budget address.“I’m disappointed that it’s not there in the budget that’s going to be recommended to the House, but I realize this is a long process,” said Cushing, “and I hope there’ll be a way to end the criminalization of people with mental illness.”dsolomon@unionleader.com“We have $200 million in surplus funds; you don’t find that every day,” he said. “That presents an opportunity for the state to not just talk about the issue, but make an impact.

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) served as its keynote speaker.“Pocohantas, I think she’s done unfortunately; it’s too bad to see,” Lara Trump said referring to Trump’s nickname for Warren.Stepanek claimed 500 bought tickets to attend Tuesday’s event and he expected to net at least $70,000 from it. “I’m not satisfied. The next event I’d like to have 1,000 come and net $150,000 from it,” Stepanek said.Major sponsors of this Spring to Victory celebration were Sununu, Senate Republican Leader Chuck Morse, former GOP state chairman Steve Duprey of Concord, several GOP committees and Peter Napoli, whose company owns many McDonald’s restaurants in New Hampshire.During an interview, Lara Trump said President Trump’s threat to close down the southern border with Mexico unless he gets more cooperation with America’s neighbors was not an idle one.“I think one thing the people know about Donald Trump is he is not a bluffer. When he says he’s going to do something he generally does it,” she said.“He has given Congress every opportunity to fix this and they have failed to do so.”Her visit comes a day after Republican congressional leaders confirmed they will not be acting on a replacement to the Affordable Care Act until after the 2020 election.“He tried to get something done quicker but unfortunately the Congress was not on board,” she said.A North Carolina native, Lara Trump declined to criticize former Vice President Joe Biden, who in recent days had two women come forward to say he touched them in ways that made them uncomfortable.“Having been in this family and since Day One had things written about us, talked about us, said about us that were untrue I can tell you I take everything with a grain of salt,” she said.These allegations from several years ago could have been politically timed to stop Biden’s candidacy before it was to become official later this month, she suggested.“It seems politically advantageous for his potential competitors to want to keep him out of this race. I don’t know why this is coming out now but I’m going to let them fight with each other,” Lara Trump said.Outside the event, the New Hampshire Democratic Party had protesters holding large signs depicting the cash that Sununu’s Inaugural Fund in 2017 and 2018 had reimbursed him and family members.“From self-dealing inaugural slush funds to an exclusive focus on corporate special interests over the needs of New Hampshire families, the similarities between Sununu and Trump are uncanny,” Democratic state chairman Raymond Buckley said in a statement.“So it makes perfect sense that Sununu would be fundraising with a Trump instead of standing up to the President as he works to take away the health care of tens of thousands of Granite Staters and steal hundreds of millions from our shipyard.”klandrigan@unionleader.comh"
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,Death penalty repeal clears Senate committee in 4-1 vote,"Apr 2, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/politics/state/death-penalty-repeal-clears-senate-committee-in---vote/article_a5f34fbf-1807-50f1-8297-7ca983b9dc48.html,"CONCORD — When the time came to vote on a bill to repeal the death penalty in New Hampshire, members of the Senate Judiciary Committee must have thought everything that can be said about capital punishment has been said in multiple public hearings over the past two years.There was little discussion and no debate on Tuesday as the committee voted 4-1 to send the repeal bill, HB 455, to the 24-member Senate with an “ought to pass” recommendation.Voting in favor were Sens. Martha Hennessey, D-Hanover; Melanie Levesque, D-Nashua; Shannon Chandley, D-Amherst; and Harold French, R-Franklin. Voting against was Republican Sen. Sharon Carson of Hudson.The bill passed the House on March 7 in a 279-88 roll call.Levesque alluded to the hours of testimony from death penalty opponents in both House and Senate hearings.“The thing that stuck with me is if you continue to have appeals, then it brings the (victim’s) loved ones through the whole thing over and over again,” she said, referring to the years of legal wrangling that follow a death sentence.French, who voted for repeal last year, said he was more convinced than ever after another round of public hearings this year.“Having listened to the testimony, my feelings are stronger than last time,” he said. “Although there are probably a handful of good reasons to keep the death penalty in place in the state, I think it’s overwhelmingly been proven there are more reasons to get rid of it.”One reason to keep the death penalty on the books, according to proponents, is to assure the execution of Michael Addison, now on death row for the 2006 murder of Manchester police officer Michael Briggs.Manchester’s three Democratic state senators have split on the issue in the past, with senators Lou D’Allesandro and Kevin Cavanaugh voting against repeal, while Senate President Donna Soucy has voted to end the death penalty.“The senators clearly heard the compelling testimony on the death penalty last week,” said Arnie Alpert, board member of the NH Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty, after the committee session. “We’re optimistic about the prospect of the bill passing when it comes to the full Senate.”Gov. Chris Sununu, saying he “stands with law enforcement,” promises to veto the repeal bill this year, just as he did last year.This year’s repeal bill, however, has already passed the House by a veto-proof margin, and appears to have the needed 16 votes in the Senate to override the anticipated veto.The bill goes to a floor vote in the Senate next Thursday.dsolomon@unionleader.com"
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,House budget draft nixes plan for $26M secure psychiatric hospital,"Apr 1, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/politics/state/house-budget-draft-nixes-plan-for-m-secure-psychiatric-hospital/article_e3b1ccff-1ead-53b1-a931-a560695fab8c.html,"CONCORD — House budget writers have zeroed out one of Gov. Chris Sununu’s most widely applauded initiatives — his plan for a new secure psychiatric unit to house some of the state’s most challenging mental health patients.The House Finance Committee will vote Wednesday on its version of the two-year revenue and spending plan, which is at odds with the governor’s plan on several fronts, including family medical leave, capital gains taxes, business taxes, education funding and mental health services.The recommended House budget, scheduled for a floor vote on April 11, strikes out $26 million for a new 60-bed forensic psychiatric hospital, which would have to be planned by November 2019 and operational by June 2021, according to the budget proposal Sununu submitted in February.The House is taking a more cautious approach, recommending funding for a study committee to oversee planning for such a facility, but with no groundbreaking anticipated until 2022, if at all.“We think it’s too soon to construct a new 60-bed forensic unit. We thought there has to be a lot more planning for that,” said Rep. Sharon Nordgren, who chairs the Finance Committee division dealing with Health and Human Services.“If you were at a school district meeting, you wouldn’t just give the district money to build a school. You’d want to know how it’s going to be staffed, who’s going to go there, how many teachers are you going to need? This budget will start that process, but not put all the money up front.”Sununu cited the new forensic hospital as one of the top priorities in his budget address. New Hampshire is one of only a handful of states that houses certain patients who pose a danger to themselves or others in a secure mental health unit at the state prison, even though they’ve committed no crime.“I put a team together to design a plan to ensure all populations were considered and no stone was left unturned,” Sununu said in his inaugural.He called the new secure psychiatric unit the linchpin in a $40 million package of mental health initiatives that also included funding for new community-based housing units for adults and children transitioning out of New Hampshire Hospital.Budgets at oddsThe House budget includes funding for the transitional housing to accommodate those leaving New Hampshire Hospital, both adults and children, but no money for a new building or wing.“We aren’t sure there needs to be a separate facility,” said Nordgren. “There may be space opening up at New Hampshire Hospital when the children move out, or we may need another building. That’s a discussion that needs to be had.”Sununu reacted angrily to the news that the budget coming from the legislature may be lacking one of his signature initiatives.“I am shocked that Democratic leadership went from applauding this initiative in my budget address to failing to fulfill New Hampshire’s obligations in the state’s 10 Year Mental Health Plan,” he said.“New Hampshire families have waited over 20 years for a solution and it is unconscionable that House Democratic leadership is now telling them that it is ‘too soon’ to move forward with this solution.”Sununu urged the Senate to reverse the House action before the budget lands on his desk at the end of the session in June.“The Senate Finance Committee must immediately restore this critical funding so that New Hampshire is no longer the only state in the nation that keeps involuntarily committed mental health patients inside a prison,” he said.Lori Shibinette, CEO of New Hampshire Hospital, favors the governor’s approach, but not all stakeholders agree.Alternative optionsMichael Skibbie, policy director for the Disability Rights Center, worries that the state will invest millions in brick and mortar when it should instead be boosting its Medicaid payment rates so that providers could rebuild the community-based services for which New Hampshire was once famous.Moving children and adults who no longer need to be at New Hampshire Hospital into community settings will open up all the space needed at the psychiatric facility to create a secure forensic unit, while also easing the backlog of mental health patients in hospital emergency rooms, according to Skibbie — without a $26 million construction project.Shibinette has testified that it is not feasible to operate a psychiatric hospital that includes a conventional patient population as well as a forensic population. That’s one dispute House budget writers believe needs to be resolved before ground is broken on a new wing or building.The House budget also includes a capital gains tax the governor doesn’t want, a family and medical leave plan that he opposes and a reversal of business tax cuts that he wants to see take effect.House budget writers removed most of Sununu’s one-time earmarks for municipal projects, opting instead to revive a revenue-sharing formula that hasn’t been used for more than a decade.Finance Committee Chairman Mary Ann Wallner of Concord says some compromise will be necessary between the House and Senate, and between the legislature and the governor, to get a budget signed into law by June 30.“Those are big areas in the budget, but there are lots of smaller areas that we might be able to negotiate with the governor on,” she said. “We want to leave those negotiations open and not preconceive what the final decision will be.”dsolomon@unionleader.com"
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,Letter: Lost their minds,"Mar 30, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/opinion/letters_to_editor/letter-lost-their-minds/article_1253bd6f-1f69-5e43-bfe6-10540a0ca766.html,"To the Editor: The Democrats in the New Hampshire Legislature seem to have lost their minds.The sheer number of bills with enormous price tags that have been passed by the legislature is staggering. As it stands, spending for the 2020-21 budget would grow by $319 million. In the 2022-23 budget, spending would grow by at least $246 million, based on known appropriations.New taxes, fees, and fines abound: a family leave insurance income tax, a canoe tax, raising business taxes that were slated to be reduced, the capital gains tax, a motor boat decal fee, increased fines for OHRV violations, and a new $2 hotel room fee (on top of the pre-existing 9 percent meals and rooms tax), to name a few.Gov. Chris Sununu put forth a $13 billion budget that included no new taxes or increased fees. The House Dems’ passed bills amount to a nearly 2.5 percent increase in the overall $13 billion budget from one biennium to the next. That’s a 2.5 percent increase in state government, another step in the steady march towards bigger and bigger government intrusion in our lives.Call your legislators in Concord and tell them to get themselves under control and that you know how to spend your own hard-earned money better than they do. Tell them to put a halt to the out-of-control taxes and spending spree at the Statehouse.LILLIE SANDERSONMilford"
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,"Your Turn, NH: Richard Gulla -- Sununu budget forgets those who make NH work","Mar 30, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/opinion/columnists/your-turn-nh-richard-gulla----sununu-budget/article_8f874f38-ffa6-5d41-97d2-595a192451cf.html,"ARGUABLY, one of the most important documents a governor can produce is his state budget, which is why union members at the State Employees’ Association, myself included, were left speechless when we pored over the details of Gov. Chris Sununu’s budget.If you expected Sununu’s budget to address the grim realities Granite Staters face, you will need to look elsewhere for that leadership. He forgot about a few key groups.As the governor likes to remind us, New Hampshire is experiencing an economic boom. Where is that reflected in his budget for staffing and retention across state agencies? You would be hard pressed to find it. Unfunded positions are now the norm.For example, the Department of Health and Human Services — the same agency that mandated their staff to work overtime during the federal government shutdown — received inadequate funding to address their staffing needs. His budget still leaves the Division for Children, Youth and Families short-staffed. The Department of Transportation, whose workers keep our roads safe and now maintain more road with the expansion of I-93, received nothing to address their staffing and retention issues. The list goes on.When economic indicators point to a roaring economy, it means that now is the time to make investments in the state’s workforce, both in staffing and wages. It is not enough to talk about a booming economy and expect that it will somehow sprinkle everyone with good fortune.The workforce needs to directly experience the effects of a strong economy. I cannot emphasize this enough: now is the time for investment. The economic pendulum will eventually swing in the other direction and whoever is sitting in the governor’s office will be quick to tell workers that times are lean. This justification will be used for just about everything.Current public employees are not the only ones who have been forgotten in Sununu’s budget. New Hampshire’s public servant retirees who have not received a true cost-of-living adjustment since 2010 were also left out as well.With the exception of a one-time payment made last year to retirees who fell within certain parameters, they have not seen an adjustment in eight years. This means their purchasing power has dropped by more than 15 percent when accounting for inflation. To add insult to injury, many have seen their health-care premiums skyrocket over the last decade. How can they possibly retire with dignity when they’ve been forgotten like this?Retirees are one of the most inclined groups to spend their pensions right here in the Granite State. If the governor had chosen to invest in retirees, he would be investing in the local economy. Yet he missed an opportunity to do so with his budget.The very people who make New Hampshire run smoothly or who have dedicated their lives to this state have been forgotten in this budget. Granite Staters need to demand that their legislators do the work the people elected them to do and rectify this wrong."

Incredibly, they are now collectively trying to foist blame upon Gov. Chris Sununu.The President repeatedly forewarned that, if he did not get the funding he wanted for the border wall, he would consider declaring a national emergency as a way to bypass congressional gridlock. Clearly it was not an idle threat, and it was Congress’ job to come up with a compromise solution.They didn’t.The consequences for their failure are now at hand: the President must secure the funds that he needs to secure our southern border by redirecting money away from Portsmouth Naval Shipyard projects.Governor Sununu has no say in where federal funds go. It’s nonsensical and disingenuous to point the finger at him when their own failings and blind partisanship put our state — and the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard — in this predicament.To the New Hampshire congressional delegation, I say: instead of disclaiming responsibility and playing a ridiculous game of pin-the-blame-on-the-governor, do your job.CONNOR O’KEEFENorth Hampton"
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,"Senate passes bills to create independent redistricting process, encourage student voting","Mar 28, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/politics/state/senate-passes-bills-to-create-independent-redistricting-process-encourage-student/article_eaf6c43a-e949-5a6a-b252-295213aea319.html,"CONCORD — In a series of party-line votes, the state Senate on Thursday passed several election-related bills, including one that would take the job of drawing electoral districts away from the Legislature, and another that would protect the right of college students to vote even if they decide not to register their cars in New Hampshire.The Democratically controlled Senate and House now agree on an independent commission to draw new electoral districts after the 2020 census. The House passed a similar bill on Feb. 28.Senators on Thursday approved SB 8, which would establish an independent commission to draw district lines for state representatives, state senators, executive councilors, U.S. senators and representatives.Democrats said the bill is designed to prevent gerrymandering, the drawing of political districts to benefit one party over another, and that it complies with a constitutional mandate that the legislature draw such lines by giving lawmakers the right to vote on the commission maps.Republicans said the legislature will not have the right to amend or reject the commission maps, and would be reduced to a “rubber stamp” for commission decisions, in violation of a clear constitutional mandate.The House and Senate bills will most likely be reconciled in a conference committee, with another round of voting in House and Senate, before landing on Gov. Chris Sununu’s desk, where a veto is expected.“By establishing an independent redistricting commission, we take the task of drawing district lines out of the hands of the very people most likely to benefit from the outcome,” said state Sen. Shannon Chandley, D-Amherst.Disputes over new district lines drawn by Republican majorities after the census of 2000 and 2010 led to appeals to the state Supreme Court.“We are rated nationally as having the fifth-worst gerrymandering in the country in this very, very small state,” said Portsmouth Democrat Martha Fuller Clark. “Let’s do away with that rating and show we can create fair and equitable methodology to put people into office.”Rep. Regina Birdsell, R-Hampstead, who led Republican efforts on election law in the last two sessions, argued against the bill.“I applaud the idea behind this but I’m not quite sure that it’s constitutional,” she said. “It’s the responsibility of the legislature in the constitution to draw the lines of the districts … This bill allows a redistricting plan to become law at some point, conceivably, without the approval of the legislature.”Carve-out for transientsVoting again 14-10, the Senate passed SB 67, which aims to undo much of what Republicans accomplished when they passed a bill last year regarding residency and domicile definitions for purposes of voting.The bill is modeled on legislation in Maine, Massachusetts and other states that require residency as a condition of voting, but exempt certain transient populations from having to register their motor vehicles or obtain a state driver’s license.“In a mobile society, students, medical personnel, interns, military, they pay rent or mortgages, buy groceries and support our local economies,” said Sen. Melanie Levesque, D-Nashua. “If they chose to vote in the state in which they temporarily reside, it is their right to do so without triggering motor vehicle related charges.”Several Republican senators took issue with that analysis, including Sen. Bob Giuda of Warren.“Our obligation is not to out-of-state students, it’s to the residents of this state,” he said. “Our job is to protect the sanctity of legitimate votes, not to ensure that anyone who sets foot in the state gets to cast a ballot. We need to stop talking about rights and incorporate the concept of responsibilities.”A bill to enable residents to register at the Department of Motor Vehicles when tending to other business (SB 7) also passed after a lengthy debate, 13-10.dsolomon@unionleader.com"
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,Changes to Medicaid work requirement clear Senate,"Mar 28, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/politics/state/changes-to-medicaid-work-requirement-clear-senate/article_7e4917f9-565b-53a6-8515-2dd27548447a.html,"CONCORD — A bill to change the terms of work and community service requirement in the state’s expanded Medicaid program has passed the state Senate and is on its way to the House.Thursday’s party-line, 14-10 vote comes the day after a federal judge blocked new work requirements on Medicaid recipients for a second time.U.S. District Court Judge James Boasberg on Wednesday rejected Medicaid work requirements in Arkansas and Kentucky, ruling they hurt Medicaid’s basic purpose of providing health coverage to low-income households.A similar legal challenge to New Hampshire’s work requirement has been filed in the same court by the National Health Law Program, New Hampshire Legal Assistance and the National Center for Law and Economic Justice on behalf low-income residents in the state.The fact that New Hampshire’s work requirement could be struck down on the same basis hung over Thursday’s debate. Democrats described their bill as a contingency plan should the work requirement cause thousands of people to lose coverage, as was the case in Arkansas.Republicans said they were willing to address that problem if and when it occurs, but for now there is no problem. They accused Democrats of a double-cross on the issue — agreeing to the work requirement to get expanded Medicaid passed, and then trying to negate that requirement once they obtained a legislative majority.“If the kind of problem that happened in Arkansas happens in New Hampshire, I’ll be among the first people to join with all 24 of us to fix whatever issue it is that is leading to inadvertent denial of benefits. None of us wants that,” said Republican Sen. Jeb Bradley of Wolfeboro, one of the key negotiators of the expanded Medicaid compromise.“What I don’t want to do is enable people who are unwilling to work to avoid the work and community engagement requirement.”Senate Bill 290 would, among other things, terminate the work requirement if it results in more than 500 people losing their government-funded health insurance.The Democratic-led House recently shelved its own bill to completely eliminate the work requirement to allow the debate to focus on the Senate bill.If the Senate bill passes the House, it is likely to face a veto from Republican Gov. Chris Sununu, who on Thursday issued a joint statement with Republican legislative leaders.“A ruling from one federal trial court judge in Washington, D.C., is only the first step in the process, and we are confident that the work requirements approved for New Hampshire and every other state will ultimately be upheld,” he said.“New Hampshire will move forward with implementation of our work requirement, and we will do everything we can to defend New Hampshire’s bi-partisan Medicaid program, including intervening in the lawsuit to assert our state’s interests.”The primary sponsor of the bill, Sen. Cindy Rosenwald, D-Nashua, said the lawsuits point to the need for New Hampshire to have an alternative in place.“We have recently seen what happens when work requirements go wrong,” she said. “Given these realities, it is disappointing that my Republican colleagues voted against these improvements today.”dsolomon@unionleader.com"
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,"For years Stephen Marshall would be released on bail, skip court and re-offend","Mar 28, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/crime/for-years-stephen-marshall-would-be-released-on-bail-skip/article_e7f456f5-1053-5ed1-b5d3-c6d3191e0cb9.html,"Before Stephen Marshall was killed Wednesday in a shootout with police at the Quality Inn in Manchester, he had a long history of life outside the law.The 51-year-old, whose most recent listed address is in Nashua, was in and out of courtrooms across southern New Hampshire in recent years. Since 2008, he faced nearly two dozen criminal charges in Hillsborough and Rockingham counties, mostly for drug-related offenses.Recently, a pattern had emerged: police would arrest Marshall, he would be released on bail, fail to show up for a court appearance and then re-offend.When gunfire erupted Wednesday night at the Quality Inn, Marshall was wanted on at least two warrants for failure to appear in court. He’d been scheduled to plead guilty March 13 in Hillsborough County Superior Court South in connection to a 2018 case in which he allegedly sold fentanyl to a Nashua police informant and then was caught with heroin in his possession — he never showed up.Two weeks earlier, on Feb. 27, Marshall skipped a plea and sentencing hearing in Hillsborough County Superior Court North in Manchester, where he faced two more drug possession charges.And just nine days before that hearing in Manchester, Nashua police arrested Marshall for possession of heroin, cocaine and crack cocaine.“I can’t speak directly to why he was (released on bail) at any time, but my presumption would be that it had to do with the bail statute,” said Brendon Thurston, the assistant Hillsborough County attorney who prosecuted Marshall in the Manchester case. “The general process with the new bail statute is that most offenders are released.”In 2018, Gov. Chris Sununu signed into law a bail reform bill designed to keep defendants out of pre-trial imprisonment simply because they couldn’t afford bail.

There are two Senate bills this session on the issue. SB 91, which would make wholesale changes to bail reform, is still on the table. SB 314, which passed the Senate Wednesday, makes some revisions based on the recommendation of the Commission on Pre-Trial Detention, but retains the spirit of the original bill.Prosecutors have criticized the law, saying it lets criminals back on the street to re-offend.“The bail bill has made it evident to the offender population that they don’t need to show up (for trial) and they don’t,” Sullivan County Attorney Marc Hathaway told the state Senate during a recent hearing.But even before that law went into effect, Marshall was avoiding his days in court.In 2017, he was released on a $7,500 surety bond following an arrest by Manchester police for possession of crack cocaine and fentanyl.He was scheduled to enter a guilty plea on Feb. 22, 2018, but never showed up, say court records.A month later, Taylor, a bail bondsman who asked that only his first name be used, had to track Marshall to his grandmother’s house.“We located him down in the basement behind a storage door that had been locked from the outside,” Taylor said. “He was in the back of the storage shed underneath some blankets.”Marshall didn’t have any weapons on him at the time, Taylor said. The bail bondsman said he warned the court Marshall was an extreme flight risk if granted bail and had tried to escape in the past.A judge sentenced Marshall to several months in Valley Street jail, but by that time he had already been arrested by Nashua police in a new drug case — the same one he failed to show up in court for on March 13..Correspondents Kimberly Houghton and Jason Schreiber contributed to this report."
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,Sununu opposes Trump moves against Obamacare,"Mar 27, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/politics/state/sununu-opposes-trump-moves-against-obamacare/article_e0e181de-81df-524e-8426-b3a2cdf2cec8.html,"CONCORD — Gov. Chris Sununu is no fan of the decision by the Trump Administration to seek a complete repeal of the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare.He made that clear at a meeting of the Executive Council on Wednesday, as councilors were approving contracts with managed care organizations to run New Hampshire’s Medicaid program over the next five years.When asked by Democratic Councilor Michael Cryans if overturn of Obamacare would have an impact on the contracts, Sununu was direct.“It would absolutely have an impact on this,” he said. “It would be an upheaval of our entire system, not just this contract, but so much of what we do in health care. We don’t want it to happen.”Health and Human Services Commissioner Jeffrey Meyers, standing nearby, agreed.When Cryans asked Sununu if he would write to the president to register the state’s opposition, Sununu listened politely, thanked Cryans and then moved to the next item on the agenda.Democratic Councilor Andru Volinsky pressed the point further.“Following up on the question from councilor Cryans, there are 21 states who have intervened, with both Republican and Democratic legislatures, and I would also ask you to consider intervening in the court case, opposing invalidation of the ACA.”The Justice Department, in a two-sentence letter to the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans on Monday, said it backed the December ruling by a Texas federal judge that the Affordable Care Act violated the U.S. Constitution because it required people to buy health insurance.The judge’s ruling is being appealed to the circuit court, with appeals likely to go all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court.“The good news is that if there is going to be a dismantling of the ACA, it’s not going to happen tomorrow,” said Sununu after the council meeting. “It would be an extreme change to our system without a doubt, something we are not in favor of.”Sununu said expanded Medicaid in particular, a key part of the ACA, has been of great benefit to New Hampshire, at virtually no cost to state taxpayers.“When you look into those contracts and the amount of services both the expansion population is receiving and our ability to provide services in a variety of other areas like the opioid crisis, completely dismantling the ACA would have a shocking effect to our system,” Sununu said, but he stopped short of saying he would write the letter requested at the council meeting.“I know councilor Volinsky brought that up, but I think the time to intervene has actually passed,” Sununu said. “But this is something that’s going to go on for some time … We’ve made our position on it very clear to the administration that the system we have in place is something we support and we’d like to see it maintained going forward.”The Senate voted 22-1 on Wednesday to pass SB 4, which enshrines in state law key provisions of the ACA, including health insurance coverage protections for people with pre-existing conditions and essential health benefits like maternity and newborn care, mental health and substance use disorder services, preventive care and wellness services.“The Trump administration’s relentless attempts to dismantle the ACA threaten Granite Staters’ access to quality, affordable care,” said Senate Majority Leader Dan Feltes. “SB 4 will give New Hampshire citizens the peace of mind that they can get the care they need, when they need it, regardless of what happens at the federal level.”The bill now moves to the House.dsolomon@unionleader.com"
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,$1B in Medicaid contracts signed adding third managed care provider to NH program,"Mar 27, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/politics/state/b-in-medicaid-contracts-signed-adding-third-managed-care-provider/article_fb6588e2-dd7e-500c-97ff-fba6c22c8fbf.html,"CONCORD — The Executive Council on Wednesday approved contracts worth nearly $1 billion to manage Medicaid in New Hampshire, adding a third managed care company to the government-funded health care program for 180,000 low-income Granite Staters.The vote was 4-1, with Republican Councilor Ted Gatsas of Manchester opposed. Gatsas said he did not feel the state pressed hard enough for a better deal.“I asked the three companies, ‘Did anyone ask you if you could do this for less?’ and all three responded, ‘No,’” Gatas said. “I can’t support these contracts when no one even asked them if they could reduce it by half a percent.The former Manchester mayor maintains some of the Medicaid money, which comes from a combination of federal and state sources, is not being accounted for.The contract requires the three companies to spend at least 85 percent of the contract on services, with up to 10 percent for administration and 1.5 percent for profit.Gatsas asked DHHS Commissioner Jeffrey Meyers what happens to the remaining 3.5 percent.“That is a big number that could come back to the state as additional funds to providers who are always looking to get more fund in service to New Hampshire,” said Gatsas. “I’m shocked that’s not a big concern.”Meyers later said that in some years, the cost to the companies for services has been as high as 90 percent of the contract, and in some years lower, but never lower than 85 percent. The contracts are structured to allow for some wiggle room, given the complexity of medical services billing and reimbursement.Companies have lost money on the deal and had to pull out in the past.“That’s the risk the managed care companies take in the program,” said Meyers after the vote. In some years, depending on claims experience, the companies do get to keep more than 1.5 percent.“But that doesn’t mean it all gets put to profit,” he said. “They often put money back into the program, so in other years when the costs are higher, they have a buffer.”Many features have been added to the new five-year contract that place a greater burden on the managed care companies, said Meyers, including coverage for the highest priced prescription drugs which the state had previously paid for.They will also now have to create and monitor managed care plans for the most medically frail clients and those with multiple prescriptions, while also providing staff to help emergency rooms deal with individuals in need of mental health services.“I’m very excited that these contacts were approved,” said Gov. Chris Sununu afterward. “Going forward we’ll have a third option coming in, and that’s a very good thing. It’s more competition for the expanded Medicaid population we’re now serving. We feel confident with the contracts going forward that we can provide quality services for New Hampshire citizens.”The two companies that have run the program for the past five years — Boston Medical Center’s Well Sense Health Plan and Centene’s NH Healthy Families — have established patient and provider relationships and a track record with the state. But the new provider, AmeriHealth Caritas, is largely unknown in New Hampshire.The company has successfully run Medicaid in Pennsylvania and South Carolina for decades, but ran into problems in Iowa, which switched from fee-for-service to managed care for Medicaid in 2016. AmeriHealth bailed out of the Iowa program, claiming it was under-funded.New Hampshire lost one company in the early days of its program as well.The contracts with Wellsense and Centene expire June 30, but will be extended for three months to allow time for the new contracts to be implemented. Meyers had hoped for a council vote in time for a July 1 launch, but councilors wanted two information sessions with the providers that have since been completed.Meyers will present a proposal April 17 to extend the two existing contracts to Aug. 31.Open enrollment will begin in August for coverage under the new contract to begin on Sept. 1.dsolomon@unionleader.com"
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,Granite Status: 2020 Democratic hopefuls putting meat on their policy bones,"Mar 27, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/politics/granite_status/granite-status-democratic-hopefuls-putting-meat-on-their-policy-bones/article_2afadcfe-90c7-564b-a03f-ca1f76f5595d.html,"As national politics pivot from the Mueller report to dominant themes that could move swing voters in 2020, Democratic hopefuls are putting meat on those policy bones as they campaign here in New Hampshire.Sen. Kamala Harris of California hasn’t been to the first-in-the-nation primary state since her initial two-day visit last month.But her state campaign made sure to produce New Hampshire-centric data about Harris’ plan earlier this week to offer all public school teachers a $13,500 pay raise.The Harris team said its analysis found 18 percent of teachers in the Granite State work a second job and the average teacher is paid $57,250, significantly below what similar professionals make here.The pay raise would raise the average teacher’s pay 23 percent for nearly all of the state’s near-15,000 teachers, according to the Harris camp.The plan also calls for increasing teacher pay even higher in income-neediest school districts.Meanwhile, U.S. Rep. John Delaney of Maryland returns for a two-day visit that puts over 60 the number of stops he’s made in New Hampshire since becoming a candidate.This trip is on the heels of Delaney’s new plan to lower prescription drug prices for consumers through a 100 percent excise tax.The tax would be imposed on drug companies on the difference between the cost charged in the United States and the average cost charged to developed nations.“American people are paying too much for prescription drugs, period. This is a major health care issue and a major economic issue and we have an obligation to act. The drug companies allow the citizens of other wealthy nations to free-ride on the backs of US citizens,” Delaney said.Delaney starts his trip today with a roundtable on the opioid epidemic at the NH Hope for Recovery offices in Manchester.The visit includes a town hall forum Friday morning at New England College along with other events in Durham, Dover, Hooksett, Epping and Peterborough.Sununu slams capital gains taxGov. Chris Sununu didn’t use the V (for veto) word but he might as well when asked about the House-endorsed proposal to impose a capital gains tax to generate an $80 million-a-year increase in education aid grants for needy school districts.While two school districts have already sued the state over education funding, Sununu pushed back on the idea the state needs a new revenue source to target more money to school districts above the per-pupil adequacy grant.“That’s a terrible idea. At the end of the day, we are a top-10 state in the country for funding our schools; we have a great system,” Sununu told reporters Wednesday.The two-term governor hasn’t offered any specifics on how to increase education aid grants but maintains there’s enough room in his proposed two-year state budget plan to include some if that’s what lawmakers want to do.“We are spending over $13 billion without a single tax. There is a lot of flexibility in my budget,” Sununu said.“Given the flexibility, the Legislature can respond to some of the outcries in other parts of the state.”Who has co-sponsored the capital gains tax? That would be Senate Majority Leader and potential Democratic candidate for governor Dan Feltes of Concord.Feltes pointed out the bill raised the current exemption under the state's tax on interest and dividends, which will be a tax cut for lower income residents and small firms.""Governor Sununu opposes this bill that cuts taxes for tens of thousands of Granite State seniors, for hundreds of our smaller businesses (and) helps all property taxpayers with education funding simply because it closes a loophole that benefits the wealthiest 1 percent,"" Feltes said in a statement.Sununu also criticized the lawsuit approach of achieving education finance reform.“I don’t care about lawsuits. You know who only benefits from lawsuits? Lawyers,” Sununu said.Who might Sununu be referring to with that shot? That would be Executive Councilor and potential 2020 Democratic candidate for governor Andru Volinsky of Concord, one of the lead lawyers in the original Claremont lawsuit that caused the NH Supreme Court to decide the reliance on the local property tax was unconstitutional.Sununu’s response also follows a New Hampshire Democratic Party campaign in several parts of the state to criticize the governor for failing to earmark in his spending plan any additional education aid for poor school districts.Senate approves bipartisan right to sueThere have been plenty of partisan battles already this year over access to the state court system.But the Senate came together as one at least on one proposal, the bill of Sen. Harold French, R-Franklin, to give any citizen the right to bring suit against any state or government entity that violates a person’s rights under the state Constitution. French said his New Hampshire Civil Rights Act would give citizens the rights in state and federal courts the power they now have to challenge in federal court an action that violates the U.S. Constitution.“This legislation will fix that and give every Granite Stater the constitutional protections they deserve,” French said.The bill (SB 36) now moves on the House of Representatives for its review.The Senate also endorsed on a bipartisan vote adjustments to the 2018 bail reform law on Wednesday.(For more Granite Status, go to www.unionleader.com.)klandrigan@unionleader.comHassan keynotes health care panelU.S. Sen. Maggie Hassan, D-NH, will open a timely panel on the nation’s health care system April 5 at the Warren B. Rudman Center at the University of New Hampshire School of Law in Concord.The Concord Coalition is sponsoring the event, which is free and open to the public.Those on the panel include Joseph Antos, an expert on health care and retirement at the American Enterprise Institute; Trish Riley, executive director of the National Academy for State Health Policy; and John McDonough, a health professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.McDonough, a Democrat, was one of the legislative architects of the universal health care law that Massachusetts adopted under then-governor. Mitt Romney.Lucy Hodder, UNH law professor and director of health law and policy, will moderate the panel.Abortion gag rule fightSununu said he’s keeping an eye on it but it’s too early to conclude federal grants available to Planned Parenthood of Northern New England and other providers are at risk while Congress fights with the Trump administration over its so-called domestic gag rule.Formally proposed March 5, the rule would bar PPNNE and other providers who perform or offer referrals for abortions to receive grants under Title X that pays for birth control and other family planning services for low-income patients.Abortion opponents have long sought this change, maintaining the groups providing abortion services should not get any federal support.Advocates for Planned Parenthood warn if enforced this could reduce by $2 million federal grants to the state, which not only go to Planned Parenthood but also to community health centers that make these referrals.Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-NH, has been leading the fight against the gag rule in the Senate along with her colleague Sen. Hassan.An abortion rights supporter, Sununu said this gag rule plan has already led to litigation and it’s still a long way from having any financial impact in New Hampshire.“I guess I would say we are a ways away from having to understand that and see whether it is truly going to affect us,” Sununu said adding he’d be “shocked” if it led to any cutbacks in federal grants later this spring.Granite State Taxpayers tap SununuGov. Sununu will head up the lineup of speakers for a “Preserve the New Hampshire Advantage” rally this Saturday on the State House lawn starting at 10 a.m.”Democrats control the Legislature; only the governor’s veto can deter them,” saidRay Chadwick, chairman of GST.”Rally attendees intend to send a message and support the New Hampshire Advantage.”The rally comes at an opportune time since the House Finance Committee faces an April 4 deadline to finish work on its proposed two-year state budget.Eversource hosts clean energy forumAs part of NH Energy Week, Eversource and other leaders in the field will host a panel discussion on how energy users are expanding the use of clean energy while maintaining reliability for consumers.Charlotte Ancel, Eversource’s director of energy strategy development, will speak on the firm’s work on renewable energy projects along with energy efficiency programs to reduce the carbon footprint.The panel begins at 8 a.m. today at the Grappone Center in Concord.Pot legalization bill clears another hurdleThe House Ways and Means Committee endorsed, 14-6, the House-passed bill (HB 481) to legalize marijuana sales. The panel adjusted the proposed tax rates, making it 5 percent on sales from those growing their own and 9 percent for pot purchases at retail stores.The House has already endorsed this measure and the real fight lies ahead in the atate Senate where the state’s law enforcement community will surely turn up the heat of its opposition to this reform.Sununu has already said he opposes the measure so advocates know they likely need a veto-proof majority in the Senate if they are going to ultimately succeed this year.Negron makes official his 2020 congressional bidFormer state representativeSteve Negronof Nashua decided with the coming of spring that he’d confirm a badly kept secret that he’ll be mounting a second challenge to U.S. Rep.Annie Kuster, D-NH, in the 2nd Congressional District.”Since U.S. Rep. Ann McLane Kuster has taken office, New Hampshire families and taxpayers continue to be underrepresented, undervalued, and voiceless on Washington’s spending craze. Kuster’s allies who now control Congress continue to ignore the plight of fiscal injury at $22 trillion in debt and climbing — this is irresponsible and shows contempt for our future grandchildren.”An Air Force veteran and founder of his own defense contracting firm, Negron beat five GOP rivals in 2018 to narrowly win the GOP nomination.Kuster decisively won a fourth two-year term over Negron last November.A Democratic Party spokesman said Kuster will continue acting on behalf of working families.Kuster advocates against online sales taxRep. Kuster and a bipartisan team of House members offered legislation Wednesday to protect many New Hampshire businesses from having to collect online sales taxes levied in other states.The bill would exempt small firms that generate less than $10 million a year in sales from having to collect these taxes since the U.S. Supreme Court last year ordered states must honor with the Wayfair decision from South Dakota.”Small businesses in New Hampshire should not be forced to collect sales tax for states across the country,” Kuster said. “An online sales tax would subject small businesses in the Granite State to nearly 10,000 taxing jurisdictions across the country, creating burdensome red tape and causing headaches for small business owners.”Members of the House from Wisconsin, South Carolina and California are on the bill.Climate change expert speaks in ManchesterAs the Capitol Hill debate over the Green Deal rages on, an author and noted expert on climate change will host a question and answer session today for journalists at the Nackey S.

Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,Bill to impose gun-free school zones heads for second House vote,"Mar 27, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/politics/state/bill-to-impose-gun-free-school-zones-heads-for-second/article_973a042a-4393-522e-9591-1ed69ab937bb.html,"CONCORD — A bill to declare gun-free zones on school property across the state is on its way to the House for a second vote, having cleared the Criminal Justice Committee in a 10-8 party line vote on Wednesday.The bill (HB 564) bans possession of firearms on school property, including buildings, grounds, school buses and vans.Exceptions would include anyone picking up or dropping off a student, provided the firearms remain in a motor vehicle.School boards will have the option of authorizing exemptions under certain circumstances, and the law will not apply to law enforcement, resource officers or members of the military when on duty.School districts in several New Hampshire communities have tried to impose gun-free zones, but a state law giving the state Legislature sole authority on all gun-related issues rendered those local decisions moot, according to the Attorney General.Rather than allow individual school board to make such decisions, resulting in a hodgepodge of conditions across the state, Democratic lawmakers opted for a bill that would establish gun-free zones on all school property.The bill first passed the House, 194-154, without a single Republican vote on Feb. 27, after clearing the Education Committee. It was then referred to the Criminal Justice Committee for a second round of hearings, and will now come back to the House, after which it will cross over to the Senate.The debate among committee members in Criminal Justice reflected the divide among the many witnesses who crowded hearing rooms for both the Education and Criminal Justice committee hearings.“One group feels that having guns on school property promotes safety, the other group feels keeping guns off school property promotes safety,” said Rep. Linn Opderbecke, D-Dover. “It’s just a basic disagreement and that’s what we’re going to vote on.”The House passed two other gun control bills last week, one requiring background checks for all firearms sales or transfers, and another imposing a waiting period between the purchase and delivery of a gun.The Democratic majority in the House also defeated a Republican-sponsored bill that would have expanded the state’s “Stand Your Ground” law to allow the use of deadly force in defending a third party against any felony offense.Republican Gov. Chris Sununu on Wednesday reiterated his position that New Hampshire gun laws are fine exactly the way they are, and confirmed that he will veto the bills if they land on his desk.”New Hampshire is a pro-gun state but it is also a pro-gun safety state,” said Zandra Rice Hawkins, state director for GunSense NH. “{/span}There is no reason those values need be at odds with one another, and we urge the governor to listen to his constituents, the experts and the data before making public policy decisions he may come to regret.”dsolomon@unionleader.com"
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,Letter: Quality education,"Mar 27, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/opinion/letters_to_editor/letter-quality-education/article_1f257f58-8fe8-5a91-b755-ef65d6ed59aa.html,"Quality educationTo the Editor: It had never occurred to me before today, but it’s clear that the wave of so-called “democratic socialism” has hit New Hampshire Democrats in an unfortunate area: education.The Democrats at the State House are staunchly opposed to educational choice, and any measure proposed to provide any innovation in education, including programs like Learn Everywhere, the Education Tax Credit Scholarship Program, and the New Hampshire Career Academies. They complain that Learn Everywhere takes away local school district control, and that the Education Tax Credit Scholarship Program and the New Hampshire Career Academy divert money away from public schools. For Democrats, public schools are the only permissible recipient of taxpayer dollars. They opposed the creation of New Hampshire Career Academies, proposed by Gov. Chris Sununu, even though it offers students a path to free college.Unlike Sununu, the Democrat approach is to force every student into the same system. Instead of focusing on better educational outcomes, opportunities and choice, they just want to throw more money at a cookie-cutter system. Why do they believe that individualized education must be avoided at all costs?The Democrats’ educational vision, if allowed to be realized, would ensure that New Hampshire students are trapped in the same system irrespective of their needs, desires, and goals. Their motto might as well be, “One standard-issue education per child.’But children don’t come with one uniform set of needs, desires, and goals, and a quality education should reflect that.DAVID SAMRAAtkinson"
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,Kathy Sullivan: Gov. Sununu's budget earmarks set a bad precedent,"Mar 27, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/opinion/columnists/kathy-sullivan-gov-sununu-s-budget-earmarks-set-a-bad/article_9f4581ea-428f-5a19-8305-264ef32306f7.html,"GOV. CHRIS SUNUNU wants New Hampshire taxpayers to donate $100,000 to the Salem, New Hampshire Boys and Girls Club. He also wants taxpayers from around the Granite State to pay $1,000,000 to refurbish the Seabrook Town Hall, and to foot a $300,000 bill for improvements to athletic fields in Manchester.Are these the priorities on which New Hampshire should be spending its state tax revenues?According to Sununu, the answer is yes, as these are among the plethora of spending requests that he has put into his state budget proposal. Longtime State House reporter Garry Rayno compared the budget request to a kid in a candy store with a cash-filled wallet.Sununu proposes to use $160,000,000 in surplus revenues — including a $63,000,000 surplus from the state’s Education Trust Fund — to pay for a number of projects. A few would pay for some badly needed facilities for the Department of Health and Human Services. However, according to press reports, the state’s operating budget does not include the money to actually staff and operate all of them.Many of Sununu’s other proposals are raising eyebrows. Take that Salem Boys and Girls Club item, for example. There is no question that Boys and Girls Clubs do great work. But typically state government does not fund the clubs. Donations, grants and sometimes local government money pay for their facilities and programs, not the state budget.And why, of all the private programs for kids in New Hampshire, the Salem club? When asked, Sununu’s spokesman said that it was prompted by Sen. Chuck Morse and other local “stakeholders.” He had to correct that later to say that Morse actually had not been involved. When it was pointed out that Sununu’s policy director was running for town office in Salem and citing his work on state budgets in a campaign interview, Sununu’s spokesman said the staffer was not involved in the decision.Just a coincidence.Then there is the $1,500,000 earmark for the Franklin Whitewater Park. This may be a worthwhile project for the city of Franklin. But why this particular project? Why $1,500,000 for a parking garage renovation in Laconia? How were they chosen?As reported by the Union Leader’s Dave Solomon, there were no public hearings, no committees and no formal review process in deciding what towns and what projects would receive money.Let’s assume for the sake of discussion that the state should spend this money on these special municipal government projects and private nonprofit agencies. There should have been some public notice to all cities and towns, and to all non-profits providing community services, that the candy store was open. There should have been an opportunity to apply for grants with a thorough, fair and transparent vetting process.Instead, it was done in secret. There were no guidelines and no formal application process, just Sununu picking favorite communities and favorite projects. It is irresponsible to spend taxpayer money this way.Sununu also proposes to pay $10,000,000 to people hurt financially in the FRM Ponzi scheme a decade ago. I am sorry people lost money, but why compensate people hurt by this fraud and not those harmed by the Dusty Old Cars scandal? Why not provide funds to the city of Berlin to keep its elementary school open, instead of letting it close because of the continuing drop in state educational aid?With all due respect, New Hampshire’s children are more worthy of Sununu’s largesse with surplus taxpayer dollars than people who lost money in a private investment 10 years ago. The education of New Hampshire’s children is an actual state responsibility under our Constitution.Sununu’s earmarks — and the opaque way he picked the beneficiaries — are wrong, and they set a very bad precedent for future budgets."
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,Manchester officer's widow urges lawmakers to keep death penalty,"Mar 26, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/politics/state/manchester-officer-s-widow-urges-lawmakers-to-keep-death-penalty/article_086d50bc-f923-55af-8036-60152273b297.html,"CONCORD — The widow of murdered Manchester police officer Michael Briggs testified for the first time in support of the death penalty in New Hampshire, as supporters of repeal feel they are inching closer to success.The legislature passed a repeal bill last year, but it was vetoed by Gov. Chris Sununu and the Senate failed to override. The House has already passed a repeal bill again this year by a veto-proof margin, and the Senate appears poised to do likewise.With the stakes so high, advocates on both sides brought their A-team to Tuesday’s hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee on the House-passed bill, HB 455. It would replace the death penalty with life in prison without the possibility of parole for all capital crimes.Former attorney general and U.S. senator Kelly Ayotte testified in support of the death penalty, while former attorney general Greg Smith argued for repeal. Several representatives of clergy and law enforcement, murder victim families and falsely accused suspects also testified over the three-hour hearing.But the key witness was Laura Briggs, because the issue underlying the entire debate was whether the killer of her husband will be put to death if capital punishment is repealed in New Hampshire.“Other states have repealed and after they’ve done that, people on death row have had their death sentence commuted,” she told the committee. “If that happens here, it will mean the person who killed my husband will get no punishment.”Michael Addison, who killed Briggs with a gunshot to the head during a Manchester crime spree in 2006, was already facing life in prison before the murder.Despite her call for justice on behalf of her husband, Briggs said, “the death penalty is about protecting society from evil. It’s not about an eye for an eye or revenge.”“We’ve had many in New Hampshire who are not interested in redemption,” she said. “They take pleasure in hearing that they’ve hurt people. The person who killed my husband was smirking in court. He had no interest in feeling remorseful. Didn’t care about what he did. He had met Mike before and Mike helped save his life when he himself had been shot.”From the heartBob Blaisdell, a longtime lobbyist for local and state police departments, accompanied the normally reserved wife of the slain officer, who decided it was time to testify.“Laura was speaking for Mike, who no longer has a voice,” said Blaisdell. “That came right from the heart.”Briggs described her husband to lawmakers as “a good person, a good dad. He wasn’t perfect. No one is, but he was a genuinely good person.”“I’m going to speak for him today because I know he was for the death penalty, and I know he was upset when another law enforcement officer was killed in 1997 and no one received the death penalty.“He was pretty disappointed about that,” she said.Rookie Epsom police officer Jeremy Charron was shot to death as he checked a suspicious vehicle at a popular swimming hole in 1997. The shooter, Gordon Perry, pleaded guilty to capital murder in exchange for a life sentence, while his accomplice, Kevin Paul, was sentenced to 16 to 50 years in prison and paroled in 2015.Briggs now has an adult son working in law enforcement, and said her thoughts are with him.“I would like to know that if the same thing happened to him, that he would get fair justice,” she said.Ayotte, who prosecuted the Briggs case, urged the committee to take the testimony of Laura Briggs to heart.“I had the privilege of getting to know her during trial, when we prosecuted Michael Addison for the murder of her husband,” said Ayotte.“She’s just a wonderful person and I hope of all the people you listen to today, you will listen to her, because she has suffered and gone through so much as a result of having her husband murdered.”‘Arbitrary and selective’Former AG Smith called the death penalty “highly arbitrary and selective.”“We’ve had 1,000 to 1,500 murder cases in New Hampshire since the last execution in the 1930s, and I know personally there were other cases involving the killing of police officers in which defendants did not get the death penalty,” he said. “That’s 1,500 murder cases, all having circumstances we could describe as terrible, yet in 80 years, we’ve only exercised this against one person.”Concord Attorney Michael Lewis, an assistant attorney general from 2007 to 2013, said the Department of Justice was so divided over seeking the death penalty that top prosecutors below Ayotte declined to participate in the Addison case and another 2008 capital murder case involving a New Castle millionaire convicted in the murder-for-hire death of his handyman. John Brooks was convicted of capital murder and is now serving a life sentence.“You will see the absence of top prosecutor, the most senior staff, in both cases,” said Lewis. “The current deputy attorney general, the most recent deputy attorney general, and the head of the civil bureau all were prosecutors in the criminal bureau at the time and all did not work on either capital murder cases because of conscientious objections.”The Department of Justice declined to comment.Repeal advocates remained confident after Tuesday’s three-hour hearing.“We’re feeling good about the Senate vote based on the vote of last year and newly elected senators who previously voted on this issue in the House,” said Jeanne Hruska, political director for the ACLU-NH, who predicted the Senate would reach the critical mark of 16 votes for a veto-proof majority.dsolomon@unionleader.com"
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,Bail reform faces critical test in Senate this week,"Mar 25, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/politics/state/bail-reform-faces-critical-test-in-senate-this-week/article_96813eb3-ba21-52f6-974b-e6b17262f7f2.html,"CONCORD — An ambitious bail reform initiative for New Hampshire courts has been in place less than a year, yet the Senate this week is expected to vote on two competing bills — one aimed at refining the changes, the other reversing course.Opponents of the bipartisan reform measure enacted in 2018 claim it has put dangerous criminals back on the street, while supporters say it’s allowing people who haven’t been convicted of anything to go back to their jobs and homes as productive members of society while awaiting trial.Consequences of the new approach to bail have been so extreme, according to law enforcement and some county prosecutors, that a course correction is necessary.“The bail bill has made it evident to the offender population that they don’t need to show up (for trial) and they don’t,” says Sullivan County Attorney Mark Hathaway. At a Feb. 19 Senate hearing, he cited a list of defendants who were released on personal recognizance while awaiting trial, some of whom re-offended.“There are new crimes being committed while out on bail, multiple failures to appear. We’ve arrested some people two or three times and, by-and-large, they still get out on personal recognizance bail, or a bail based on what they can afford. That’s what’s going on in your courts, in your communities, and it should concern all of us,” said Hathaway.“New Hampshire has a problem. These are not isolated cases. There is a laundry list of these stories and if we ignore this, we do so at our peril.”Anecdotal evidenceTuftonboro Police Chief Andrew Shagoury cited the case of Mark Dennis, who was out on personal recognizance bail from a previous arrest in November when he stabbed someone in Keene, and 12 hours later was released again on personal recognizance bail under the same conditions.Shagoury also cited the case of a teacher’s aide caught with sexual images of a minor, who was released on personal recognizance even though he said he might offend again or might hurt himself because of the pending charges.Supporters of the reform that was implemented by SB 556 in 2018 offered some anecdotal evidence of their own, regarding lower levels of incarceration and the impact of the new law on individual cases.Phil Rondeau, with ACLU-NH, described cases using first names only. Richard from Cheshire County, he said, was arrested after a man attacked his girlfriend and he fought back.“He works as a foreman at a moving company,” said Rondeau. “People rely on him. He would have lost his job if he was held on cash bail. He’s also the primary caregiver for his disabled father, who would have been left alone.”Bail reform may need some fine-tuning, but the law is working as intended, according to Jeanne Hruska, political director for the New Hampshire ACLU.“The new law ensures that judges take into account financial means, so (defendants) are not detained pre-trial only because they cannot afford bail,” she said in testimony supporting the existing law.Competing legislationEach side is represented by legislation now before the Senate.SB 314, sponsored by Democratic Sens. Martha Hennessey and Dan Feltes, makes some technical changes based on the recommendation of the Commission on Pre-Trial Detention that was set up as part of the reform effort, but it retains the spirit of the original bill.SB 91 was sponsored by Republican Sen. Jeb Bradley at the request of the N.H. Police Chiefs Association. It makes wholesale changes that critics say would essentially turn the clock back to the way things were before the new bail law was enacted.If SB 91 becomes law, judges would once again be able to cite homelessness as a reason to impose cash bail, while disregarding the fact that the defendant is a single parent or the sole source of household income.Drug use or addiction would once again become a factor judges can consider when determining if someone is a flight risk, and the judicial standard necessary to hold someone as a flight risk or danger would become “clear and convincing” evidence, as opposed to the higher standard now in place, “the preponderance of the evidence.”“This bill would undo bail reform and go back to the system where people are detained simply because they cannot afford bail,” said Hruska.On the right trackHennessey believes the state is on the right track and that her bill will clarify that judges have a lot of flexibility in deciding whether defendants pose a danger or flight risk.“Last year’s reform set about to accomplish two key goals,” she said. “One was to prevent people from being detained pre-trial, sometimes for months and months at a time simply because they cannot afford cash bail, and a second to expand prosecutors’ ability to detain people pre-trial without bail if they are a danger to themselves or others. I personally believe our state is succeeding in accomplishing these goals.”Gov. Chris Sununu signed the original reform bill into law, but agrees that some changes are necessary.“I think everyone agrees something needs to be done,” he said in a recent interview. “I know there are these competing bills out there. I’m not sure which one will ultimately end up on my desk, but I’m happy to see some reform will be taking shape.”“There are a lot of instances where we’re finding there could be unintended consequences with the new system. It’s important that we get it right. I think most people just want to see the system be successful.”dsolomon@unionleader.com"

These potentially dramatic cuts in funding would hurt both shipyard workers and the entire Seacoast region.”The diversion of $224 million in funding for military construction projects at the shipyard was on a list provided by the Trump administration last week on Monday, March 18, 2019.The funding affects four projects: a $110 million dry dock improvement; $62 million for a consolidated paint, blast and rubber facility; a $12 million warehouse; and $40 million for an extended crane rail.Gov. Chris Sununu said he is concerned about the potential loss of funding, but added that Congress should provide the funding for a wall along the southern border.“Obviously we don’t want to see funding diverted out of New Hampshire and our programs. We’re not one of the super large states that have a lot of other financial opportunities when it comes to the National Guard or other military operations, so we want to make sure those funds aren’t diverted,” he said. “At the same time, I’ll say the crisis on the border is real. It has a real impact on our state.”“When you see the amount of drugs that are coming across that border that impact our citizens right here in New Hampshire every day, something has to be done, for sure,” he said. “So my message is Congress needs to do its job and provide not just funding for the border wall, but take up immigration as a whole.”dsolomon@unionleader.com"

Chris Sununu, the New Hampshire Department of Education and DOE Commissioner Frank Edelblut, claiming the state has failed to provide funding for an adequate education, which the New Hampshire Supreme Court deemed a constitutional mandate in the Claremont lawsuit decision from the late 1990s.“The state is just not providing the funding that they should,” Picard said.The Winchester board had been studying the problems with education funding in New Hampshire for some time, Picard said, and looked for possible solutions. Going after the underlying funding systems seems to be the best approach, she said.Claremont and other property-poor towns in New Hampshire sued the state in the 1980s, claiming that relying on local property taxes to fund education left students in towns like Claremont at a permanent financial and educational disadvantage.Currently, the state grants $3,636 per pupil to school districts throughout New Hampshire in what are called adequacy grants. ConVal spends $18,000 per pupil, Monadnock $17,000, and Winchester spends $14,000 for its high school students and about $18,000 for elementary and middle school students. The lawsuit seeks to up the state grants to more than $10,000 per pupil.Picard said the state’s funding formula ignores major expenses that districts are required to pay.“It just doesn’t take into account the cost of paying teachers, or the cost of transportation,” she said.The funding gap leaves towns like Winchester to make up the difference by raising property taxes, she said. That can drive away property owners and potential new residents, leaving the town with deflated property values.In the meantime, some state aid for schools has been decreasing, she said. That means in Winchester, the rise in property taxes has outpaced the rise in the school budget because of the decreasing state aid."

Chris Sununu’s budget, which they say fails young adults struggling with student debt.“I am here today because students like me are a part of a crisis, and Governor Sununu’s budget does nothing to address this crisis. Governor Sununu proposed a budget that flat funds state aid for higher education,” Junior Joey Ramirez said.Ramirez is a student senator and says with New Hampshire being ranked among one of the most expensive states to attend college, ignoring the student debt problem is not an option.“Democrats are fighting for a future where those who want to stay here pursue higher education and better the state can do so without the tens of thousands of dollars of crippling student debt,” Ramirez said.Junior Lindy Hamilton said Sununu’s budget will push more high school graduates out of the state.“In a world where higher education is the key to opportunity and success, it is critical New Hampshire students, like me and my peers, are not burdened with the increasing rates of student debt,” Hamilton said.State Sen. David Watters, D-Dover, said student debt slows down students who want to start their own lives after college.“The student debt crisis robs our young people of their financial freedom, and that steals from them the opportunities they worked so hard to gain. Governor Sununu’s budget does nothing to lessen this burden on the next generation of Granite Staters,” Watters said.Watters said Sununu’s plan will almost certainly lead to tuition increases. Democrats want to lower tuition rates and fees, he said.In his February budget address, Sununu proposed a $24 million investment to double the capacity of health care and nursing programs within the university system.“The answer to the high burdens of college debt is not to give free diplomas to everyone; it is to create a system that incentivizes students to stay and work in our great state through a student debt assistance program,” Sununu said.Sununu said the state piloted this idea within the area of regenerative medicine last year.This year, he plans to build on that by restructuring cash funds, leading the nation with a new $32 million student loan assistance program available to all students at no additional cost to taxpayers, he said.The New Hampshire Democratic Party held similar events Monday at Plymouth State University and Keene State College."

DAVID LANE/UNION LEADER


When the Common Man restaurant group decided to transition from plastic to paper straws, it ran into a challenge: most of the paper products on the market don’t hold up.“There’s not a lot of good quality straws on the market to be frank with you. There’s only one American company that’s making a good wrapped paper straw,” said Sean Brown, the company’s operating officer. “Making something that’s durable, that somebody’s going to enjoy drinking a beverage out of for a long period of time is not common.”The restaurant group initially made the switch last year, but provided plastic straws to customers upon request. As of this January, though, Common Man restaurants will stock only paper straws.If some lawmakers get their way, restaurants throughout the state will be following Common Man’s lead.Last week, by a margin of 196-146, the House passed HB 558, which prohibits food service companies from providing plastic straws unless customers specifically ask for them.It also passed a similar law, HB 560, that would ban restaurants or stores larger than 1,000 square feet from providing disposable plastic bags by a margin of 201-145.The legislation is designed to cut down on the amount of plastic trash that fills landfills, sidewalks, tree branches and waterways.Businesses that have already made the switch say that it comes at a cost, but customers generally tend to appreciate the environmentally friendly move.“We do have some customers who request a plastic straw because they don’t like how the paper straw holds up — it starts breaking down in about 20 minutes (once it’s in liquid),” said David Booth, owner of Green Bike smoothies in Manchester.“But overall, most people praise us for it,” he added.Greenbike uses entirely compost-able serving ware now and also sells reusable metal straws. About 20 customers have purchased a set since Christmas, Booth said.Municipal recycling and waste officials are also eager to see less plastic.“Sometimes if they’re on the top of the trash pile they get blown away and that becomes a litter problem — you might see a plastic bag in a tree,” said Sally Hyland, Nashua’s recycling coordinator.But the bags can be even more troublesome when they do make it in the bin.While most grocery stores allow customers to return used plastic bags for free, few people follow through.Those that get thrown in the trash often end up in landfills where they never decompose, but as often as not people end up trying to put them in their recycling bins, Hyland said.Recyclers use a variety of machines to sort paper out from cans, bottles and other materials.Plastic bags “get wrapped around the rollers on a conveyor belt. When that happens, the operation has to be shut down,” Hyland said.It costs time and often results in extra fees passed on to towns.It’s unclear whether the Senate has the votes to pass the plastic bag and straw bans, and if it does, whether Gov. Chris Sununu will sign them.But Hyland said she already sees many stores promoting reusable canvas shopping bags. And restaurants like Common Man are considering doing away with all the plastic serving and carryout materials they use.“There’s always going to be more that we can do,” Brown said. But “in the big picture, the response has been overwhelmingly positive.”













Legislation being considered in New Hampshire is designed to cut down on the amount of plastic trash that fills landfills.

This will address concerns of civilly committed psychiatric patients being inappropriately housed in the Secure Psychiatric Unit at the Men’s Prison, as well as long-term boarding of psychiatric patients in hospital emergency departments.Children’s inpatient care will move from the New Hampshire Hospital to a more appropriate treatment setting focused on their specific needs under Sununu’s budget. It also earmarks funding for additional transitional housing, which will provide a “step down” for psychiatric patients to ease transition back into the community and free up inpatient beds.Gov.

Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,New Hampshire officials unhappy with neighbors' nuclear option,"Mar 23, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/business/energy/new-hampshire-officials-unhappy-with-neighbors-nuclear-option/article_4ad5439e-4469-5df5-a3e7-dccc44b26f45.html,"The energy market in New England is a shared system, delicately negotiated across state lines.Environmental policies in the region — less so.As most of the New England states pursue aggressive goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and transition to clean energy sources, some of their methods are irking New Hampshire officials, who foresee Granite Staters picking up the tab for those policies in the form of higher power bills.The latest cause for disagreement is a 10-year clean energy contract Connecticut awarded to its only nuclear power plant, which was struggling to compete against natural gas-fired generators and might have been forced to close without the special deal.In a March 15 letter filled with opaque language, the six New England governors committed to finding “market-based mechanisms” that “value the contribution” of nuclear plants while simultaneously ensuring the residents of one state don’t pay for another state’s policies.It’s unclear what those mechanisms might be, though, and officials from all six states and ISO New England, the nonprofit that manages the region’s wholesale energy market, declined to elaborate.Massachusetts’ and Vermont’s top energy officials refused to talk about the agreement at all, while those in Maine and Connecticut never responded to requests for comment. Officials in some of the states did discuss the regional discord on background but refused to go on the record.Gov. Chris Sununu, meanwhile, is adamant that New Hampshire won’t pay for other states to subsidize clean energy.“While we have agreed to evaluate this issue, I remain steadfast in my support for the ratepayers of our state, especially those on fixed incomes,” he said in a statement accompanying the March 15 letter. “New Hampshire citizens will not voluntarily fund the expensive public policy mandates of another state.”But how New Hampshire could prevent other states from pursuing policies that could lead to higher regional energy rates — and experts disagree about whether costs will increase — is also unclear.NH’s energy goals lowerThe Granite State is somewhat of an outlier in the region when it comes to renewable energy goals.Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Vermont have all set targets of reducing their greenhouse gas emissions to at least 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050. Connecticut aims to reduce its emissions to 80 percent below 2001 levels by 2050.On the renewable energy side, the aspirations are equally ambitions.Massachusetts and Connecticut want 40 percent of their energy coming from renewable or clean sources, like nuclear, by 2030. Rhode Island wants to get there by 2035, while Vermont is striving for 90 percent renewable energy and Maine for 100 percent by 2050.New Hampshire’s stated goal, as outlined last year in Sununu’s 10-year energy plan, is to have 25 percent of its power coming from renewables by 2025.“I think some of the states have gotten quite a bit more aggressive in funding the development of renewable energy in the last couple of years,” said David Patton, president of Potomac Economics, which provides economic analysis for ISO New England.“The costs for a variety of renewable technologies has been falling, so we could be moving toward a point where they could be economic without state support,” he added. “But that has not generally been the case to date.”Disrupting the market?Last year, Massachusetts awarded a contract to a Danish company to build an 800-megawatt offshore wind farm — what will be the largest in the country — off the coast of Martha’s Vineyard.Rhode Island announced a contract for a 400-megawatt wind farm off its coast at the same time. Both projects are benefiting from federal tax credits and state laws that prioritize the development of wind power. The companies also are forecasting prices that could undercut competitors.And in December, Connecticut awarded a round of special zero-carbon power contracts equivalent to 45 percent of the state’s energy needs. The biggest recipient was the Millstone Power Station, which is owned by Dominion Energy.Without the contract, Dominion convinced state regulators, the 2,100-megawatt plant was at risk of closing by 2023. That closure could have increased the entire region’s greenhouse gas emissions by 25 percent, according to Connecticut’s Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, because fossil-fuel plants would have assumed most of the burden.Until the state changed its rules in fall 2018, Millstone had been shut out from bidding against solar and wind generators for Connecticut’s zero-carbon contracts. And in the open energy market, it was struggling to compete against cheaper natural gas-fired plants.Other power generators and groups opposed to nuclear power plants quickly panned the new rule as a handout to Dominion.And New Hampshire officials see it as the latest example of states interfering with the energy market to pick winners and losers.“When states intervene and disrupt the market, as Connecticut has done here, it places the vast majority of cost-competitive resources at a disadvantage, drives up the cost of electricity and leaves taxpayers on the hook to foot the bill,” said Jared Chicoine, director of the Office of Strategic Initiatives, which oversees New Hampshire’s energy policies.“Instead, the entire region would be better suited to continue allowing the electricity market to select the best set of resources at the lowest cost while maintaining a reliable and resilient electric grid,” he said.Connecticut officials did not respond to multiple requests for comment.Not always bestIf done properly, subsidizing renewable energy can both reduce emissions and costs, experts say, but there are also examples of those policies backfiring.Germany, for example, has invested heavily in solar and wind generation. By 2014, it had reduced its greenhouse gas emissions to 27 percent below 1990 levels, according to a paper written by energy policy expert Richard Martin in the MIT Technology Review.But in 2015, the country’s greenhouse gas emissions actually rose, in large part because coal- and gas-fired power plants had to keep running to ensure a steady power supply when the sun wasn’t shining and the wind wasn’t blowing.As a result, Germany was producing more energy than it needed, Martin wrote.That’s not the case in New England, but it’s something to be wary of as states try to meet their emissions goals, said Ashley Brown, executive director of the Harvard Electricity Policy Group.“It’s not just a question of whether New Hampshire is subsidizing Massachusetts’ or Rhode Island’s environmental goals; it’s a question of whether they’re doing it in an inefficient way or for certain resources that aren’t economically viable,” he said.One solution popular among experts is carbon pricing, whereby a fee is added to energy from generators that emit more greenhouse gases, thereby creating a market incentive for clean energy.Gordon van Welie, the president and CEO of ISO New England, recently called it an “elegant and simpler way to achieve clean-energy goals through the markets without distorting competition.”But the New England states haven’t indicated any interest in instituting carbon pricing, according to ISO New England spokesman Marcia Blomberg, and the nonprofit isn’t sure it has the jurisdiction to implement the system on its own.The states say they’ll be engaging in discussions about “market-based mechanisms” to settle their disagreements in the coming months, but none of the officials contacted for this story offered a specific example of what that might entail.In the meantime, New Hampshire’s neighbors aren’t waiting around.“There is a cost of inaction in addressing the very real effects of climate change,” said Robert Beadle, a spokesman for Rhode Island’s Office of Energy Resources.tfeathers@unionleader.com"
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,Democrats put $168M Sununu 'revitalization fund' on hold to review spending of surplus an item at a time,"Mar 21, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/politics/state/democrats-put-m-sununu-revitalization-fund-on-hold-to-review/article_ac9614bb-eb91-57fb-aa3a-a669d3cd028b.html,"CONCORD — Municipal officials from across the state surrounded Gov. Chris Sununu on Thursday and showered him with praise for recommending millions of dollars in state surplus for local projects through what he’s calling the Governor’s Capital Infrastructure Revitalization Fund.Democrats, however, are putting that infrastructure fund on hold so that each project can be considered individually as part of the traditional state budgeting process.“We removed all the sections of the infrastructure fund and we’re working on what we’ll add back,” said Rep. Mary Jane Wallner, D-Concord, chair of the powerful House Finance Committee.Certain items are likely to be revived, such as the $26 million allocation for construction of a 60-bed forensic psychiatric hospital that is needed to close the Secure Psychiatric Unit at the state prison. But the fate of other items on the $168 million wish list for fiscal years 2019, 2020 and 2021 is uncertain.Against that backdrop, Sununu’s media event seemed targeted directly at Democratic lawmakers who control the House and Senate.“We’re nervous that these projects could be taken out, and we want to make sure people understand this is a big part of the budget and we want to make sure we help cities and towns advance the work they’ve done,” Sununu said as he prepared to introduce the mayors of Berlin, Lebanon and Claremont, among others.Also on hand were representatives of the university and community college systems, which are also in line for significant one-time funding.“This isn’t pork barrel. These are real needs,” said Sununu.He has stressed repeatedly that the large state budget surplus has created a one-time opportunity to fund much needed projects while not adding to the state’s ongoing expenses.So rather than use the money to increase Medicaid rates or hire more social workers, which would commit the state to additional spending for years to come, Sununu chooses to “spend one-time money on one-time projects.”Those projects include $9 million for state and local dam repair, $8 million to the community college system for industry partnerships and IT investments to improve online learning options, and $9 million to UNH to add various high-demand programs in health care.Keene State University is in line for $9 million and Plymouth State $6 million.Municipal projects include a $1.5 million parking garage project in Laconia, $570,000 for demolition of old state-owned buildings in Lebanon, $300,000 to Berlin for improvements to a main thoroughfare, and $120,000 to Claremont for sidewalk and drainage work, to name a few.There were no public hearings, committees or formal review processes to arrive at these decisions, just the governor travelling around the state, asking for ideas and putting them in his budget.“As the governor traveled the state, stakeholders approached him with funding requests to help revitalize their local communities, and this list of projects reflects that,” said Sununu spokesman Ben Vihstadt.“Local stakeholders from across New Hampshire traveled to Concord today to advocate directly on behalf of projects in their local communities. It is Gov.

It’s an end-run around the capital budget process.”dsolomon@unionleader.com"

Chris Sununu, which allows nonprofit and for-profit partners to submit applications to the State Board of Education to provide out-of-classroom educational opportunities for credit toward a high school diploma.One criticism is that it takes away local control and a student could hypothetically never attend classes at the physical school but still have enough credits to graduate.But Learn Everywhere-certified programs must meet minimum requirements according to the State Board of Education (as do school districts) and the local district still has the sole authority to set requirements for issuing a diploma.Another criticism is that it will undermine existing programs, such as Extended Learning Opportunities, which flow through the school district.In truth, Learn Everywhere is just another option for students to pursue a more expansive and well-rounded education.It will supplement, not eliminate, learning alternatives.Unlike Extended Learning Opportunities, Learn Everywhere programs are pre-approved and the student need not pursue a learning opportunity without knowing if that opportunity will garner high school credit.Democrats want you to think Republicans are the enemies of education and are determined to launch partisan attacks against Gov. Sununu.But the real enemy of education is eliminating educational choice and opportunity — practically a basic tenet of the New Hampshire Democratic Party.PAUL HARPEROssipee"

To think that raising the minimum wage to more than twice the federal level of $7.25, which currently applies to New Hampshire, will do nothing more than enable low-wage earners to afford all the necessities of life, is naïve.The negative impacts will be drastic and widespread.Gov.

In Kentucky, it is estimated that 95,000 people will lose Medicaid coverage if the state’s waiver plan takes effect in July.”Gov. Chris Sununu’s office issued a strong, negative response to the suit.“This is nothing more than a partisan national organization coming in and trying to undo a bipartisan agreement by New Hampshire lawmakers in the best interest of New Hampshire citizens,” said spokesman Benjamin Vihstadt.“We are reviewing the lawsuit, and intervening in this lawsuit is on the table.”The political pot thickened last month when Sununu proposed a two-year state budget that significantly cut state support for New Hampshire Legal Assistance.What remains to be seen is how this lawsuit will complicate attempts of Democratic House and Senate leaders this spring to amend the Medicaid work requirement so that the program can’t end up knocking too many families off health care.There’s little doubt House and Senate Democratic leaders will be able to advance their bills to Sununu’s desk.But this lawsuit will give Sununu an even more convenient reason to respond with a veto and maintain the state shouldn’t make any changes to the program until this litigation is completed."

Sherm Packard, R-Londonderry.“This same group of people have admittedly broken New Hampshire law every day by driving without a license and have admitted to doing so for years. This has nothing whatsoever to do with the safety of our roads. Documents sold on a street corner in Mexico could be used to obtain a New Hampshire driver’s license. We should not be rewarding people who break our laws.”Rep. Casey Conley, D-Dover, pointed out that 10 states and the District of Columbia already have laws like the one being suggested, which could affect an estimated 15,000 illegals in New Hampshire.“A New Hampshire drivers’ license proves only who someone is, where they live and that they are permitted to drive in our state,” he said.“This bill will improve safety, reduce the number of uninsured motorists, and provide the same privacy protections that all other New Hampshire motorists enjoy. Undocumented people who live in our state may have come here at a young age through no fault of their own.”House Minority Leader Richard Hinch, R-Merrimack, said the bill could have serious consequences if it becomes law.“With New Hampshire’s current laws, allowing illegal immigrants to receive a valid Drivers’ License could make it easier for them to participate in several other things, like vote in our elections,” he said.“If this bill becomes law, we may allow thousands of undocumented immigrants to take advantage of other rights and services that should be exclusive to lawful citizens.”A bill to allow residents who identify as neither male nor female to opt for an X as gender identification on the drivers’ license passed in a voice vote.“This bill allows non-binary residents an equal measure of dignity,” said Rep.

Chris Sununu, a two-term Republican, and the all-Democratic congressional delegation celebrated news the Trump administration that New Hampshire would be getting a 50-percent increase in its federal grant to battle the opioid crisis.But they disagreed over how this came to pass.There’s no disputing the news $11.9 million more will come to New Hampshire from the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.This will bring the coming year’s grant total for New Hampshire to just under $33 million.Sununu said he made the case last month with top Trump aides to give New Hampshire more.“Here in New Hampshire, we are taking an innovative approach to tackling the opioid crisis and our federal partners in Washington, D.C., are taking notice. Last month, I sat down with U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and Seema Verma, administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to highlight our state’s early success with the State Opioid Response (SOR) grant and made a strong request for supplemental funding as it becomes available,” Sununu said in a statement.The delegation’s statements about the new money attributed the increase to Congress voting last September to increase anti-opioid grants to the states from $1 billion in 2018 to $1.5 billion this year.“This additional funding is very welcome news and can immediately be put to use providing treatment to Granite Staters who desperately need it,” said Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-NH.“Every life lost to an overdose is a tremendous tragedy and New Hampshire remains one of the states hardest hit by this crisis, which is why I’ve fought to make sure our state is prioritized in the funding process. These resources will help save lives and by continuing to work across the aisle, we can build on the progress we’ve made in this year’s budget process.”Sen. Maggie Hassan said the delegation urged the Trump administration to make more grant money available.“Turning the tide of this deadly fentanyl, heroin, and opioid epidemic requires sustained federal resources to support those on the front lines of this crisis, and this additional $12 million to bolster treatment services in New Hampshire is an important step forward,” said Hassan. “I am encouraged that the Trump Administration heeded our calls for additional funding, but the greatest mistake anyone could make is to think that this fight is anywhere near over.”Sununu failed to mention the work of the delegation and the delegation didn’t mention Sununu in playing any role in this dramatic increase in federal dollars to deal with the crisis.Last week, Sununu said he was not ruling out a possible campaign for the U.S. Senate in 2020 for the seat Shaheen now holds.Former NH House Speaker Bill O’Brien of Nashua and 2018 GOP nominee for the 1st Congressional District seat Eddie Edwards are also considering a Senate bid.Shaheen has already announced she’ll seek a third term next year.klandrigan@unionleader.com,"

Chris Sununu, who has proposed a very different paid family medical leave plan of his own in cooperation with Vermont.The bill, SB 1, passed the Senate along party lines in February. It’s the first Senate bill to be acted on by the House, and is a major policy priority for Democrats.Sununu’s Democratic opponent in the gubernatorial race last fall, former state Sen. Molly Kelly, blamed Sununu for the demise of a bill that had bipartisan support in the House last year, and made it a major campaign issue.SB 1 sets up an insurance program that would provide 60 percent of wages for up to 12 weeks of qualified leave annually, funded by 0.05 percent universal withholding from paychecks. Individuals could not opt out of the program, but their employers could if they offered a similar benefit independently.Manny Espitia, D-Nashua, told of how his parents could not be at his side during a major health crisis in his youth because they could not get time off work.“There are times when people need to decide whether to choose their job or a loved one, and that is a decision no one should have to make,” he said. “Paid family and medical leave is a moral issue. It’s an opportunity to be with a family member when they are at their most vulnerable. We need to stand with the working people of New Hampshire and offer them protection when they need it most.”Republicans, including Sununu, describe the bill as an income tax because of the mandatory deduction from paychecks.They are also highly critical of a provision in the bill that allows the Commissioner of Employment Security the power to raise premiums to ensure the solvency of the fund.They favor a plan announced by Sununu to create a voluntary plan in cooperation with Vermont, in which state employees from both states would create a risk pool large enough to attract private insurers at rates that would appeal to non-government workers who want the coverage.Senate Minority Leader Jeb Bradley, R-Wolfeboro, said that plan could actually pass and be signed into law.“The only impediment to the state having a paid family and medical leave plan is the mandatory requirement on businesses funded by an income tax that was proposed in the Senate plan,” he said.“It is my hope that the governor vetoes SB 1 so that we can come to a bipartisan compromise that will deliver an opt-in paid family and medical leave insurance plan to Granite Staters who need it, without an income tax.”Critics of the plan Sununu has developed with Vermont Gov. Phil Scott believe it will lead to a risky and costly pool of people to insure because only workers who plan to claim the benefit would opt in.Earlier this month, seven companies responded to the governors’ request for information about the proposal, called the Twin State Voluntary Leave plan.The companies were happy that the governor’s proposal calls for a third-party administrator, rather than a state-run program. But several of the responses suggested that an insurance program based on voluntary participation would be more costly to participants.In its response, Sun Life Financial wrote that the “inclusion of the employee-level choice of whether or not to participate in the program could pose a challenge for insurers.”The Hartford Financial Services estimated that the governors’ Twin-State plan would require premiums equivalent to a 0.8 to 1.2 percent payroll tax for any employer or worker opting in, compared to the 0.05 percent for the Senate plan.In April of last year, the Senate voted along party lines to shelve a paid family leave proposal that had passed the Republican-led House three times, after Sununu indicated he would not sign the bill.dsolomon@unionleader.com"

Ted Cruz, R-Texas, O’Rourke understood one way to compete in a red-state race against an entrenched incumbent was to outwork him.So, like he did in beating an incumbent to first win a congressional seat, O’Rourke made a point of visiting every county right out of the gate in the Senate race; he repeated the approach here, 10 stops in all 10 NH counties over three days.And O’Rourke used his first morning campaigning here to announce he had raised in a 24-hour period a record $6.1 million from 126,000 individual donors, which comes out to an average of $47 a donor.O’Rourke edged 2016 New Hampshire primary winner Bernie Sanders’ own performance last month. Sanders had taken in $5.9 million in his first day from 223,000 donors, which was even less per supporter, an average of $27.On many issues in this trip, O’Rourke’s remarks were clearly aimed at trying to stir the most liberal and passionate base in his party from opposing a ban on late-term abortions (“I trust women to make their own decisions about their own bodies”) to the concept of banning the retail sale of some high-powered weapons (“We should not be selling weapons designed for the express purpose of killing people on a battlefield.”)Top Senate Dem’s party coming upSenate Majority Leader Dan Feltes, D-Concord, turns 40 and Montana Gov.

John McCain’s legacy was going to have no repercussions in McCain’s “adopted” state of New Hampshire did you?While in Ohio on Wednesday, Trump tripled down, saying he “gave him the kind of funeral he wanted” and that “I didn’t get a thank you.”Former GOP chairman, Republican National Committee member and McCain campaign traveling companion Steve Duprey had bailed from Facebook on Feb. 1 but came back on St. Patrick’s Day to hit POTUS between the eyes.“President Trump isn’t worthy to carry even John McCain’s Navy cap. In no measure is he the patriot or public servant that John McCain was. Ever.” Duprey posted.NH GOP getting staff boost Republican State ChairmanSteve Stepanek after taking over as party boss wasn’t shy about asking the Republican National Committee and Trump folks for more personnel and they’ve responded.The NH GOP took on one full-time field person two weeks ago, and starting April 1, there will be four others bringing the total state party personnel to seven.”We’re off and running. This is another sign the RNC and this President are committed to New Hampshire and we really appreciate it,” Stepanek said.The RNC will provide some financial help to support the field staff, he added.Pappas goes to bat for first respondersU.S. Rep. Chris Pappas, D-N.H., has crafted bipartisan legislation aimed at protecting firefighters and EMTs from losing or paying more for their life insurance policies because they carry Narcan to help reverse opioid overdoses.Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y. and a GOP leader on homeland security matters, is the lead Republican on this measure as the New Hampshire Legislature debates whether to close this loophole in state insurance law.”The first responders on the front lines of this epidemic don’t deserve to be punished because of the work they do,” Pappas said. “Preventing these dedicated public servants from obtaining life insurance is a great injustice. That is why I’m proud to help introduce the Insurance Fairness for First Responders Act, which prevents first responders who are equipped with Narcan from being taken advantage of by insurance companies.”Some insurers are denying or increasing life insurance premiums for first responders that have these standing orders and this has become a national concern since narcan is used in all 50 states to battle overdoses.Town meeting elections lead to complaintsThe state’s Election Law unit received 61 inquiries to the hotline Attorney General Gordon J. MacDonald’s office set up for Town Meeting events last week.The unit opened four cases that alleged illegal campaign activity and a fifth that contained charges of misconduct by an election official.Routine issues and concerns were quickly taken care of with support from investigators in the field or attorneys on the hotline, the AG’s office said.Will ed lawsuits translate to short-term $$$How will the education funding lawsuits affect the spate of bills before the Legislature this year to increase state aid grants to the hardest-hit towns?Even before ConVal became the first and Monadnock Regional School Districts the second this week to sue, state Democratic leaders were pounding Sununu for proposing no increase within his proposed state budget for education aid grants.Sununu did call in his spending plan for earmarking another $10 million more to cover special education costs at the local level.If past is prologue, lawsuit threats in the past have prompted lawmakers to toss some more money into the education aid pot especially during good economic times.On this topic, however, Senate and House Democrats will have to keep making more education aid grants a priority if they’re going to succeed in convincing Sununu to support it as part of a grand bargain on the budget.If Sununu is true to form, he’ll be more open to increasing education grants with one-time surplus money and not making permanent changes to the education aid formula that he’ll argue could only strait-jacket the state during economic down times.Climate change and maple sugaringU.S. Sen.

Chris Sununu and DOE Commissioner Frank Edelblut, claiming the state has failed to live up to court orders to pay for an adequate public education.Edelblut said last week that he hopes state lawmakers will address the funding issues that prompted the lawsuits.“I hope that through this action, the Legislature can actively engage in constructive dialogue, and we look forward to supporting them in that effort,” Edelblut said.Witte said the state’s solutions to the school funding problems are not enough, including the latest proposed law changes. The proposed changes do nothing to solve the decades-old problems, she said.“Current proposed legislation and (Sununu’s) proposed budget for the next biennium do little to provide permanent, guaranteed adequacy,” she said. “While some communities may see temporary relief, there remains no solution to a longstanding, ongoing problem.”Kimberly Rizzo Saunders, ConVal’s superintendent, said the state’s adequacy grant of $3,636 does not come close to paying for the adequate education the New Hampshire State Supreme Court said is constitutionally mandated under the Claremont lawsuit decision from the 1990s.ConVal pays about $18,000 a year per student in the district that includes Peterborough, Antrim, Bennington, Dublin, Francestown, Greenfield, Hancock, Sharon and Temple.Monadnock’s cost per pupil was at more than $17,000 a year, according to numbers compiled by the DOE.ConVal wants to see the state increase the adequacy grant to more than $10,000 per student per year, according to the lawsuit."

Chris Sununu’s choice for the next state poet laureate has apparently left some people sputtering in blank verse.Webster resident Dan Moran (we love the name) is a poet of some note, but his name was not the one officially recommended by the Poetry Society of New Hampshire. It was not even on the society’s “short list,’’ we are told.Such action is unprecedented. Who does this Sununu (a name that belongs in a haiku) think he is? Why, next thing you know, elected officials will be ignoring the approved lists of judicial nominees from bar associations.In fact, the latter has happened, often to good effect.Recommendations are just that, and no more. We wouldn’t suggest the Poetry Society suffers from it, but some established groups have a tendency to become insular. They can suffer from a deficiency known as a “hardening of the categories.”We think New Hampshire will survive, perhaps even prosper, with Gov. Sununu’s choice. But we do wonder about one Moran poem, which he read at the governor’s inauguration.He called his poem “New Hampshire.’’ But a fellow named Robert Frost wrote such a poem awhile ago and poet Moran might want to pay heed to a sentence from it:”Just specimens is all New Hampshire has,One each of everything as in a show-case.Which naturally she doesn’t care to sell.”"

House Bill 558 restricts restaurants’ ability to provide plastic single-use straws to customers. House Bill 559 would allow towns to ban single-use plastics.No one wants plastic bags and straws polluting our land and waterways or negatively impacting wildlife. And that’s why many businesses are already taking steps to transition away from single-use plastics, favoring paper and other biodegradable products instead. Many grocery stores have bins available in-store, making it easy for consumers to recycle plastic bags.But those were private business decisions. No one was telling them what to do. It’s not the government’s job to make these decisions for us. These bills, if passed, would result in a patchwork of single-use plastics regulation across the state. This could put businesses in towns with regulation at a disadvantage over neighboring businesses who don’t — either because customers avoid them or because they are forced to shoulder the cost of more expensive alternatives, or both. These bills will have a financial impact on businesses and create some costs for taxpayers just to enforce them.Finally, is this really the work Democrats were sent to Concord to handle?

No Republicans voted for the bill, but seven Democrats voted against it.Republicans argued that friends and family members transferring firearms among themselves would be swept up in the law.“The minority believes there is no problem with illegal gun sales, use or possession in New Hampshire, yet this bill will create a ban on simple transfers of firearms between friends, family and neighbors,” said Rep. John Burt, R-Goffstown. “If enacted into law, this bill will place otherwise law-abiding people at risk of arrest and prosecution.”The bill prohibits any transaction involving a firearm unless a licensed firearms dealer is either the seller or the buyer. If neither party to the sale is a licensed firearms dealer, the parties will have to complete the transaction through a licensed firearms dealer so a background check can be conducted.“By voting to take this action requiring all commercial firearms sales to be accompanied by a background check performed by a licensed firearms dealer, the majority feels this legislation prudently protects public safety without jeopardizing the Second Amendment rights of our citizens,” according to Rep. David Meuse, D-Portsmouth.HB 514, which passed 199-147, calls for a waiting period of seven days to obtain a gun, excluding weekends and legal holidays, prompting critics of the legislation to claim the waiting period could extend as long as 11 days.Voting was largely along party lines, but 12 Democrats voted against the bill. One Republican, John Fothergill of Colebrook, voted for it.“The sponsors have not shown any evidence of criminals obtaining firearms from licensed dealers,” said Burt. “However, this bill will burden licensed dealers with additional record keeping requirements that will force them to increase prices, making it more expensive for law abiding people to exercise their Second Amendment rights.”Opponents of the bill said the waiting period would also put abused women at risk, as they wait to legally purchase a gun for self-protection.Supporter of the bill framed it largely as a way to prevent suicide.“Suicide rates in New Hampshire have risen at an alarming rate of 48 percent between 1999 and 2016,” said Democratic Majority Leader Doug Ley of Jaffrey.“We know that attempting suicide with a firearm is fatal 90 percent of the time and that firearm suicides are cut in half in states that have waiting period legislation.

Chris Sununu.Sununu already has $10 million in new revenue from sports betting in the state budget for 2020-21. In his inaugural address, he called on lawmakers to “Go all in and get it done.”They were more than happy to oblige on a bipartisan basis Tuesday after minimal debate. The bill is now likely to become part of the budget deliberations between House and Senate.It came out of the Ways and Means Committee with a 17-2 vote of “ought to pass.”“The key concern of the minority is that it continues and significantly expands the status quo of state reliance on potentially problematic sources of revenue through sin taxes, instead of taking on the more difficult task of redesigning the state tax structure,” said Rep. Jess Edwards, R- Auburn.“The other large concern is that this bill dramatically increases the level of legal state gambling from approximately $360 million to $560 million.”Edwards predicted the reliance on gambling could become a “well-financed thorn in the side of New Hampshire society.”Arguing for the bill, state Rep. Richard Ames, D-Jaffrey, said the bill was bipartisan “from beginning to end.”“Today, betting on sports events is categorically illegal in New Hampshire, but we all know that many people in New Hampshire and throughout the country are engaging in sports betting notwithstanding,” he said. “The magnitude of this black market is staggering. This bill would bring much of this black market activity to the surface, where it would be legal and regulated.”The Lottery Commission would select 10 locations licensed for sports betting on factors like financial stability, commitment to maximize revenue to the state and commitment to “integrity in gambling,” Ames said.The bill requires local approval for betting locations, in addition to Lottery Commission licensing, with no more than 10 operations at any one time. Certain forms of small-bet sports gambling will be integrated into the lottery system.Betting on high school and college teams is prohibited and all online wagers will have to be initiated and received within state boundaries to ensure compliance with the federal wire act.A Commission on Problem Gambling will be created in the hope of addressing some of the concerns about gambling addiction raised by the bill’s opponents.“Let’s bring black market sports betting out of the shadows and into a place where help can be provided where needed, to show at last we are going to get serious about this affliction,” said Ames.dsolomon@unionleader.com."

Students from Berlin showed up with white T-shirts emblazoned with “Save our Schools.” Those representing the developmentally disabled community were sporting light pink.People living with developmental disabilities came to testify on their own behalf, some in wheelchairs, urging lawmakers to increase the hourly rates for home health aides whose services are essential in their day-to-day life.From his wheelchair, Galen Spiegler of Keene used a speech-generating device to make his point that the home care aides who help him with daily necessities are becoming harder to find and harder to retain, given the state’s low rate of Medicaid reimbursement. He received a standing ovation in the packed hall.“The current low reimbursement rate presents a real challenge to recruiting and retaining a qualified workforce,” said Dr. L. Eric Schlepphorst, chairman of the board of Granite State Independent Living. “It truly is a crisis; unfortunately it’s a silent crisis, and we want to make it known.”He called on lawmakers to dedicate all of the governor’s 2.5 percent increase in funding for community independent living programs to be dedicated to reimbursement rates, along with other increases contained in bills working their way through the Legislature.Legal assistanceSupporters of New Hampshire Legal Assistance, which provides legal services to low-income households, also turned out in force to protest cuts in the NHLA budget by Gov. Chris Sununu, who has proposed a cut from $1.2 million a year to $650,000 a year.Barbara Eiermann, 90, of Exeter, a retired school teacher, described how NHLA helped her resolve a legal problem, and urged the Finance Committee to push back on Sununu’s recommendation.“Today at this very hearing, you’ve heard from a mother with a disabled child, schools with handicapped students and college-educated adults who are victims of abuse,” she said. “New Hampshire Legal Assistance has helped all of these people.”A spokesman for the governor’s office said NHLA was given fair consideration among many competing concerns, including nearly $1 million in additional funding to support the state’s public defender program and additional funding for Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASA).“As with any responsible budget, funding increases in certain areas lead to difficult choices on targeted reductions,” said Sununu spokesman Ben Vihstadt.EducationIn addition to legal assistance and Medicaid rates, education funding was a recurring theme.Berlin Superintendent Corinne Cascadden, accompanied by students from the economically challenged North Country community, called on the state to restore funding that has been taken away in recent years.“The city cannot continue to operate its school system without New Hampshire upholding its constitutional responsibility for state aid to education,” she said. “Why aren’t the students of Berlin offered the same rich resources and educational opportunities that students in property-rich communities can afford to provide?Sununu’s budget did not include any increase in the per-pupil base grant the state offers, but various House bills would do so.Mental healthMental health needs were also at the forefront, as one speaker after another urged the state to fully fund the 10-year mental health plan released recently by the Department of Health and Human Services.High on that list is funding for the state’s first Children’s Mobile Crisis Team.

Darlene Gildersleeve of Hopkinton described how her son, 19, avoided hospitalization because one of the state’s adult mobile crisis teams was able to stabilize him during a recent mental health crisis. But his sister, Gildersleeve’s 13-year-old daughter, suffered from repeated out-of-state hospitalization.“If a children’s mobile crisis team could have treated her in our community, she could have stayed in the home and not missed school for more than 62 days,” she said. “The commute to the hospital was exhausting and expensive. Family members were crushed to not have such a sweet and kind daughter and sister home with us.”The House has until April 11 to turn its version of the budget over to the Senate. The House and Senate in conference have until June 27 to complete action on the budget and hand it over to Sununu, who can sign it, veto it or let it become law without his signature.dsolomon@unionleader.com"
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,Nashua Democrats plead for more education funding,"Mar 18, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/education/nashua-democrats-plead-for-more-education-funding/article_31598efa-8b3c-57fe-aa49-18ac8a455331.html,"NASHUA — Democrats gathered in the Gate City on Monday, urging legislators to adopt more education funding to help schools throughout the state.“Because of budget shortages, schools across New Hampshire are struggling to recruit and keep talented teachers — and there are far too many layoffs,” Sen. Cindy Rosenwald said at the We Support Education Rally on Library Hill. “Again, the reality is that schools in New Hampshire are in crisis.”Gov. Chris Sununu has presented a proposed two-year state budget of $13.1 billion, which includes $63 million in surplus funds for school building aid for select school districts.“And while the single biggest expense to local property taxpayers is education, we showed in the last budget that creative management from the state can result in cash investments into local projects, providing property tax relief and funding local liabilities that have gone unsupported for too long,” Sununu said during his budget address last month.Rosenwald agreed that investments are necessary, but maintained that Sununu’s proposed budget takes the state in the wrong direction by essentially flat-funding public education. She said towns are struggling to keep schools open and make payroll — not worrying about renovations and expanded facilities.“Flat-funding hurts our students, our economy and taxpayers. We need to do better,” Rosenwald said during a news conference Monday outside of Mount Pleasant Elementary School.However, Sununu has stressed that his budget focuses on investing in the education of New Hampshire’s children in a variety of new ways, including an increase in tuition and transportation aid of $8.6 million, as well as a 20 percent increase in special education funds.“For nearly 10 years, the state has flat-funded special education in our schools. These reimbursements, which go to local school districts, also help offset local property taxes,” Sununu said earlier. “But today, that changes. We are increasing special education funds nearly 20 percent so that each and every student has access to an education that suits their needs.”Sen. Melanie Levesque said the governor’s proposed education budget does not do enough. She urged Sununu to fund education appropriately and add money where it is needed the most. Senior citizens and other residents are being taxed out of their homes as Nashua is experiencing large property tax increases because of the recent citywide revaluation process, according to Levesque.“Every dollar we put into our public schools is an investment in our children’s future. It is the only opportunity for children to thrive, regardless of where they live or how much parents earn,” she said. “When we take dollars away from public school, it hurts our children and shifts more burden to our taxpayers, many who are barely making it.”Sununu’s education budget also includes a $24 million investment to double the capacity of health care and nursing programs in the state’s university system, and an addition of $32.5 million for a new loan forgiveness program throughout the next two years.State Rep. Laura Telerski said there still are not enough substitute teachers in city schools, which sometimes results in paraprofessionals being pulled from their regular assignments.“This is just one small problem that results from year-after-year of underfunding education, and it’s just the tip of the iceberg,” said Telerski. “… The children of New Hampshire deserve more. It’s time we stop talking about an education that is just adequate and start talking about an education that is excellent.”NashuaNews@unionleader.com"

In fact, there are only seven circumstances under which a defendant can face capital punishment. No one has been executed here since 1939. Currently, there is only one person on death row: Michael Addison, for the vicious 2006 killing of Manchester Police Officer Michael Briggs.Our state uses the death penalty sparingly, reserving the punishment for the most extreme and unthinkable cases, under specified circumstances. In 2011, the Legislature expanded the circumstances under which the death penalty could apply following the 2009 home invasion and brutal killing of a Mont Vernon woman and her daughter.In the past 20 years, a repeal bill has failed every session, and there’s a reason for that: there are some crimes for which life in prison is not enough.It’s easy to be against the death penalty when one lives in a place like New Hampshire, where evil doesn’t manifest often and where, because of the infrequency of horrific violence, good people drop their guard and begin to think that ridding the world of the death penalty is desirable.But as noted above, there is a time and a place for the death penalty.We don’t have a capital punishment problem in the Granite State.

I will be making a motion on Tuesday to stop allowing Safe Stations in Manchester.”“I have no intention of stopping the program,” Manchester Fire Chief Dan Goonan said on Sunday. “It’s helped too many people. I saw the Facebook post. It was as inaccurate as it was sad.”Statistics released March 8 by American Medical Response show that through March 7, the Manchester Safe Station program has been used as an access point by people seeking help with addiction 5,221 times since it launched on May 4, 2016.“Of those, the statistics that just came out show about 2,300 of those people are from Manchester,” said Goonan. “Why would you shut down something that’s helped over 2,000 residents of this city? It makes no sense.”“They walk in, get an Uber ride somewhere they can stay for two or three weeks, and then after they get out they are right back on the streets again,” said Levasseur. “I’m tired of all the cities and towns around New Hampshire dropping them off here. We’ve got to clean up around our city, and that starts with getting rid of the Safe Station.”The Safe Station program transformed the Queen City’s 10 fire stations into intake centers where addicts head for help without fear of being arrested.In a visit to Manchester in March 2018, President Donald Trump told the city’s first responders they are saving lives with Safe Station and “the whole country is talking about it.” He spoke at Manchester’s Central Station, the birthplace of the program.First lady Melania Trump, Mayor Joyce Craig and Gov. Chris Sununu joined the President when the presidential motorcade stopped at Central Fire Station en route to Manchester Community College, where Trump gave a speech detailing his “Initiative to Stop Opioid Abuse.” The stop gave the President a firsthand look at the Safe Station program.“It’s really quite incredible,” said Trump at the time.“New Hampshire was one of the first states to enter into this opioid crisis, but we will be one of the first states to come out of it,” said Sununu at the time. “We need to make sure we’re getting to the kids before the drug dealers are. Anything we can do to provide a model and best practices for the rest of the country, and Safe Station has become the gold standard of access points and access to treatments.”Levasseur said he is unsure of the level of support his motion will receive Tuesday, when the Board of Mayor and Aldermen meet at City Hall at 7:30 p.m.Goonan said people forget the individuals seeking assistance through Safe Station are “human beings looking for help.”“We handle these like walk-in medical calls,” said Goonan. “I am not going to refuse someone medical help for anyone, especially Joe Kelly Levasseur.”pfeely@unionleader.com"

            New Hampshire's Poet Laureates

Paul Scott Mowrer — 1968-1971 




They came north, to thiskingdom of stone and frost,Felling trees the size of shipsto make splinters for shelter.CONCORD — That reflection on the state’s early settlers comes from the first stanza of the poem “New Hampshire” by poet Daniel Thomas Moran of Webster.His reading of the poem brought a literary touch to Gov. Chris Sununu’s second inauguration on Jan. 3, and the governor later nominated Moran to become New Hampshire’s next poet laureate.This would all be business as usual at the State House, if not for the fact that Moran was not the nominee recommended by the Poetry Society of New Hampshire, nor was he on the society’s short list.Members of the society and their sympathizers in the broader literary community have rallied their forces to oppose Moran’s nomination in favor of the Poetry Society’s choice — Jennifer Militello of Goffstown.Poetry Society President Don Kimball says the controversy is not about the person; it’s about the process that’s been in place since the honorary position was created 50 years ago.

“There has been no precedent in which the governor selected a nominee without the recommendation of the Poet Laureate Selection Committee,” according to Kimball. “In two unusual and extenuating cases, historically, there were apparent exceptions, but in fact these were not exceptions at all; in each case the governor requested and honored the traditional input of the committee’s recommendations.”The official state web page for the N.H. Council on the Arts acknowledges the role of the Poetry Society: “Established by the state legislature in 1967, New Hampshire’s Poet Laureate is an honorary five-year position held by an individual who has made outstanding contributions to the field of poetry.“The poet is appointed by the governor, with the advice and consent of the Executive Council, from a list submitted by the Poetry Society of New Hampshire.”Nomination stalledSununu was planning to present Moran’s nomination to the five-member Executive Council on Wednesday. Moran’s name was on the list of nominees routinely provided at the council meetings. But in reading his nominees into the record, Sununu skipped over poet laureate.“Some of the councilors had questions about him, but he’s still on the agenda, and we’ll bring him forward,” said Sununu afterward.“Dan Moran is great. I only met him very recently, but he’s an accomplished poet who has written many, many books on poetry. He’s a young, engaging guy who really has done a lot. I’m not a poetry expert, but I’m a big fan and think he would do the state an immense service being the poet laureate.”While acknowledging the role of the Poetry Society, Sununu said the selection is ultimately up to him.“Nominees come to the governor’s office for a variety of different boards or commissions,” he said.“It’s always the governor’s prerogative, and the governors will take those recommendations but sometimes make their own nominations. In this instance, I was taken with an amazingly accomplished poet. This is not a reflection on who they recommended.”The Poetry Society is not giving up the fight. After the Executive Council meeting, members of the group offered to meet face to face with the governor “to discuss our recommendation and our process, and we hope they take us up on it,” Kimball said.The five-year term of the incumbent, Alice B. Fogel of Acworth, expires March 23. The Poetry Society nomination of Militello has been sitting on Sununu’s desk since Sept. 24.According to the Council on the Arts, there are no specified duties associated with being the poet laureate, other than to serve as “an ambassador for all poets in New Hampshire and heighten the visibility and value of poetry in our state.”In 2013, the Walter Butts’ New Hampshire Poet Laureate Fund was created in memory of the former poet laureate to provide a small annual honorarium.

Both are acclaimedBoth Moran and Militello have been widely published and acclaimed for their work.In his Sept. 24 nomination letter, based on the work of a nine-member selection committee, Kimball writes, “Jennifer, a 22-year New Hampshire resident, is an accomplished poet with a national reputation. A noted educator, she has an impressive publication history, is founder of the New Hampshire Poetry Festival, now in its fourth year, and is highly respected by the New Hampshire poetry community.”Moran was poet laureate of Suffolk County, N.Y., from 2005 to 2007 and is the author of seven collections of poetry. He has read his poetry internationally, at the United Nations and the Library of Congress. He retired in 2013 from his position as clinical assistant professor of general dentistry at Boston University’s Goldman School of Dental Medicine.For now, Sununu is expected to bring Moran’s name forward at the Executive Council meeting on March 27. Chip Noon, a Durham communications consultant who nominated Moran, says he’ll try to be there as a show of support.“I’ve known him for a few years and have been impressed with his work,” Noon said. “I nominated him through the Poetry Society, and thought he was going to be a no-brainer.”dsolomon@unionleader.com"

Sununu is a perfect example of why it’s very unconstitutional to have a governor appoint his own attorney general. In N.Y. state, the AG is elected and independent of the governor’s office, which it must be, because of those pesky concepts of due process and equal protection.There’s only one reason a state has the top cop appointed by the top criminal. (If power corrupts, and it does almost always, then the governor of any state is likely the top criminal of that state. Dem or GOP, makes no difference.) And I believe every adult knows exactly why the top criminal, with the most power to abuse, who is always found to be getting cash payments from lobbyists for big corporations-doing-business-with-the-politician-getting-the-graft-I-mean-donations, wants to choose and control his own watchdog.Sununu can prove he’s not corrupt regarding Inauguration-gate: change the law to make New Hampshire’s AG totally independent, and let us vote this November on N.H.’s top cop.I predict Sununu will decline to obey the law, like when he insists the governor is not a public servant nor is his office a public office, so he doesn’t need to obey public info laws.

Bob Quinn was a by-the-book leader who never shied from long hours or tough calls. After six years in that role, outgoing Safety Commissioner John Barthelmes tapped Quinn to be his deputy at Safety. Now Quinn is the right man at the right time to take on the top role.Likewise, Perry Plummer is a solid choice to be Safety’s number two. Although his background was in the fire service, not law enforcement, Plummer has impressed us with the way in which he has taken on new challenges, particularly as head of the state’s Homeland Security and Emergency Management division.Like Quinn, Plummer is a man unafraid of long hours and hard work, and has the intellect and drive needed to keep abreast of ever-changing public safety threats.Just as important, Quinn and Plummer are down-to-earth New Hampshiremen who aren’t concerned with the fanfare and trappings of office. These are two men who don’t let power go to their heads.Congratulations to Gov. Sununu on two solid choices."

Jeb Bradley, R-Wolfeboro, warned the Senate these changes could slow economic growth for New Hampshire, which has the lowest unemployment and lowest poverty rates in the country.""What we are doing today and what we are doing this session with all these bills (on taxes, regulation etc.) is going to undermine the very strong economy we have. Mark my words,"" Bradley said.The state has been cutting business taxes since 2015, when the business profits tax was 8.5 percent and the business enterprise tax, essentially a payroll tax, was at 0.75 percent.After a series of cuts approved for 2016 and another round in 2018, the BPT stood at 7.9 percent and the BET at 0.65 percent and that's where they will stay until at least 2023 if either Senate bill would become law.If those two reductions were left in place, by 2021, the BPT would be at 7.7 percent and the BET would be at 6.6 percent.Gov.

The Secretary of State’s office would then mail a postcard to the applicant on which he or she can select a party affiliation or decline to register.All 14 Democratic senators voted to move the SMART Act on to the Finance Committee, with the 10 Republicans in opposition.“Implementing the SMART act is another way to register, taking advantage of data we have already and doing so in a secure accurate, and modern manner,” said Sen. Melanie Levesque, D-Nashua, the bill’s sponsor. “It will modernize our voter registration process saving time or money.”While several Republicans spoke in favor of the bill’s intended purpose — registering more voters — they described it as too costly and unnecessary, given New Hampshire’s high rate of voter registration.Using data from the 2016 U.S. Census, Levesque said only 74 percent of voting-age Granite Staters were registered to vote. Sen. Bob Giuda, R-Warren, suggested the Senate would do better to trust Secretary of State Bill Gardner’s data, which he said indicated a 96 percent registration rate.The two sides also disagreed on the eventual cost of the SMART Act, which would take effect in 2021 if passed by the House and signed by Gov. Chris Sununu.Based on her research of other states that have passed similar legislation, Levesque estimated the measure would end up saving the state $140,000 to $1 million per year in the long run by reducing the amount of time town clerks and election supervisors spend registering voters.At the heart of the debate, though, was a larger question: How easy should it be to register to vote in New Hampshire?“This is a motor-voter bill,” said Sen. David Starr, R-Franconia.“I think we ought to require (prospective voters) to go to city hall … and if they can’t bring themselves to do that, we don’t need their vote.”Sixteen states and the District of Columbia have so-called motor-voter laws, under which eligible citizens are automatically registered to vote when they apply for certain identification at their state’s DMV, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.Throughout the debate over the New Hampshire SMART Act, Levesque has said that it is not a motor-voter bill because the DMV would simply be collecting data from residents and sending it to the Secretary of State’s office, which would then handle the final registration steps.But Republicans said the bill would effectively make New Hampshire the 17th motor-voter state.The success of the SMART Act comes as Democrats, who took control of both legislative chambers in the 2018 election, attempt to roll back a number of voter registration bills Republicans passed during the previous session.On March 7, the House voted to repeal HB 1264, which requires residents to change their driver’s license to reflect New Hampshire residency if they register to vote, and SB 3, which changed the procedures for registering to vote within 30 days of an election.tfeathers@unionleader.com"
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,Teen suicide prevention bill clears Senate,"Mar 14, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/politics/state/teen-suicide-prevention-bill-clears-senate/article_5fa5c071-ea86-5cb2-a81e-2f518ca3b569.html,"CONCORD — The state Senate on Thursday defeated a bill on suicide prevention promoted by Gov. Chris Sununu in his inaugural address, opting instead to unanimously pass a more ambitious bill.The Jason Flatt Act, with bills by that name in both House and Senate, requires every teacher, supervisor and administrator in the public schools to receive at least two hours of training in suicide awareness and prevention annually.Senate Bill 282, which passed the Senate and now heads to the House, extends that training to additional personnel, including students and school volunteers, and requires school districts to adopt a coordinated suicide prevention plan.“Training shall occur within the first year for newly hired faculty and staff, and every three years thereafter. The training shall be accomplished within the framework of existing in-service training programs or offered as part of ongoing professional development activities,” according to the bill.Sununu cited youth suicide prevention as a major policy initiative in his inaugural address earlier this year, touting the Jason Flatt Act.Anguished parents and siblings of suicide victims testified in legislative hearings as to why they think the initiative is necessary.SB 282 was endorsed by Connor’s Climb Foundation, American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, NAMI-NH and other groups.“We believe that true success with suicide prevention can only happen if the students have the tools to prevent suicide too. Our foundation has provided suicide education free to over 60 New Hampshire schools, and is committed to putting it in any school that will implement the program,” according to Tara Holmes Ball, board president for Connors Climb, a suicide prevention group.“The Flatt Act is a good start but just a Band-Aid, and you cannot fix a broken bone with a Band-Aid.”SB 282 had bipartisan support in the Senate, with 16 Senate co-sponsors.“I am pleased the Senate Education Committee was able to work together on the two suicide prevention bills and come up with a consensus on the best way to fight against this tragic epidemic,” said Sen. Ruth Ward, R- Stoddard."

Col. Greg d’Arbonne, president of the New Hampshire chapter of the Association of the United States Army.Gov. Chris Sununu is expected to speak and officially proclaim Vietnam War Veterans Day in New Hampshire.U.S. Rep. Chris Pappas, D-N.H., and others are also expected to also speak.About 39,000 New Hampshire veterans — nearly 40 percent of the state’s veteran population — served during the Vietnam era from 1955 to 1975.Coming back during an unpopular war, troops were often greeted with disrespect and hostility on the homefront.Over the past five years, the New Hampshire National Guard has sponsored events around the state to offer a belated “welcome home.”The Veterans Home intends to continue the annual honors.The Veterans Home is located at 139 Winter St. in Tilton."

“A lot of great people here committed to their community and the state of New Hampshire,” said state Senate Majority Leader Dan Feltes, D-Concord, one of this year’s honorees.“I’m just grateful to be a part of it. It’s an honor to be included, and really grateful for everything everyone’s doing. There’s a lot of committed public servants, especially a record number of young Democrats, committed to moving New Hampshire forward and I’m looking forward to continuing to work with them to make sure New Hampshire remains a great place to live, work and raise a family.”“As individuals and as a group, you represent the best of New Hampshire, and its future — people who are passionate about building and about helping others in our communities,” said Senate President Donna Soucy of Manchester, a member of the inaugural 40 Under Forty class in 2002. “When reading the stories of this year’s honorees, it’s impossible not to be inspired.In 2002 the Union Leader recognized the inaugural 40 Under Forty class with words I think still resonate today. ‘You are tied to New Hampshire’s past, and wired into her future. You are the future, and the future is now.’”The 21 men and 19 women chosen for the 18th annual Class of 40 Under Forty, sponsored by Dartmouth-Hitchcock, have made professional and personal contributions to make New Hampshire a better place to live and work.This year’s group features two honorees in their 20s; 13 between 30 and 35; and 25 between 36 to 39.This year’s group brings the total number of Granite Staters honored to 720 since the program began.The 2019 class represents a diverse workforce, including three first responders, a former police officer now helping young adults make healthy choices, and a Latin teacher who also coordinates security and crisis management.Three more honorees work as advocates for children in need and those battling substance abuse. The class also includes six lawyers, six medical professionals, four honorees from politics and four educators. Other industries represented include finance, marketing, construction, culinary arts and weather.Close to 250 nomination forms were received from across the state in the fall.“They are all passionate advocates for our way of life in the Granite State,” said New Hampshire Union Leader Executive Editor Trent Spiner. “Tonight you join a very select group including CEOs, fire chiefs, doctors and volunteers.”“It’s very exciting, I love what I’m doing right now in terms of working at the state and running a business and being very active in the community,” said state Rep. Erika Connors of Manchester, a former city school board member. “It’s an honor to be selected and be among this great group of people. I hope to live up to the group, and there are some amazing people here who have done great things for New Hampshire and beyond, and I hope to as well.”“It’s really humbling,” said state Rep. Matt Wilhelm of Manchester. “I would always pay attention to who was on that list, and it’s an honor to be chosen, and be a part of the legacy of 40 Under Forty.”“It was a complete surprise and an honor to be recognized with everyone else here tonight,” said Bow Fire Chief Mitchell Harrington. “There are an awful lot of folks here at the top of their profession.”“It’s a pretty cool honor, but doing this and doing any job is easy when you have found something you are passionate about,” said Joseph Stalker of Concord, an EMS captain with the Hooksett Fire Department. “It makes it easy to do what we do when you love your job. It’s nice to be recognized once in a while.”Nominees had to be under 40 as of Feb. 1, have lived in the state for at least three years, and have made professional and personal contributions to making New Hampshire a better place."
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,'Cherry Frost' .22 rifle raffle called a threat to Rep. Sherry Frost,"Mar 13, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/politics/state/cherry-frost-rifle-raffle-called-a-threat-to-rep-sherry/article_7b3b4b8e-4628-5cde-92e9-4ac90277c43d.html,"CONCORD — A poster to promote the raffle of a 22-caliber rifle called the Cherry Frost has Legislative Protective Services investigating the matter as a possible threat to state Rep. Sherry Frost, a vocal Democrat on gun control and other issues that have garnered national attention.The Speaker of the House says the Department of Administrative Services is looking into whether the firearms raffle violated the terms of the permit for use of the State House grounds.“The permit came from Department of Administrative Services, so it’s up to them, but in their boiler plate permit it states you cannot sell anything, and I suppose selling raffle tickets would be a violation of standard licensing,” said Shurtleff.The controversy began with an event in front of the State House on Saturday to protest gun control legislation put forward by the Democratic majority in the state Legislature.The Women’s Defense League of NH was holding its fifth annual Gun Rally with the theme “Hold the Line.” Former state senator Bob Clegg, now a lobbyist and president of ProGun NH, addressed the crowd.Clegg also posted a picture of the gun painted white with red cherries on it, and the poster promoting raffle tickets on Facebook, with the line “One of a kind.”Facebook has since taken the post down, according to Clegg, saying he was told it was “inappropriate content for the community, because it had a gun in the picture.”Clegg maintains the name of the firearm and his Facebook post have nothing to do with the high-profile Democrat from Dover.“Everything is not about her,” said Clegg on Wednesday. “There is cherry frost lipstick, cherry frost vodka, cherry frost slushies at 7/11. They are just looking to create a thing.”Clegg said the gun was painted to make it more appealing to raffle ticket buyers.“The new thing now is to paint guns whatever color you want,” said Clegg. “The whole thing is to dress the firearm up as a one-of-a-kind 22.”Money raised by the raffle will be used to pay prizes in an essay contest for students about the Bill of Rights, said Clegg. “This is a sad attempt by the red flag people to silence the opposition,” he said.Both sides in the gun law debate claim to have received threatening emails and social media content from the other side.The investigation by protective services was initiated on a complaint from Rep. Timothy Horrigan, D-Durham.Frost says she’s already been in contact with protective services and has herself contacted the FBI.“My first instinct was that it felt very middle school. The difference in the name of the gun and my name is one letter. Do adults really think this is a coincidence?” she said in an interview on Wednesday.She alluded to near-fatal attacks on lawmakers in recent years as a good reason to be concerned.“In the age of Gabby Gifford and Steve Scalise, and the man who was just arrested a couple weeks ago with an arsenal and a hit list that included lawmakers, public officials are literally as well as figuratively targets, and I think in this environment it is not unreasonable to assume that if someone is naming a gun after me they are making a pretty clear statement about what they want.”When asked why she thinks she would be targeted, Frost said, “Because I’m outspoken. Because I draw attention to these issues.”The website, govpredict.com “where data meets politics” in November gave Frost the award for “pottiest mouth politician.”“Sherry Frost, a state legislator from New Hampshire has cursed an amazing 415 times since 2017 (353 if you don’t count “d*mn”). She has posted an original Tweet with a curse word 331 times and retweeted 84 potty mouthed posts. Her favorite curse word is sh**, which she has used 119 times, with *rick (91 times) and f(***) close behind,” the site posted.In 2017 she had to defend herself in a legislative inquiry prompted by comments she made on Twitter that men telling her to calm down make her homicidal and that white, Christian men are a terrorist problem.Her case was lumped in with an inquiry into Republican Rep. Robert Fisher of Laconia, who at the time was exposed as the creator of a misogynistic online forum.The social media explosion over the Cherry Frost firearms raffle comes amid increasing tensions between gun control and gun rights advocates at the State House as several gun control measures are up for a vote, most of which are likely to be vetoed by Republican Gov.

Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,Obama officials failed to focus as fentanyl burned its way across America,"Mar 13, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/politics/national/obama-officials-failed-to-focus-as-fentanyl-burned-its-way/article_db7c6060-da4d-5c45-84d1-d1faa7425c20.html,"In May 2016, a group of national health experts issued an urgent plea in a private letter to high-level officials in the Obama administration. Thousands of people were dying from overdoses of fentanyl — the deadliest drug to ever hit U.S. streets — and the administration needed to take immediate action. The epidemic had been escalating for three years.The 11 experts pressed the officials to declare fentanyl a national “public health emergency” that would put a laserlike focus on combating the emerging epidemic and warn the country about the threat, according to a copy of the letter.“The fentanyl crisis represents an extraordinary public health challenge — and requires an extraordinary public health response,” the experts wrote to six administration officials, including the nation’s “drug czar” and the chief of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The administration considered the request but did not act on it.

The decision was one in a series of missed opportunities, oversights and half-measures by federal officials who failed to grasp how quickly fentanyl was creating another — and far more fatal — wave of the opioid epidemic.In the span of a few short years, fentanyl, a synthetic painkiller 50 times more powerful than heroin, became the drug scourge of our time. Fentanyl has played a key role in reducing the overall life expectancy for Americans.If current trends continue, the annual death toll from fentanyl will soon approach those from guns or traffic accidents. Among the dead are the anonymous and the famous, including musicians Prince and Tom Petty. It is so powerful that just a few flecks the size of grains of salt can cause rapid death.Between 2013 and 2017, more than 67,000 people died of synthetic-opioid-related overdoses — exceeding the number of U.S. military personnel killed during the Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan wars combined. The number of deaths, the vast majority from fentanyl, has risen sharply each year. In 2017, synthetic opioids were to blame for 28,869 out of the overall 47,600 opioid overdoses, a 46.4 percent increase over the previous year, when fentanyl became the leading cause of overdose deaths in America for the first time.“This is a massive institutional failure, and I don’t think people have come to grips with it,” said John Walters, chief of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy between 2001 and 2009. “This is like an absurd bad dream and we don’t know how to intervene or how to save lives.”Federal officials saw fentanyl as an appendage to the overall opioid crisis rather than a unique threat that required its own targeted strategy. As law enforcement began cracking down in 2005 on prescription opioids such as OxyContin and Vicodin, addicts turned to heroin, which was cheaper and more available. Then, in 2013, fentanyl arrived, and overdoses and deaths soared.“Fentanyl was killing people like we’d never seen before,” said Derek Maltz, the former agent in charge of the Drug Enforcement Administration’s Special Operations Division in Washington. “A red light was going off, ding, ding, ding. This is something brand new. What the hell is going on? We needed a serious sense of urgency.”But for years, Congress didn’t provide significant funding to combat fentanyl or the larger opioid epidemic. U.S. Customs and Border Protection didn’t have enough officers, properly trained dogs or sophisticated equipment to curb illegal fentanyl shipments entering the country from China and Mexico. The U.S. Postal Service didn’t require electronic monitoring of international packages, making it difficult to detect parcels containing fentanyl ordered over the internet from China. CDC data documenting fentanyl overdoses lagged events on the ground by as much as a year, obscuring the real-time picture of what was happening.Facing hotly contested midterm elections in 2018, Congress finally passed legislation aimed at addressing the increasingly politicized opioid crisis, including a measure to force the Postal Service to start tracking international packages.“How many people had to die before Congress stood up and did the right thing with regard to telling our own Post Office you have to provide better screening?” Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, sponsor of the legislation, asked on the Senate floor last fall.Local and state leaders in hard-hit communities say the federal government wasted too much time at a cost of far too many lives.“Everybody was slow to recognize the severity of the problem, even though a lot of the warning signs were there,” said Republican Gov. Chris Sununu of New Hampshire, which has one of the highest fentanyl overdose rates in the United States.Narcan, which delivers an opioid-overdose antidote, has become standard issue for some New Hampshire school districts. Addicts overdose on the sidewalks and in public parks of Manchester and are found slumped over the steering wheels of cars in traffic. Firefighters and paramedics are called nearly every day to fentanyl overdoses and have opened their station houses to addicts seeking treatment.“In the city of Manchester, we saw 20 overdoses to 80 overdoses a month. We were like, ‘What the heck is happening with these overdoses?’ “ said Manchester Fire Chief Dan Goonan.He said politicians and policymakers held numerous roundtable discussions to talk about solutions, but there was little action.“I said, ‘If I had to go to another roundtable, I’m going to jump out the window myself because we’re going nowhere with these roundtables,’ “ he said.

Drug treatment experts compared the government’s slow response to an earlier failure to face the AIDS epidemic.“There was a stigma about being gay,” said Luke Nasta, executive director of the largest drug treatment facility on Staten Island, New York. “There is also a stigma about being addicted to drugs. The entire society is suffering and the government can’t seem to get their arms around this epidemic.“If it’s an epidemic, then treat it like an epidemic.”.The first wave of the opioid epidemic began in 1996 after drug manufacturer Purdue Pharma introduced what it claimed to be a wonder drug for pain — OxyContin, a powerful opioid that was aggressively marketed to physicians as less addictive than other prescription narcotics. As the medical community embraced the new drug, it became a blockbuster for Purdue, generating billions in sales.Over the next decade, doctors and corrupt pain management clinics prescribed massive amounts of opioids. To meet the demand, drug manufacturers and distributors flooded communities across the country with opioid pills, including oxycodone and hydrocodone. Drug users and dealers diverted hundreds of millions of doses to the streets.The DEA started to crack down on the illegal trade in 2005. Two years later, Purdue paid $600 million in fines and its executives pleaded guilty to federal criminal charges for claiming the product was less addictive than other painkillers. The company agreed to make its marketing conform to federal rules and has launched programs to combat opioid abuse.“It is deeply flawed to suggest that activities that last occurred 18 years ago are responsible for today’s complex and multi-faceted opioid addiction crisis,” the company said in a recent statement.The federal government also fined the largest drug distributors and pharmacies tens of millions of dollars over allegations that they failed to report suspicious orders of pain pills.As the supply of prescription opioids began to tighten, America’s pill addicts became desperate. Street prices soared. Mexican drug cartels saw an opening to sell more heroin, a cheaper, more potent way to get high. That set off the second wave of the epidemic by 2010 and a rise in overdose deaths.Then fentanyl hit the streets. A synthetic opioid developed in 1960 by a Belgian physician, fentanyl is normally reserved for surgery and cancer patients. It is up to 100 times more powerful than morphine, its chemical cousin.For traffickers, illicit fentanyl produced in labs was the most lucrative opportunity yet, a chance to bypass the unpredictability of the poppy fields that produced their heroin. The traffickers could order one of the cheapest and most powerful opioids on the planet directly from Chinese labs over the internet.It was 20 times more profitable than heroin by weight. By lacing a little of the white powdery drug into their heroin, the dealers could make their product more potent and more compelling to users. They called it China White, China Girl, Apache, Dance Fever, Goodfella, Murder 8 or Tango & Cash.The third wave of the opioid epidemic was about to begin. Ground zero was Rhode Island, already reeling from a crippling prescription pill and heroin problem.

The first signs were detected in the spring of 2013 when overdose deaths spiked at the state morgue in Providence. Then-Rhode Island Health Director Michael Fine wondered: What was killing so many so quickly?Fine was surprised to learn when the toxicology reports came back that 12 people who overdosed between March and May had died from fentanyl. They ranged in age from 19 to 57, and most were from the northern part of the state.Fine notified the CDC about the cluster. On Aug. 30, 2013, the CDC in its Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report highlighted the unusual spike in Rhode Island. It didn’t attract much national attention.Eighteen days before the CDC issued its “Notes from the Field,” then-Attorney General Eric Holder traveled to the other side of the country to issue one of the biggest policy proclamations of his career.Standing before hundreds of lawyers gathered for the American Bar Association’s annual conference in San Francisco, Holder announced that he was rolling back the aggressive prosecution strategy that had been launched to target the crack cocaine crisis of the 1980s and 1990s.Calling the new policy “Smart on Crime,” Holder said he was directing federal prosecutors to stop bringing low-level, nonviolent drug charges that would trigger mandatory-minimum sentences. The charges had resulted in harsh sentences for first-time offenders, many of them young black men. Holder told his prosecutors to focus on large drug-trafficking organizations.He wanted a major reduction in the burgeoning federal prison population, but his initiative also was part of the Obama administration’s strategy to favor drug treatment over incarceration.“Our system is, in too many ways, broken,” Holder said that day. “A vicious cycle of poverty, criminality and incarceration traps too many Americans and weakens too many communities.”Prison reform activists, civil rights groups and some federal prosecutors hailed the new policy, laid out in a three-page Department of Justice memorandum that became known as the “Holder Memo.”

In 2017, the state had a synthetic-opioid-overdose death rate of approximately 28 per 100,000 people, with Maryland, Massachusetts and Washington, D.C., not far behind. Only West Virginia and Ohio had higher rates.

.Tim Pifer and his team at the state crime lab in Concord started to see the same pattern in 2014 that Fine had noticed in Rhode Island the previous year.“We were thinking, why would anyone inject something that’s so potentially deadly?” Pifer, the veteran chief of the lab, said in a recent interview. “We saw this huge spike in drug deaths.”To get the word out, state health and law enforcement officials in New Hampshire and Rhode Island joined with the DEA, which had been seeing the same pattern across New England.In January 2014, the DEA issued a bulletin warning local authorities nationwide about “killer heroin” cut with fentanyl. First responders needed to “exercise extreme caution” because fentanyl could be absorbed through the skin. The bulletin resulted in a few local news stories. But, once again, there was little national attention.

In March, a month after actor Philip Seymour Hoffman’s heroin overdose generated national headlines, Holder released a video to notify the public of the rising number of heroin deaths across the country. He called heroin an “urgent and growing public health crisis.” Between 2006 and 2010, heroin overdose deaths had increased by 45 percent.“Confronting this crisis will require a combination of enforcement and treatment,” Holder said in the video. “The Justice Department is committed to both.”Holder made no mention of fentanyl; top officials in Washington were still focused on heroin and prescription pain pills.Former DEA agents said they provided Holder with a personal briefing that included a 30-slide PowerPoint presentation about the dangers of fentanyl in June 2014, three months after Holder’s video. Several DEA officials were present, including then-DEA administrator Michele Leonhart.The PowerPoint warned that heroin was being laced with fentanyl and there had been an “outbreak” of fentanyl overdoses in the Northeast. It also noted that the drug was being ordered over the internet. The agency had traced the source to Chinese drug-trafficking organizations.While raising red flags, the PowerPoint presentation itself did not request any particular action.“We were hoping and expecting a briefing to the nation’s number one law enforcement official would not only raise the level of awareness, but would cause him to take action within the department to direct people to make this matter a high priority since people were dying,” Maltz, the DEA’s former agent in charge of the Special Operations Division, later said.Maltz’s division prepared and delivered the PowerPoint. He said he and his agents believed that a national problem like fentanyl was “way bigger than the DEA,” and the attorney general could have taken a leadership role, urging other agencies to focus on the emerging threat.Leonhart did not respond to requests for comment. Holder declined an interview request. His former spokesman said it was up to the DEA to ask the attorney general for specific action.“It says something that the people pointing fingers at the attorney general can’t point to a single action they recommended that he declined to take,” said Matthew Miller, Holder’s former spokesman at DOJ. “Eric Holder made fighting the opioid crisis a major focus, he strongly supported the DEA’s work in this area, and if the officials trying to now lay the blame at someone else’s feet had asked for more assistance, he would have given it, as he did in nearly every instance a law enforcement agency made such a request.”Ten months after the briefing, Holder left the administration.By then, fentanyl was spreading across the country. Large increases in fentanyl seizures were being reported in Massachusetts, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Florida, Kentucky, Maryland and Virginia.At the same time, in the wake of Holder’s memo, federal drug cases were dropping. In a year, the number of people charged with federal drug crimes fell by more than 4,700 — from 27,106 in 2013 to 22,387 in 2014.“There was a dramatic decline in drug prosecutions,” Rod Rosenstein, who served as the U.S. attorney in Baltimore during the Obama administration and is now the deputy attorney general, recently told The Post. “That was a reflection of administration policy to de-emphasize imprisonment and to shift focus away from prosecution into treatment.”Then-Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates said in 2016 that U.S. Sentencing Commission data showed that the number of serious drug prosecutions — such as those involving firearms — increased.But a report by Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz found that the sentencing data Yates used had “significant limitations” because it did not count the number of cases from drug agents that assistant U.S. attorneys turned down for prosecution. Horowitz concluded that there was no way to gauge the precise impact Holder’s memo had on drug prosecutions.Holder’s former spokesman said the memo did not take away tools from prosecutors.“It gave them discretion,” Miller said in a written statement. “They have the same ability to charge cases they have always had, they are just supposed to use discretion and not automatically trigger mandatory minimums when they aren’t appropriate. There are many reasons for the increase in fentanyl abuse, but there is no evidence that the Smart on Crime initiative is one of them.”But out in the field, some drug agents and prosecutors said they noticed an immediate difference, just as fentanyl started to show up on the streets.Dominick Capuano, a former veteran New York City narcotics supervisor who worked with federal task forces on Staten Island, said his agents traditionally launched their cases by arresting low-level dealers. Prosecutors would then offer plea deals for information about bigger traffickers. Law enforcement would work its way up to the kingpins. Federal laws carry long prison sentences and provide powerful incentives for people to talk.After the Holder memo, Capuano said federal prosecutors would no longer take the lower-level cases and morale among his drug agents plummeted as heroin and fentanyl overdoses soared.“The low-lying fish is where you start the cases,” said Capuano, who recently retired after 21 years on the job. “Those are the people who flip, who give information, and that’s what leads to these bigger cases.”Utah U.S. Attorney John Huber, an Obama appointee who was renamed to the position by the Trump administration, said in a recent interview that the change in policy “took the edge off” drug prosecutions.The message, he said: “This isn’t so important anymore.”.On March 18, 2015, nine months after its presentation to Holder, the DEA put out its strongest warning yet to law enforcement agencies and the public about the mounting threat, issuing a “Nationwide Alert on Fentanyl.”The alert was a distillation of what the agency had learned about the drug in the previous two years. It was intended to sound the alarm, not only to the agency’s field offices, but also to federal and state officials, and to the public. The DEA warned that fentanyl was increasingly showing up in heroin.DEA agents said fentanyl was being ordered by traffickers and users over the internet and the dark web. They paid for the drug with bitcoin and other forms of cryptocurrency. The agency noted that Mexican cartels were smuggling fentanyl through ports of entry along the Southwest border, hiding it in wheel wells and secret compartments in cars and trucks.State and local labs reported that seizures had risen from 942 in 2013 to 3,344 in 2014.The rise in deaths was disturbing: 80 fentanyl deaths in the first six months of 2014 in New Jersey and 200 deaths in Pennsylvania over 15 months.The same month that the DEA issued its alert, Congress directed the Justice Department and the White House drug czar to convene a National Heroin Task Force to develop strategies to confront the “heroin problem” and “curtail the escalating overdose epidemic and death rates.”This was meant to be the administration’s big effort, bringing together 25 agencies to develop a “comprehensive” national response to the crisis.The focus was still on heroin and prescription pills.The task force’s 23-page report was delivered to Congress by the new attorney general, Loretta Lynch. Five sentences were devoted to fentanyl.The report said the surge in opioid deaths “may be related” to a rise in heroin being laced with fentanyl. It called for the creation of response teams to warn police and the public about overdoses, some of which may involve fentanyl, and said there should be more research into “opioid use disorder,” including the use of fentanyl.No mention was made of the role of China and orders of fentanyl over the internet, the smuggling of fentanyl through the U.S. mail or the lack of resources devoted to fighting fentanyl trafficking at the border and ports of entry.“In retrospect, it should have been a focus of the report,” Michael Botticelli, the White House drug czar at the time, said in a recent interview.A task force leader saw fentanyl as an extension of the prescription pill and heroin crisis, not as the beginning of a new and far deadlier drug epidemic.“It was not ignored and it was on the radar and we did talk about it, but it was sort of like another problem on top of everything else,” said David Hickton, former U.S. attorney of the Western District of Pennsylvania, who co-chaired the task force. “The big problem at the time was opioids in pill form. Fentanyl was episodic at that time. It looks so different to me today than it did then. Now, it looks like its own problem. At the time, it looked like a spike problem.”Hickton said he was frustrated that the report didn’t fault Congress for failing to provide funding to fight the epidemic. He said the task force believed that at least $1 billion was needed immediately for law enforcement efforts and treatment programs.“We were very clear about what we needed,” said Hickton, who later created his own state task force to focus on heroin and fentanyl traffickers. “We didn’t get half. We got zero.”At the same time, the state of Rhode Island launched its own task force after newly elected Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo declared opioid overdoses to be a “public health crisis” in 2015.Two experts advising the task force visited the state morgue in Providence. Josiah Rich and Traci Green, epidemiologists from Brown University, pored over the autopsy reports that had so alarmed Michael Fine two years earlier.“There’s a fentanyl, there’s another fentanyl,” Rich recalled in a recent interview.As they sifted through the reports and the photographs of the dead, one stood out: a pregnant woman, slumped over, surrounded by the presents she had recently received for her baby shower.“It hits you in the heart,” Rich said. “You read through a two-foot stack of those and you’re a different person.”Rich and Green began to contact their colleagues around the country and discovered that others had also seen troubling spikes of fentanyl deaths.“We said, ‘Oh my goodness, this fentanyl is really starting to take off,’ “ Rich said. “Nobody’s doing anything about it. Nobody’s saying anything about it.”Lynch, the attorney general, did mention fentanyl in one sentence during a keynote address she delivered at the Opioid Misuse and Addiction Summit in Massachusetts that fall. Lynch said the DEA had recently taken “several major actions” against drug traffickers and was “raising awareness about the growing presence of fentanyl in heroin sold on the streets, which substantially and tragically increases the risk of overdose.”In Washington, Tom Frieden, the CDC chief during the Obama administration, notified several senior administration health officials about the increasing fentanyl overdoses, including a doubling of deaths in New Hampshire in one year.Frieden believed one of his roles was to alert government officials to dangerous trends in the field. In October 2015, the CDC issued a nationwide health advisory about the increasing dangers of fentanyl. It was up to the various agencies to take action, he said.“I felt like I was a bit of a voice in the wilderness,” Frieden recalled in a recent interview. “I didn’t have the sense that people got this as a really serious problem.”













Packets of fentanyl, mostly in powder form, and methamphetamine, which U.S. Customs and Border Protection say they seized from a truck crossing into Arizona from Mexico, is on display during a news conference at the Port of Nogales, Ariz.

One of the people Frieden contacted was Botticelli, the drug czar.“I had many conversations with him, encouraging law enforcement to take rigorous action,” Frieden said. “He assured me they were.”The drug czar’s office depended on overdose data from the CDC. But data from the field was sometimes a year behind, and local coroners and medical examiners were not always testing for fentanyl.“It’s incredibly frustrating when you feel like, given the resources of the United States, that we can’t harness those resources in ways that help us see around the corner,” Botticelli said.He said he pressed for faster overdose reporting from medical examiners. He also worked to increase funding for drug task forces around the country.That same year, Kemp Chester was named the associate director of the National Heroin Coordination Group in Botticelli’s office. Chester said the government was focused on pain pill and heroin overdoses; fentanyl was still seen as an outlier.“There was not an interagency understanding of what this drug is, where it’s coming from and how it’s getting into the country,” Chester recalled.Chuck Rosenberg, the DEA administrator at the time, declined a request for an interview.That November — eight months after the DEA issued its national fentanyl alert — the Obama administration sent its annual National Drug Control Strategy to Congress. The 107-page report devoted one sentence to fentanyl, noting that it was showing up in heroin.“It caught a lot of people by surprise,” said Jon DeLena, the associate special agent in charge of the DEA’s New England Field Division. “People didn’t understand until it was really put in their face. People weren’t paying attention to how rapidly this evolved and they weren’t prepared for it.”.

On March 29, 2016, Sen. Edward Markey, D-Mass., joined President Barack Obama on Air Force One for a trip to Atlanta, where both were scheduled to speak at the National Rx Drug Abuse & Heroin Summit.By then, Markey said, the “fentanyl story was still masked in the prescription drug and heroin epidemic” and he felt like “Paul Revere, warning that even greater danger was coming.” He and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., had requested the previous year that the U.S. surgeon general provide Congress with a report to highlight the seriousness of the overall opioid epidemic.The senator used the rare one-on-one time to tell the President about fentanyl.“I mentioned to him how this was morphing into increasingly a fentanyl epidemic and that’s what was hitting Massachusetts and we were the canaries in a mine shaft,” Markey recalled. “He was very concerned about it.”During Obama’s hour-long appearance as part of a panel, the President discussed pills, heroin and efforts to provide treatment to opioid addicts. He made an oblique reference to fentanyl without mentioning the drug by name.“We are now seeing synthetic opioids that are oftentimes coming in from China through Mexico into the United States,” Obama said. “We’re having to move very aggressively there, as well.”The situation had become so desperate that health experts from around the country banded together to make an impassioned plea to the highest levels of the Obama administration.On May 4, 2016, a month after Obama’s Atlanta appearance, the 11 public health experts wrote to the six administration officials, requesting the emergency declaration. Among the experts were Rich and Green, the two Rhode Island epidemiologists who had seen the devastation firsthand.“What was happening was not enough given the scale of the challenge,” said another of the authors of the letter, Joshua Sharfstein, vice dean at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.In their 14-page letter, the experts pointed out that the fentanyl epidemic appeared “to be intensifying after two years.”It was far more dangerous than an earlier fentanyl outbreak in several states between 2005 and 2007, when nearly 1,000 people died. In that case, quick action had saved lives: The DEA had traced the fentanyl to a clandestine lab in Toluca, Mexico, and shut it down immediately.Now, fentanyl deaths were spreading across the nation. In Maryland, the toll had jumped by more than 800 percent from 2013 to 2015.“Like a light switch turning on,” they wrote, referring to Maryland.Traffickers were now buying pill presses from China and lacing fentanyl into counterfeit pain pills such as Vicodin, Xanax and oxycodone.The experts asked the administration to take several steps to immediately address the crisis.To start, they requested an emergency public health declaration from the Department of Health and Human Services that would sound the alarm. “An emergency declaration would clarify the public health nature of the crisis and bring needed focus to a new threat that is claiming thousands of lives,” the experts wrote.But an administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the matter dismissed the idea of a declaration, saying it would have been “largely symbolic” and required emergency funds from Congress.Sylvia Mathews Burwell was then the HHS secretary who would have had to approve the declaration. She declined an interview request.Two months after the emergency request, Burwell spoke at the National Governors Association’s summer meeting on opioid addiction in Des Moines, Iowa. She said she had put together a “working group” at HHS and asked the audience for help.“I’m sure you all know better than I do, fentanyl is the problem on steroids,” she said. “If you’re seeing things that are working in your states, please let us know.”Botticelli, the drug czar and another recipient of the request, said the Obama administration’s priority was getting more money from Congress for treatment.“Quite honestly, I think our focus at that point was not just to declare a public health emergency, but really to get additional resources out to states,” he said.But many leading voices in the field feel an emergency declaration could have saved lives by shining a bright spotlight that would have galvanized the administration, awakened the public and warned users of the danger they faced.“A great deal would have been done by the White House simply saying we have this horrible danger out there,” said Walters, the earlier drug czar. “We saw more action by the White House over an outbreak of tainted food, giving out news releases telling people what to look for, telling people to protect their friends and family, than you did for fentanyl. It’s a little ridiculous that we don’t use the bully pulpit to at least provide a national warning.”In the summer of 2016, a few months after the fentanyl letter, the Obama administration declared the Zika virus to be a public health emergency and had already requested $1.9 billion from Congress to address it. Two people in the United States died of Zika-related illnesses.At the same time, the DEA warned, counterfeit pain pills laced with fentanyl were posing a “global threat.”That fall, with the Presidential campaign in full swing, the White House proclaimed “Prescription Opioid and Heroin Epidemic Awareness Week.” It had been three years since the CDC issued the first fentanyl warning in its morbidity report.The administration announced several fentanyl initiatives. It would continue to work with China and Mexico to stem the flow into the United States, make the anti-overdose medication naloxone more widely available and give additional money to drug task forces. The administration said it was adding money to accelerate data collection on overdoses.As part of the “awareness week,” Attorney General Lynch traveled to the University of Kentucky, where she highlighted the rise of opioid overdoses and said “more than a third were caused by fentanyl.”Lynch said the Justice Department would fund research into fentanyl, and she directed her prosecutors to focus on “the greatest threats, including but not limited to individuals and institutions responsible for the trafficking of heroin and fentanyl.” A report issued much later highlighted five fentanyl cases federal prosecutors had brought across the country under Lynch.Lynch declined a request for an interview. Obama also declined to be interviewed.Katie Hill, Obama’s communications director, said any story about “our administration’s fentanyl response” should be put in the context of “our comprehensive approach to the opioid crisis,” which included passage of the Affordable Care Act, a push for funding to expand treatment and the updating of guidelines for prescribing opioids.“It’s impossible to divorce fentanyl from the broader opioid use epidemic and how we responded,” Hill said.After the 2016 election, at the urging of Obama, Congress approved nearly $1 billion for opioid treatment programs. Drug policy experts called that figure “a drop in the bucket.”On Nov. 17, the surgeon general released the opioid report Markey and McConnell had requested the previous year. “As the nation struggles with an unprecedented opioid epidemic, this report is a missed opportunity,” Markey said in a statement at the time. “The deaths caused by prescription drug, heroin and fentanyl overdoses are growing exponentially every year, yet this report fails to provide any detailed roadmap for how best to curb opioid addiction.”On Jan. 11, 2017, in the waning days of the administration, Obama delivered his annual National Drug Control Strategy to Congress. Four years after the epidemic began in Rhode Island, the White House called fentanyl a national crisis.The report said fentanyl overdoses and seizures were soaring. Members of the outgoing administration said they had been meeting with Chinese and Mexican officials to stop the flow. The administration was also working to break up drug trafficking rings and trying to improve communication between agencies to fight the spread of heroin and fentanyl.On page 73 of the 76-page report, the drug czar’s office issued one of its strongest statements yet: “The dramatic increase in the availability and use of heroin and fentanyl is a national security, law enforcement, and public health issue, and it has become the highest priority illicit drug threat to the Nation.”There were no news conferences or releases to announce the report’s findings. There were no news stories written about the report. No one in Congress issued public statements or calls for action. Nine days later, Donald Trump was inaugurated as the 45th President and Obama officials stepped down from their posts, leaving the next administration to confront the deadliest drug crisis in American history."
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,"Kevin Landrigan's Granite Status: Sununu takes aim at Shaheen, won't rule out 2020 run","Mar 13, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/politics/granite_status/kevin-landrigan-s-granite-status-sununu-takes-aim-at-shaheen/article_cfb24481-3250-5b59-a518-fa3e68b18deb.html,"Gov. Chris Sununu edged just a baby step closer to a run for the U.S. Senate in 2020 but he sure turned up the heat should a showdown with U.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen come to pass next year.Sununu warned the two-term Shaheen she should be worried about her reelection.“One thing evident in those polls is people want someone other than Jeanne Shaheen,” Sununu told reporters after the Executive Council meeting.“I think the mandate is very clear they want someone other than Jeanne Shaheen and she is very vulnerable and there are a variety of Republicans out there who can beat her in 2020 and that’s why she came out so early.”A pair of independent polls have recently found a Shaheen-Sununu race would be a dead heat right now.After months of insisting he had no interest in going to Washington, the two-term Republican governor said he would “not rule out” a Senate campaign, but had no timetable for making that decision.Sununu’s team had already formed a political action committee to finance his third run for governor next year and the Newfields resident insisted his current job remains his singular focus.“The only Democrats I am focused on defeating right now are those in the Legislature that are trying to impose taxes and regulation and I’m maintaining my 100 percent effort on that,” Sununu said.Democratic Party Chairman Raymond Buckley said it’s Sununu who should worry about his political survival.“Jeanne Shaheen is doing her job for New Hampshire — like fighting to protect funding at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard from President Trump. Sununu ought to have the guts to join the senator in standing up for New Hampshire rather than making phony political predictions,” Buckley said.Conspiracy theorists recall that it was Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan who in early 2015 stepped up her out-of-state travel. She publicly dismissed but refused to rule out a U.S. Senate run against Kelly Ayotte.By the time Hassan confirmed during the early fall that she was running, it had become the worst-kept secret in New Hampshire politics.Meanwhile Sununu’s decision to allow this speculation to persist may only increase the leverage he needs to have with legislative leaders over the next several months.It is worth pointing out Shaheen easily is the most popular right now among the all-Democratic congressional delegation.Shaheen also won reelection over former Sen. Scott Brown in 2014 in a year that was not a good midterm election for Democrats.Merrimack tollbooth debateWith all the massive issues facing the New Hampshire Legislature in this budget-year session, why would the state Senate be fast-tracking a bill dealing with closing a tollbooth off the F.E. Everett Turnpike in Merrimack?It’s all about the District 11 seat now held by Sen. Shannon Chandley, a one-term Democrat from Amherst.Early on, Chandley realized her bill to eliminate the toll at Exit 11 was a non-starter so she amended it to remove the tolls at three turnpike exits in Merrimack once the bonds are paid off in 2024.As my colleague Dave Solomon reported this week, Department of Transportation officials had serious financial concerns with this approach and questioned if it could affect the turnpike system’s bond rating.Given the deference to DOT at the State House by both political parties, Chandley may not be able to achieve anything concrete this year.But the effort is clearly worth it.Lawmakers will be debating a 10-year highway plan next year and she could resurrect the topic at that point.Merrimack is the largest of four towns in Chandley’s district. While she upset incumbent Milford Republican Gary Daniels by more than 1,100 votes last November, she won Merrimack by under 100 votes.State House observers will recall in 2014 it was then-Senate president Peter Bragdon, R-Milford, who pushed through legislation to close the ramp tolls at Exit 12 in Merrimack, helping him fend off any future challenge from Merrimack Republicans.Daniels hasn’t ruled out running again for the seat in 2020; anything Chandley does to show Merrimack voters she’s committed to pushing for more toll relief would only help her.Sununu still with TrumpDespite a nudge from workers at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, Sununu showed no signs of backing off support for President Trump’s emergency declaration to divert federal money to build the border wall.Shipyard workers maintain that four projects spending up to $161 million could be affected by Trump’s moves to take Defense Department and National Guard spending to support the wall project.But Sununu said he remains skeptical any New Hampshire spending could be at risk.“Obviously we don’t want to see funding in any way diverted out of New Hampshire,” Sununu began.Later he added, “We want to make sure those funds aren’t diverted; at the same time I will say the crisis at the border is real, it has a real impact on our state. Congress failed to do its job.”Sununu said opioid trafficking through the southern border fueled New Hampshire’s drug epidemic and he called for Congress to “take up immigration as a whole” and not just the border project.“We sent Congress to do a job; it’s time for them to finally do it,” Sununu added.The U.S. Senate is expected later today to join the House in approving a resolution to oppose the emergency declaration. (For more Granite Status, go to www.unionleader.com.)klandrigan@unionleader.comTrade rep put on spotFor the second time in less than a month, Sen. Hassan used her new perch on the Senate Finance Committee to call a Trump administration official on the carpet.This time it was U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lightizer. The topic was getting China to make the criminalizing of fentanyl part of any final trade agreement between the two countries.Hassan maintained President Trump was backtracking from his assurance this would happen.“Given the level of importance this has for so many, will you commit that any final agreement will include this step which the President has touted as a ‘gamechanger’”? Hassan said.Lightizer answered in part, “And then the question is, do we write it in the trade agreement? And my own preference would be that we do, but whether it’s in the trade agreement or not, the President of the United States views himself as having a commitment and he views it as something that’s gonna happen.”Hassan fired back, “Almost 500 people died in 2017 and in 2016 from overdoses of opioids in my state, most of which came from fentanyl, so I would ask you to identify this as a priority.”High-profile board seatWhen it comes to progressive politics, Manchester Mayor Joyce Craig got an invitation to the big time this week.The Let America Vote organization put Craig on its national advisory board, which includes among its members national Democratic phenom Stacey Adams, Martin Luther King III, actor Bradley Whitford and former Planned Parenthood CEO Cecile Richards.“It is crucial that we continue to fight voter suppression and ensure every eligible citizen has the right to vote,” Craig said.In 2017, Let America Vote devoted plenty of volunteer and staff time to help Craig unseat then-Manchester mayor Ted Gatsas.Legalizing pot debate comes upAs the policy fight heats up at the State House, Americans for Prosperity is hosting a debate next Monday on marijuana legalization in New Hampshire.Former NH House SpeakerBill O’Brien , who is exploring his own GOP Senate run against Shaheen, will moderate this event from 6:30 to 8 p.m. at the Nackey S. Loeb School of Communications in Manchester.The panel of supporters will be ex-state representative Joe Hannon, who served on the marijuana study commission; Matt Simon, New England political director of the Marijuana Policy Project; and Ross Connolly with AFP.The opponents will be Neil Hubacker with Cornerstone NH, Rep. Stephen Pearson, R-Derry and Rep. Pat Abami, R-Stratham, and chairman of the study commission.Josiah Bartlett slams minimum wage hikeThe fiscally conservative Josiah Bartlett Center for Public Policy issued a critical white paper on the eve of today’s votes in the House to raise the minimum wage and the Senate to create a prevailing wage that must be paid on construction projects in the state.The report maintained these moves would result in job losses for the least-skilled workers and raise such costs as day care.”Though these wage mandates are intended to be a forced wealth transfer from businesses to low-income employees, they wind up creating a forced wealth transfer from the lowest-skilled workers to higher-skilled competitors,” the center concluded.All this isn’t likely to dampen support among the Democratically-controlled House and Senate for both bills.Senate President Donna Soucy, D-Manchester, pointed out New Hampshire lacks its own minimum, relies on the federal standard and polls consistently show up to 70 percent of likely voters favor an increase.Sanders’ NH 2020 team new, old facesBernie Sanderssignaled how important he believes winning the first-in-the-nation primary in 2020 is with his choice of top staffers in New Hampshire.Managing the effort will be Joe Caiazzo who just came off the reelection of Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse’s campaign in Rhode Island. Caiazzo had been political director for Sanders in both Rhode Island and Massachusetts during 2016 and in the general served as Hillary Clinton’s state director.Carli Stevenson, a Hampton native, becomes deputy director and communications director and was the deputy spokeswoman for Sanders in New Hampshire in 2016 and went on to work in Minnesota, Ohio and Indiana. Her career of labor organizing also included a stint with the state party and issue campaigns here.Kurt Ehrenberg of Portsmouth will be a senior adviser to Sanders here after having been in 2016 the state political director for the candidate. In 2018 he worked on Mark McKenzie’s Democratic bid for the 1st Congressional District.Bail reform solution still taking shapeSununu is not picking sides or weighing in on details right now, at least between competing versions of legislation to overhaul the 2018 bail reform law.But he urged lawmakers in both bodies to work with prosecutors and “all stakeholders” to ensure the fix this time is a lasting one.”Let’s try to get this thing right so we don’t have to keep going back to this year after year,” Sununu said.The fact a superior court judge was required to hold a bail hearing for accused murderer Justin Moura in Manchester on Tuesday was one example of the need to tweak this statute, but Sununu said there are many others not in the headlines.””I am happy to see some reform is taking shape,” Sununu added.Shaheen gets Irish group’s blessingShaheen was honored last night with a leadership in government and public service award from the Ireland Funds at the group’s 27th gala in Washington.{p class=”TweetTextSize TweetTextSize--normal js-tweet-text tweet-text” lang=”en” xml:lang=”en” data-aria-label-part=”0”}The Irish prime minister was in attendance as Shaheen got one of four awards for her work as the lead Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee dealing with European security.klandrigan@unionleader.com"

By DAMIEN FISHER/Union Leader Correspondent file photo



PETERBOROUGH — The Contoocook Valley School District filed a lawsuit against the state on Wednesday, claiming the state is in violation of a Supreme Court decision on adequate funding.“The ConVal School Board has not taken this step lightly, it is time for the State to fulfill its promise to our children and to bring relief to the local taxpayers,” said ConVal Superintendent Kimberly Rizzo Saunders in a statement released Wednesday.Rich Cahoon, of Antrim, the vice chairman of the ConVal School Board, said the district, like many others in the state, is tired of waiting for New Hampshire’s government to follow the Supreme Court ruling.“We are unwilling to keep waiting,” Cahoon said.In 1997, the New Hampshire Supreme Court ruled in what is known as the Claremont case that the state’s education funding system was unconstitutional and that the state has a constitutional obligation to provide adequate funding to pay for public schools.Claremont and other property-poor towns sued the state because they contended that using property taxes to pay for local education left poor towns with low property values at a near-constant financial disadvantage.Executive Councilor Andru Volinsky, D-Concord, was one of the lead attorneys in the Claremont lawsuit. While he and his Claremont lawsuit compatriots have no involvement with the ConVal lawsuit, he said the state is still failing to adhere to the Claremont decision.“It’s our position that the state’s been out of compliance for 20 years,” he said.The failure to adhere to the school funding ruling has been a bipartisan problem, as it stretches across both Republican and Democratic administrations, Volinsky said.Gov. Chris Sununu said the lawsuit isn’t the way to solve New Hampshire’s funding problems.“As history has shown, the only people who win in these lawsuits are the lawyers and the problem never gets solved,” Sununu said.Sununu said his administration is working to increase local aid, and pointed to increased funding for school building projects and school safety investments.While the state has been providing adequacy grants to districts, Cahoon said that that money is simply not enough. The state is paying $3,636 per pupil in adequacy grants now, and the figure is expected to go up to $3,700 in the coming school year. “Our per-pupil cost is around $18,000,” Cahoon said.Rizzo Saunders said the grants don’t come close to addressing the many public school expenses that are pushed onto local taxpayers, such as transportation, food services, and funding for state and federal education mandates.While the state Legislature is considering some education funding changes, those proposals do not address the real issue, which is the baseline adequacy, Rizzo Saunders said.“The current proposed legislation does little to provide permanent, guaranteed adequacy and while it may provide temporary relief to some communities, it is not a permanent solution to an ongoing problem,” she said."
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,New commissions tackle recommendations in state's 10-year mental health plan,"Mar 13, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/stigma/new-commissions-tackle-recommendations-in-state-s--year-mental/article_22cd10a4-a3b6-5ea3-b27e-2ef86dbd8225.html,"Gov. Chris Sununu is creating new two commissions to improve services for individuals with mental illnesses in the state’s correctional system; and to promote workforce development in mental health fields.Flanked by advocates and clinicians at the Mental Health Center of Greater Manchester (MHCGM) on Tuesday, the governor signed executive orders that address three of the 14 recommendations included in the 10-year mental health plan that the state Department of Health and Human Services released in January.One of those recommendations was the creation of a commission to bring together state and county corrections, the judicial branch, designated receiving facilities, the state hospital and community providers “to address issues that arise when individuals with mental illness end up in the correctional system.”The executive order Sununu signed Tuesday charges his new Advisory Commission on Mental Illness and the Corrections System with looking at how to reduce incarceration and improve services for such individuals, and to support individuals who are transitioning from jail back to their communities. It also is tasked with examining the use of restraints during transport to and from mental health and correctional facilities.The governor also signed an executive order establishing a commission to address the shortage of mental health workers in New Hampshire, and “develop strategies to boost recruitment and retention of a mental health workforce for the state.” The Statewide Oversight Commission on Mental Health Workforce Development will include state officials from DHHS, Business and Economic Affairs, Employment Security, the university and community college systems, as well as lawmakers.Its duties include looking at student loan repayment programs, reviewing licensing regulations, and identifying policies to boost compensation.At the signing ceremony, William Rider, president and CEO of MHCGM, recalled the progress made under another Gov. Sununu, the current governor’s father, John, in the mid-1980s, that led to construction of a new state hospital. And he said, “This is, I think, another very big fork in the road for New Hampshire, and I think we’re taking the right fork in the road and going in the right direction.”Chris Sununu praised the efforts of DHHS to involve stakeholders across New Hampshire in crafting the new 10-year mental health plan. And he said the state’s strong economy offers a chance to act in a bipartisan manner to improve the mental health system long-term.“We’re really at an opportune point here in New Hampshire, where we can take what we’ve talked about to the next level and put into action a lot of the things we’ve hoped and dreamed about,” Sununu said. “The funding is there, the opportunity is there, and that’s where I think the state really needs to step up and make sure we’re taking advantage of that while we can.”The final executive order Sununu signed creates a new Division of Performance Evaluation and Innovation to streamline operations at DHHS. The department is required to create a “work plan” for the new division by July 1, outlining what it will take to fulfill the recommendations in the 10-year plan.DHHS Commissioner Jeffrey Meyers said the move represents “a really big step forward … so that our department and others we work with can really focus on making sure that we deliver services efficiently and effectively, and that we’re streamlining things in a way that will help us use well all of the money we’re getting, both from the state and federal government.”Meyers told the Union Leader he expects to be able to rely on existing personnel and funding to create the new division at DHHS.The product of numerous work groups and a series of listening sessions held around the state last year, the DHHS 10-year plan recommends transforming the state’s mental health system into a “hub and spoke” model, integrated with the new system the state has been building to help those with substance abuse disorders.Under the proposed system, fewer people would need to seek mental health care at hospital emergency departments, waiting for specialty care. Instead, they would have access to regional hubs that help them access services in their local communities.Sununu said it’s critical to create a mental health system that can respond to future, unforeseen needs as they arise. “It’s got to be flexible and dynamic, and we on a government level have to be flexible and responsive to those needs,” he said."
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,Police frustrated by man's release on bail following altercation with officers,"Mar 12, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/crime/police-frustrated-by-man-s-release-on-bail-following-altercation/article_88870549-1534-5136-a54a-020bc64aeaae.html,"GOFFSTOWN — Police are expressing frustration over the release of a repeat criminal offender on $0 bail following an early Tuesday morning altercation with multiple officers.Matthew Gedney, 36, was arrested by local police early Tuesday morning after they said a patrol officer observed him dressed in dark clothing and acting suspiciously in the area of several closed businesses in the Center Park Plaza area at 679 Mast Road.Gedney fled the scene on a bicycle when the officer attempted to make contact with him, police said.Lt. Tom Hammond said at least six officers responded to the scene, formed a perimeter where the suspect was last seen and went yard to yard in the neighborhood of nearby Cross Street, where Gedney was eventually discovered while he was attempting to hide next to an unspecified home.After a brief struggle with police, Gedney was taken into custody and charged with prowling and resisting arrest. While processing Gedney, police determined he had several outstanding misdemeanor and felony warrants in multiple towns.Despite the lengthy list of outstanding warrants, a bail commissioner set a bail amount of zero, with a court date of April 4 in the 9th Circuit District Court, Goffstown.In the wake of Gedney’s release, Goffstown Police Chief Rob Browne had harsh words for the bail reform legislation that allowed Gedney to be released on zero bail, calling the decision to release someone with so many outstanding warrants “a head scratcher.”“What’s next for him?” asked Browne. “Does he use other means of escape or resisting at a later time where other officers from our jurisdiction or another jurisdiction have to deal with him? Where the level of potential interaction becomes escalated to a point where somebody does get hurt?“I do hope that this gets changed and this does get the attention that it needs before somebody gets hurt by somebody that should have been kept in jail that wasn’t kept in jail,” said Browne of the bail reform law. “And I hope that Mr. Gedney does not prove to be the solidifying piece of proof that something needs to change.”The bail reform bill, SB 556, was signed into law last August by Gov. Chris Sununu and it requires judges to consider someone’s financial means when setting bail. It also prohibits the pretrial detention of people simply because they can’t afford bail.Browne is far from the only police chief expressing concerns about the bail reform law, with the New Hampshire Association of Chiefs of Police calling for the Legislature to return to the drawing board and tighten the evidentiary standards for holding an offender.Despite mounting pressure from law enforcement officials to revisit the law, ACLU New Hampshire, which helped draft SB 556, says it’s standing by the legislation as written.“When we passed comprehensive bail reform last year, it ensured that people with limited income and presumed innocent don’t sit in jail pretrial just because they don’t have the money to pay bail,” said ACLU-NH Communication Director Ariana Schecheter."

Chris Sununu on Wednesday will nominate two long-time state officials to the top jobs in the Department of Safety.













ROBERT QUINN


Seabrook’s Bob Quinn, currently serving as assistant commissioner, will be nominated to replace John Barthelmes as commissioner. Barthelmes is retiring after nearly 12 years at the helm of the state agency responsible for state police and a variety of other public safety services.Perry Plummer of Dover, currently serving as Director of Homeland Security and Emergency Management, will be nominated to serve as the next assistant commissioner.Quinn was confirmed by the Executive Council as assistant commissioner of the Department of Safety in 2016.He was appointed director of the New Hampshire State Police in 2010, with the rank of colonel. He oversaw enforcement of criminal, motor vehicle, and other public safety laws, and the regulation of detective agencies and security services.Quinn received his bachelor’s degree in business administration from Merrimack College in 1983. He is also a graduate of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration’s Unit Commander’s Academy and the FBI National Academy. In 2016 he was named DEA/DARE Law Enforcement Executive of the Year.“I am both humbled and proud to have worked under the leadership of Commissioner John Barthelmes, along with the finest men and women in public safety for over 34 years,” he said. “I am committed to ensuring that the Department of Safety continues to work with all partners to ensure that New Hampshire remains as one of the safest states in the Unites States.”Plummer was appointed Director of the Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management by Gov. Maggie Hassan in 2013.He started his public safety career in 1986 as a Dover firefighter and served as a lieutenant, captain, and assistant chief, before being name chief of that department.He was appointed as Director of Fire Standards and Training and Emergency Medical Services in 2011, overseeing the Fire Academy, fire training curriculum and certification, and the Bureau of Emergency Medical Services.As Director of Homeland Security and Emergency Management, Plummer has been responsible for coordinating the state’s response to major disasters as well as planning, training and exercises to ensure readiness at the local and state levels.The nominations will be presented at Wednesday’s Executive Council meeting, with a confirmation vote likely at the March 27 meeting."
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,Sununu proclaims March as Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month,"Mar 11, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/health/sununu-proclaims-march-as-colorectal-cancer-awareness-month/article_f89ba7a9-ba50-5fee-91cf-455d2a097118.html,"When she was 55, Nottingham’s Fiona Wood underwent a routine colonoscopy and was diagnosed with colon cancer.Since then, she has become committed to ensuring that others have the resources they need to prevent, diagnose, and cure a colorectal cancer diagnosis, advocating with the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network on state and local policies to fight cancer.She recently came one step closer to her goal by working with Gov. Chris Sununu to officially proclaim March “Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month” in New Hampshire.The proclamation was issued from the governor’s office shortly before last week’s re-introduction of a federal bill that would eliminate surprise costs for Medicare recipients who receive a colonoscopy.“I owe my life to the colonoscopy that found cancerous polyps even though I had no symptoms. Hearing the diagnosis was a huge shock but eight years later I am alive and healthy,” Wood said in an American Cancer Society news release.“Everyone should have access to colon cancer screening and lifesaving treatment without financial hardship. I am thrilled that Governor Chris Sununu made this proclamation and grateful to ACS CAN for advocating for improved access to colorectal cancer screening in New Hampshire and federally.”Almost all colon cancer begins as a polyp that can be caught early and removed through screening colonoscopy and polypectomy.In May 2018, the American Cancer Society released a new colorectal cancer screening guideline, recommending that adults at average risk for colorectal cancer start regular screening at age 45 to save more lives. The previous recommendation was to start at age 50.The guideline was changed, based in part, on new data showing rates of colorectal cancer are increasing in younger populations. The American Cancer Society (ACS) updated the guideline to help find colorectal cancer early, when treatment and prevention are more likely to be successful. According to the ACS, those with a family history of colorectal cancer should talk to their doctors about starting screening even earlier.The National Colorectal Cancer Roundtable, of which the American Cancer Society is part, announced a new campaign this year — 80 Percent in Every Community. It emphasizes the commitment to reach 80 percent colorectal cancer screening rates nationally to save thousands of lives. The campaign also strives to pass state and federal laws that remove the barriers preventing people from getting colonoscopies and other lifesaving colorectal cancer screenings.“The science is clear,” said Mike Rollo, director of government relations for ACS Cancer Action Network in New Hampshire. “If Americans received regular screenings for colorectal cancer, thousands of deaths could be prevented each year. But, for too many Americans, the screenings either aren’t fully covered by their health insurance or aren’t affordable due to high out-of-pocket costs. It’s critical we work to change this.”In addition to raising awareness of colorectal cancer in New Hampshire, ACS Cancer Action Network urged the state’s congressional delegation to support the federal “Removing Barriers to Colorectal Cancer Screening Act,” which would eliminate cost-sharing for Medicare recipients during a routine screening colonoscopy when a polyp is removed.“We must enact policies that make screenings possible, including increasing access to health care for all Granite Staters and passing legislation that eliminates the risk of a surprise cost associated with routine colonoscopy for Medicare recipients,” said Rollo.In the U.S., colorectal cancer is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in men and in women. It is the second most common cause of cancer deaths among men and women.The American Cancer Society estimates that there will be 101,420 new cases of colon cancer and 44,180 cases of rectal cancer in the U.S. in 2019, and that 51,020 deaths from colorectal cancer will occur in 2019. In New Hampshire, there will be an estimated 590 new cases of colorectal cancer and 200 deaths in 2019.For more information or to find the nearest screening options, go to www.cancer.org/colon or call 1-800-227-2345."
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,Sununu inaugural committee changes its ways,"Mar 11, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/politics/state/sununu-inaugural-committee-changes-its-ways/article_6ed05985-86cf-50cf-b134-c3490d8d5bdb.html,"Gov. Chris Sununu’s inaugural committee raised more than $250,000 after his reelection win last November, much of it coming from lobbying firms and energy companies, according to newly released documents.The amount was significantly less than the $450,000 in donations it received to pay for celebrations of the governor’s 2016 victory, and financial filings submitted to the Secretary of State’s office on Monday also show notable changes in how the committee spent its money this time around.The latest reports offer the first public look at the committee’s receipts and expenditures since the Union Leader reported in December that it had paid out more than $165,000 to Sununu, his family and close advisers after his first election.The news prompted bipartisan legislation that would cap individual donations to a governor’s inaugural committee at $10,000 and require additional explanations of payments of more than $1,000 made to a governor or his immediate family.The bill, SB 105, was originally sponsored by Senate Majority Leader Dan Feltes, D-Concord. It passed the Senate last week with bipartisan support, 22-2, after an amendment from Sen. Regina Birdsell, R-Hampstead.On Monday, Sununu’s office said he would support the legislation.“As our office has long stated, we have been ready and willing to work with the legislature to enact practical and fair updates to the statute,” Ben Vihstadt, a spokesman for Sununu, said in a a statement. “Our office worked with Senator (Regina) Birdsell to amend the legislation so that fair and practical updates to the statute could be implemented. This legislation, with the addition of Senator Birdsell’s amendment, will continue to ensure transparency for current and future inaugural committees and our office supports this bipartisan compromise.”The new financial reports from Sununu’s inaugural committee show that it eliminated or cut back on payments to Sununu’s friends and family members.The committee, which is legally named The Sununu Inaugural Celebration Inc., is a 501c(4) nonprofit organization.After the 2016 election, it paid $50,188 to a company owned by the governor’s sister, Catherine Sununu, and $47,755 to Paul Collins, a close adviser to the governor, among payments to Sununu’s family and inner circle.At the time of the payments, Catherine Sununu was the chair of the committee and Collins was its treasurer, raising questions about whether the payments violated tax laws that prohibit directors of nonprofits from unduly profiting from their organizations.In December, Catherine Sununu said she organized the three inaugural parties held in 2017 on her own and was fairly compensated for it. Collins has declined to provide detailed explanations for the payments he received — or the $39,360 that went directly to Gov. Chris Sununu for what financial reports listed only as “expenses” and “travel” — beyond saying they were legal and furthered the duties of the governor.The new reports show that the inaugural committee did not make any payments to Catherine Sununu during the filing period, which spanned November through February.Instead, it hired a professional event planner, Christopher Molloy, and paid his company Community Events LLC $40,544 to organize the inaugural parties held at the Omni Mount Washington Resort and DoubleTree by Hilton Manchester hotels earlier this year.Asked why the committee decided to hire someone else to organize the parties instead of Catherine Sununu, Collins wrote in an email, “Community Events LLC is a great New Hampshire company and the Inaugural Celebration chose to use their services this year.”Collins himself received two checks worth $1,548 and Chris Sununu received one for $920 for “expenses” during the latest filing period.There were also changes among the committee’s largest donors.Three companies — Eversource, Centene Management Company and the Gallagher, Callahan & Gartrell law firm — contributed $25,000 each for the 2017 inauguration.Like many of the donors to governors’ inaugural committees over the years, the companies had business before state government.Centene has not made any donation to the fund this year, according to the reports. Gallagher, Callahan & Gartrell contributed $8,000.Eversource spokesman William Hinkle said that the company intends to chip in $25,000 again, but due to an internal error, the check has not yet been sent to the committee.Five donors wrote checks worth $10,000 to celebrate Sununu’s reelection — Bank of America; Uber; Unitil, a gas and electricity utility; Pfizer, a drug manufacturer; and RAI Services Company, a tobacco company.Energy companies, including Unitil, contributed a combined $37,000 to the committee, while lobbying firms, like Gallagher, Callahan & Gartrell, contributed at least $42,300.The committee spent $228,578 on the 2019 inaugural parties and other expenses during the latest filing period and has a remaining balance of $67,289."

Caswell said the state has seen significant growth in aerospace and life-science sectors along with an increase in global demand for Granite State products.Germany took over as New Hampshire’s top international trading partner, unseating neighboring Canada, while Ireland, Mexico and China rounded out the top five, according to the news release.Aircraft and spacecraft parts exports increased more than 68 percent from 2017, totaling $841 million, the news release said. Pharmaceutical products shot up 22 percent for $411 million, according to the news release.New Hampshire businesses have capitalized on international trade opportunities, allowing the companies a broader customer base through overseas markets, Gov. Chris Sununu said.New Hampshire exports posted a record value for the second straight year and third time in five years. The record total has also increased by nearly $1 billion since the 2014 mark of $4.23 billion.“From aerospace to the life sciences, New Hampshire is home to companies at the pinnacle of innovation,” Sununu said. “Throughout the last two years, we have focused on implementing a pro-growth agenda that opens doors of opportunity for companies not just in New Hampshire, but across the nation and the world — and the new record-setting export numbers prove it’s working!”"
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,Voters to issue ‘Kenogarten’ verdict this week,"Mar 9, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/politics/town_meeting/voters-to-issue-kenogarten-verdict-this-week/article_a90e57cd-2c6a-5829-968c-19ed9703b6cb.html,"CONCORD — The outcome of votes in 34 towns will go a long ways to determine whether Keno fully realizes the promise to deliver enough profits to offset much of the cost of full-day public kindergarten, according to lottery officials.Meanwhile at the State House, a vigorous debate is underway as lawmakers consider whether it’s time to entirely sever ties between the electronic, bingo-like game Keno and kindergarten aid (dubbed “Kenogarten” by the media) and instead require that state taxpayers pick up the entire tab for districts that went from half- to full-day schooling for 5-year-olds.The question of whether restaurants and bars should offer Keno appears on the ballot at town meetings this Tuesday or Saturday in towns from Whitefield in the Great North Woods to Brookline on the Massachusetts border.State lottery observers note the list includes some large and destination tourist towns that could generate significant profit, including Londonderry, Merrimack, Windham, Wolfeboro and Meredith.Since its outset in December 2017, supporters of Keno coped with critics pointing to state profits falling well below the estimated $9 million a year it was to generate in its first, full year of operation.At present, the game is only expected to bring in about $5.5 million for this budget year ending June 30, 2019.“The hope was that Keno would get us to full funding of kindergarten and give us what was needed to get us there. As we know now, the formula hasn’t worked, the revenue has fallen far short and Keno has been slow to get started,” said state Sen. David Watters, D-Dover, during a recent public hearing on legislation to break the connection between Keno and kindergarten.But New Hampshire Lottery Executive Director Charles McIntyre said annual profits would approach this level if the towns with Keno on the ballot endorse it this week.“This could bring us pretty close to our original estimate of Keno generating $8 (million) to $8.5 million a year,” McIntyre said during an interview late last week.McIntyre said his agency always maintained Keno would only make that kind of profit once enough communities approved it.“What folks don’t realize is that we started Keno with only five weeks’ lead time in the first fiscal year. We didn’t estimate it would bring in any money prior to June 30 and we got $1.6 million,” McIntyre said.“In state after state that adopted Keno, it’s taken a while for it to reach a full state of maturity.”Debate moves to cities this fallHe pointed out in these towns taking up the issue there are roughly 200 restaurants and bars with liquor licenses that could host the game.Based on past practice in the 66 communities with Keno, about one in three merchants have hosted the game so this would translate to 75 new outlets if all these towns endorse it.“We would expect if that’s the case then we would bring in about $14 million in revenue and $3 million more in net profit,” McIntyre said.By year’s end, McIntyre said the agency hopes to convince officials in five of six cities without Keno to consider putting the issue on their municipal ballots this fall.Lebanon city officials have already voted against having residents decide the matter this year, McIntyre said.The other cities without Keno are Portsmouth, Keene, Concord, Rochester and Dover.During Keno, players pick from one to 12 numbers, and every five minutes a computer randomly generates and displays 20 winning numbers from 1 to 80 on a television monitor. A player may place a wager from $1 to $25 per game.Gambling opponents maintain the game can be too addicting because compulsive bettors can quickly rack up significant losses if they’re playing it for several hours.Gov. Chris Sununu signed a law legalizing Keno as a way to help pay for all school districts to get $1,100 for each student in full-day public kindergarten starting in the 2018-19 school year.Based on current enrollments, that amount of per-pupil aid costs $11 million annually.The law grants all school districts with full-day kindergarten this per-pupil amount whether the town approved Keno or not.House and Senate Democratic leaders have gotten behind separate bills that have the state paying for the entire $1,800-per-student cost for districts that went from half- to full-day programs.State education officials estimate this would increase state aid grants to school districts by $9.2 million a year.Diverting Keno to constructionThe Senate this Thursday is expected to initially approve the measure (SB 266) of Democratic leaders to direct all profit from Keno to go toward restoring state building aid for local school construction projects.During the last recession in 2008 the state placed a moratorium on support of future projects and since then the backlog of school construction work has exceeded $250 million.“Property taxpayers and kindergarten school children should be treated the same as all other public school children,” said Senate Majority Leader Dan Feltes, D-Concord.“Banking on Keno to support this program is fiscally irresponsible and unfair to our kids and our communities.”A spokesman for Sununu said Keno once fully adopted would raise enough to reach the $1,100-per-student benchmark in state law.“It is important to note that Keno implementation remains in its infancy. As Keno is expanded to more communities throughout the state, revenues will rise and school districts will receive more state funding,” said Ben Vihstadt, Sununu’s spokesman.“We are confident that as Keno is adopted on a wider scale, communities will receive increased funding for full-day kindergarten programs. Every school district will receive at a minimum $1,100 per-pupil in state funding regardless of Keno revenues.”Watters said creating a dedicated account with Keno profits for school building projects could convince many districts to repair ailing buildings.“It has been a real struggle for communities that have to build new school facilities that they are not getting money from the state,” Watters said. “We would be providing lasting property tax relief if we finally did something with school building aid.”With current Keno revenue, Watters said this would allow the state to support the top three school construction projects that the Department of Education already ranks in terms of need.The House endorsed and sent to its Finance Committee for review its bill (HB 184) that would pay for full-day kindergarten and divert Keno into more education aid grant money.Sununu did not propose a major change in Keno or increase in education aid grants in the two-year state budget he proposed last month.Keno offers merchants 8 percent of gross sales, which is among the largest in the country.McIntyre said this contributes to why a University of New Hampshire Survey Center poll the Lottery paid for found four of five merchants with Keno said they were likely to renew their licenses and the game had no negative impact on their establishment.More than half of those surveyed said Keno increased revenue to their bottom line, and they recommend other businesses offer it, the survey said.McIntyre said this favorable word of mouth is helping the state’s profit as well.“We have seen in the last four weeks our sales reach a record level and that’s a credit to our licensees who are seeing consumers come to their establishment enjoy these games and doing what they can to promote it,” McIntyre said.State lottery officials maintain Keno helped its other offerings.“We estimate that it’s brought in as much as $1 million more a year in the sale of Powerball, scratch tickets and other games we offer to these consumers,” McIntyre said.klandrigan@unionleader.com"
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,Insurers show interest in Sununu's family leave plan,"Mar 9, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/politics/state/insurers-show-interest-in-sununu-s-family-leave-plan/article_36dae0b6-e1f3-5316-82c0-8dc3a81f99cd.html,"The two-state family and medical leave plan proposed by the governors of New Hampshire and Vermont earlier this year has passed an early test: Insurance carriers appear interested in participating.The plan announced by Gov. Chris Sununu and Vermont Gov. Phil Scott in January calls for the two states to jointly contract with an insurer to provide family and medical leave coverage to all state employees, at no cost to the workers. Municipalities, private employers and individuals would have the option to participate in the program by paying premiums.If enacted, the plan would be the only one of its kind in the country. Four states and the District of Columbia provide paid family and medical leave themselves, and New York contracts with insurers for the coverage, but all of those programs are mandatory.The voluntary aspect of the governors’ Twin-State Voluntary Leave plan raises the risk that employees who expect to take advantage of the benefits will sign up while those who don’t, opt out, thus creating a costly and risky pool for insurers that could lead to a death spiral of higher premiums.Some experts are not convinced the model will work, but seven insurers responded to the states’ request for information by the Friday deadline and indicated their interest in providing the coverage, according to officials from both states.“We’re getting quite laudatory compliments from the insurance carriers. I was quite pleased with the two I’ve had a chance to review,” said Michael Pieciak, commissioner of the Vermont Department of Financial Regulation. “We haven’t seen anything, at least in the two that I’ve reviewed, that has given us pause. If anything, they’ve greatly encouraged the effort.”The seven companies that responded are Standard Insurance Company, The Hartford Financial Services, Total Administrative Services Corporation, ReedGroup, Anthem, MetLife and Sun Life Financial, according to Mac Zellem, Sununu’s budget director. Before going to a formal bidding process, the plan must still pass the legislatures — a significant obstacle given that there are Democratic majorities in both states that have proposed their own mandatory paid family leave plans.Vasu Reddy, a senior policy counsel at the National Partnership for Women & Families and an expert on family leave policies, has been watching the various proposals in New Hampshire and Vermont. She worries that the premiums paid by nonstate employees under the Twin-State Voluntary Leave plan will ultimately become unaffordable.“It’s definitely going away from what is already known to work, and I think it’s not likely to work by itself,” she said. “When it’s voluntary you run the risk of adverse selection. You would likely have a lot of people who don’t take part in the program until they know they are about to get pregnant or about to get surgery. When you have a mandatory publicly run fund, (costs) are spread out between people who need the benefit and people who don’t need it. … I guess I just don’t see how (costs) wouldn’t be passed on to the people paying the premiums” under the Twin-State plan.Vermont and New Hampshire officials say they have consulted with insurers and have come up with several provisions specifically aimed at reducing that kind of adverse selection.Companies, municipal governments and nonprofits that want to participate in the plan will pay lower rates, for example, if they can convince all of their employees to enroll. That would be an incentive for higher enrollment and create a less-risky pool. The states could also designate open enrollment periods to ensure that employees don’t just sign up when they intend to take the benefit.Sununu’s administration is confident that the cost for employees who voluntarily opt in — potentially anyone besides state workers, who would automatically be enrolled — can be kept to less than $5 per week, said John Formella, the governor’s legal counsel.“That’s the number we understand we need to be below in order for the plan to be affordable,” he said.Employers could decide how to manage the burden of that cost — either paying it themselves, passing it all on to employees, or splitting it.The premium cost for New Hampshire and Vermont’s state employees would be borne by the states. Pieciak said Vermont estimates that it would cost $2.5 million annually to provide family and medical leave coverage for its roughly 8,500 employees.Zellem said it was too early to provide a cost estimate for New Hampshire’s 10,000 state employees, but that the governor’s office is “very confident in the affordability for the state and the availability of state resources to cover this plan” without raising additional revenue.The biggest obstacle for the governors’ plan is in their legislatures.The New Hampshire Senate passed its own mandatory family and medical leave plan last month and it will likely gain approval in the House.The Senate bill would require that all employers provide 12 weeks of leave — for the birth of a child, caring for a sick loved one and other eligible reasons — at 60 percent of a worker’s wages. Employers could choose to self-insure or use the state’s program. They could cover the cost themselves or deduct a 0.5 percent payroll tax from their workers.The New Hampshire Department of Employment Security estimates that the state would collect $169 million from employers and employees annually to pay for the program. Sununu has labeled that an income tax and recently vowed to veto it during a speech to business leaders.His Twin-State plan would provide six weeks of leave at 60 percent of a worker’s wages. The direct cost to the state treasuries would be in the low millions — as indicated by Vermont’s $2.5 million estimate — but Democrats point out that those numbers don’t measure the cost to private sector employers or employees who would be paying the money directly to the insurance provider. That cost is still unknown and would depend on the rates agreed to by the insurance carrier that wins the contract.“To make a representation that you can get paid family and medical leave insurance by not paying for it — in other words just paying for the state cost — is a Trumpian level lie,” Senate Majority Leader Dan Feltes, D-Concord, said of Sununu’s plan.“The fact that insurance companies responded to it means nothing in terms of the impact for hard-working families and small businesses,” he added. “What it means is that this is a good giveaway to the insurance industry.”The Union Leader has submitted a Right-to-Know request for copies of the seven insurance companies’ replies to the state.tfeathers@unionleader.com"
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,New regulations on inaugural funds get bipartisan support in Senate,"Mar 7, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/politics/new-regulations-on-inaugural-funds-get-bipartisan-support-in-senate/article_63be7e18-924c-58cf-8dbe-4ba37b6d597f.html,"CONCORD — A bill to more aggressively regulate the finances of inaugural committees was expected to cause a partisan dust-up in the state Senate, where some Republicans viewed it as an unfair attack on Gov. Chris Sununu’s use of funds donated for his inaugural events.Instead, the debate and vote on the bill, SB 105, turned into a moment of bipartisan consensus, thanks in part to the intervention of Sununu himself.In the days leading up to the vote, Sununu apparently worked with Republican Sen. Regina Birdsell of Hampstead to craft some minor amendments and muster GOP support for the bill.“Our office worked with Senator Birdsell to amend the legislation so that fair and practical updates to the statute could be implemented,” said Sununu spokesperson Ben Vihstadt.“This legislation, with the addition of Senator Birdsell’s amendment, will continue to ensure transparency for current and future inaugural committees and our office supports this bipartisan compromise.”The bill limits contributions to inaugural committees to $10,000 per contributor, and requires the inaugural treasurer to report individual contributions. Any payments made from the fund to reimburse the governor or immediate family will have to be supported by receipts.The bill, sponsored by Sen. Dan Feltes, D-Concord, would take effect in 2020. It came out of the Senate Election Law Committee with a 3-2 vote, both Republicans opposed, but that changed by the time of the floor vote on Thursday.As the debate got under way, Birdsell introduced her two changes. One would eliminate the 48-hour requirement to disclosure expenditures, reverting to existing statute that requires reports three times a year.The other sets a minimum level of $1,000 for contributions that have to be reported. Individual contributions below $1,000 will not be subject to the reporting requirements.Feltes indicated his support for the amendments and the bill passed 22-2. It now heads for the House.“It is our job in the Legislature to regulate these inaugural slush funds and I appreciate the work of Senator Birdsell and others on a bipartisan response that curbs unlimited corporate special interest contributions, enhances transparency and eliminates public perception of possible self-dealing,” said Feltes.The New Hampshire Union Leader reported in December that the Sununu Inaugural Committee, chaired by Sununu’s sister Catherine Sununu, had paid more than $165,000 to the governor, members of his family and close advisers, including $50,000 to Catherine Sununu.The committee issued checks worth nearly $40,000 to the governor himself, including several for more than $5,000 for the purpose of “travel.”Sununu is the first governor who has been required by a 2016 law to periodically file donation and expenditure reports for his inaugural committee, although former Gov. John Lynch did so voluntarily and Maggie Hassan disclosed the donors to her committee but not its expenditures.Hoping to get some political traction from the controversy, Democrats on Thursday staged a protest in front of the State House, with protesters holding enormous facsimiles of checks intended to represent money paid to Sununu, his family and friends from the Sununu Inaugural Celebration fund.“I am pleased the Senate was able to come to an agreement on increasing transparency for inaugural committees,” said Birdsell.“These are fair and practical updates to current law and I am grateful the governor has shown support for this legislation. I hope that we can now put the petty partisan attacks on this issue behind us.”Former state Sen. Bette Lasky on Thursday delivered a letter to the Attorney General, asking “which specific bureau or unit of the Department of Justice is charged with oversight of gubernatorial inaugural committees, such as the Sununu Inaugural Celebration, Inc.?”The letter is in response to published reports in which officials from the Department of Justice suggested there is no state agency with statutory oversight of inaugural committees.dsolomon@unionleader.com"
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,Democrats in NH House reverse GOP election laws,"Mar 7, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/politics/democrats-in-nh-house-reverse-gop-election-laws/article_1bbf6377-4aef-5b50-9093-fbd32510a10a.html,"CONCORD — One of the most significant policy achievements of the Republican legislative majority from 2017-2018 was passage of two election reform bills that tightened up the requirements for voter identification and proof of residency.Both of those bills were overturned by Democratic majorities in the House on Thursday. The Senate is likely to follow suit, sending the repeal bills to Republican Gov. Chris Sununu, who has his veto pen at the ready.“The bills passed today restore common sense to our election process and protect the constitutional rights of all voters,” said House Majority Leader Doug Ley, D-Jaffrey.“Voting restrictions passed last term were clearly intended to make it less desirable and more difficult for college students to vote in New Hampshire. Students live here, abide by our laws, pay taxes and are active members of our communities. Requiring students who vote to re-register their car in New Hampshire has no legitimate purpose other than to discourage the act of voting.”House Republican Leader Dick Hinch, R-Merrimack, described the election bills passed in the last two years as common-sense measures that made New Hampshire law consistent with voting requirements in other states.“HB 1264 and SB 3 did not make us any different from our neighboring states. In this past election, there were no reports of any voters being disenfranchised by the new requirements. In fact, voter turnout in college towns made records,” said Hinch, referring to the two laws passed last year.Both of those laws are being challenged in court by some combination of the League of Women Voters, Democratic Party, ACLU-NH, and individual plaintiffs.HB 1264 changed the definitions of resident to make voting in New Hampshire a declaration of residency, thus requiring a change of driver’s license and motor vehicle registration within 60 days of voting.SB 3 changed the procedures for voter verification, particularly for those trying to register within 30 days of an election.The bill to repeal the definition of residency law, HB 106, passed 213-154, while the bill to repeal the voter verification law, passed 209-155, both along party lines.Other election billsThe House could not muster the necessary two-thirds majority to advance a constitutional amendment that would allow anyone to vote by absentee ballot, without having to provide a reason for doing so. That measure, CACR 6, was tabled after a 208-158 vote in support.The House passed a bill, however, that accomplishes the same thing. HB 611, which passed 198-163, allows voters to request an absentee ballot without having to provide a reason.Another proposed constitutional amendment to allow 17-year-olds to vote in primary elections if they’re going to turn 18 by Election Day also could not get a two-thirds vote.The House voted by a substantial margin, 291-72, to defeat a bill that would require presidential primary candidates to release their federal tax returns for the past five years.The bill was seen as a threat to the broadest possible participation by candidates in the First in the Nation Primary, and came out of committee with a 19-0 vote in opposition.dsolomon@unionleader.com"
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,NH House passes death penalty repeal by a veto-proof margin,"Mar 7, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/politics/state/nh-house-passes-death-penalty-repeal-by-a-veto-proof/article_4d011f38-ff98-509f-ad82-f0d56847e32e.html,"CONCORD — The New Hampshire Legislature took a big step toward repeal of the death penalty on Thursday, with a veto-proof vote of 279-88 in support of House Bill 455.The bill revokes the existing capital punishment statute and replaces it with a penalty of life in prison without the possibility of parole for murder of a police officer or other capital offenses.New Hampshire currently has one person on death row — Michael Addison. Addison was sentenced to death for the 2006 killing of Manchester police officer Michael Briggs.Opponents of death penalty repeal argued that Addison will never be executed if capital punishment is repealed, while supporters of the repeal said the law would not be applied retroactively.No one has been executed in New Hampshire since 1939.Gov. Chris Sununu has said he stands with law enforcement in opposition to the repeal and will veto any repeal bill that lands on his desk.Today’s vote in the House would be sufficient to overcome a veto, which requires a two-thirds majority, even if all 400 representatives are present on the day of the anticipated override vote.The Senate is expected to approve the override with a veto-proof majority as well, since 16 of the 24 senators are already on record by virtue of past votes or campaign statements in opposition to the death penalty.That doesn’t mean an override is guaranteed, however, as lobbying by both sides will be intense in the run-up to the Senate vote, Sununu’s veto, and the summer veto override session.The debate on Thursday was somber and respectful, as lawmakers explained how they came to their positions on the issue.“In the past 50 years, one out of 10 people on death row have been exonerated because of poor representation, false science and prosecutorial misconduct,” said Rep. Beth Rodd, D-Merrimack.“Forty years of studies on the death penalty have shown it has no deterrent effect on future murders. The death penalty appeals process causes years of additional harm to families of murder victims, while executions fail to offer healing or closure.”Rep. Jeanine Notter, R-Merrimack, said some crimes are so heinous that the death penalty is the only option that offers justice.“I haven’t forgotten officer Briggs, and I hope you won’t either,” she said.“When a criminal is serving a lifetime in prison, if he kills someone in jail, there is nothing they can add to the sentence. When a murderer is in prison for killing a cop, they’re considered a jailhouse hero. I advocate for innocent lives, but if you believe in justice for victims of heinous crimes, please vote no.”Jeanne Hruska, policy director for the ACLU-NH, predicted that the Legislature will override a Sununu veto and erase the death penalty from New Hampshire statutes.“In these divisive times it’s just great to see an issue where both sides can come together and show such strong support,” she said. “Given the vote count today it seems like there is veto override support in the House, and we think there are 16 votes in the Senate.”Last June, Sununu vetoed a similar bill, SB 593, which had passed both the House and Senate with bipartisan majorities. The override failed in the Senate and therefore did not come before the House.All other New England states have abolished the death penalty, the most recent being Connecticut in 2012.dsolomon@unionleader.com"
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,Kevin Landrigan's Granite Status: Democrats continue special election win streak,"Mar 6, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/politics/granite_status/kevin-landrigan-s-granite-status-democrats-continue-special-election-win/article_ee1d8656-9bbe-51e1-b5b9-8b097a9bdff4.html,"By any definition, it was a big special election win Tuesday for Democrats in Concord and Nashua municipal races.The first question is whether the Republican party, under new Chairman Steve Stepanek, had enough time and money to affect the outcome after five weeks at the helm.The second is whether this will be a harbinger of even more Democratic wins in special elections to come through 2020 as we saw throughout 2017-18.In Nashua, Ben Clemons won a citywide seat on the Board of Aldermen with a 2-1 margin over former Alderman-at-Large Fred Teeboom, a fiscal conservative.Clemons had the entire Democratic Party establishment behind him as the brother of a national political operative and the son of former Rep. Jane Clemons, who for years was chairman of the city’s House delegation.Democratic Party Chairman Raymond Buckley said the win continued a streak of party domination in the Gate City.“We have steadily been making progress in Nashua over the past several years, and this was a real satisfying victory in what should have been a very competitive race,” Buckley said.To be sure, Teeboom hurt himself with comments in the community that critics said were homophobic. Over the years, Teeboom also has had strident fights with school administrators along with court battles with the city over the now-unenforceable tax cap.But Buckley said Teeboom had his followers.“Fred had served citywide twice before in Nashua. Voters in every community tend to be supportive of having at least one gadfly on a government board so as to keep everyone honest,” Buckley said.He was alluding to Manchester’s Alderman-at-Large Joe Kelly Levasseur, a Republican, whom the voters have returned to city government even as more Democrats get elected.“I didn’t want to mention his name,” Buckley said, referring to a longtime feud the two have had.Buckley said a turning point in Nashua’s Democratic dominance came in 2017 when young Democrats helped elect three people to citywide seats on the board: Shohanna Kelly, Brandon Laws and David Tencza.Both the citywide and young Democrats groups worked together in 2018 to scoop up all Nashua seats in the House delegation and run up big totals that helped Nashua Democrat Debora Pignatelli return to the Executive Council and Michael Conlon beat Nashua Republican incumbent Dennis Hogan as Hillsborough County attorney.Stepanek said those kind of devastating results weren’t going to be undone in a month. “There are parts of Nashua where Republicans remain strong and we’re going to start with those,” he said.Retired Nashua car dealer Jack Tulley has agreed to chair the Nashua GOP City Committee, and Stepanek said they’ll get about the job of rebuilding a financial base and recruiting candidates to run for local, state and county seats over the next 18 months.In Concord, Zandra Rice Hawkins of the liberal interest group Granite State Progress took back a Concord City Council seat in Ward 10 that Republican Dan St. Hilaire had held until Gov. Chris Sununu nominated him to a superior court judgeship.Likewise, Byron Champlin, a three-term city council member, Democratic fundraiser and supporter, easily won a citywide seat on the council over three rivals.Stepanek said despite St. Hilaire’s pedigree, the Concord GOP has a lot of catching up to do.“We’ve got our work cut out for us in Concord; it’s a Democratic enclave, but we’ve got supporters in the city, of course, and the challenge going forward is to organize them and strategically try to make gains,” Stepanek said.Bringing the ’18 band backRepublican losses in those midterm elections last November haven’t dampened the spirits of candidates prepping for another run at it in 2020.Eddie Edwards of Dover, the GOP nominee in the 1st Congressional District, told conservative activists last week that while the decision isn’t definite yet, he’s serious about seeking a rematch with U.S. Rep. Chris Pappas, D-NH.The nonpartisan Cook Political Report this week identified this seat as one of only two in New England now held by a Democrat where Trump won in 2016.Former Nashua GOP state Rep. and 2nd Congressional District nominee Steve Negron says he “hasn’t stopped running” and intends to again try to defeat four-term U.S. Rep. Annie Kuster, D-NH, next year.Then there’s Lynne Blankenbeker, the former Concord state representative and Navy veteran who lost to Negron in the 2018 GOP primary. Blankenbeker told the Right of Center meeting earlier this week that she too could join the field.Stepanek said he’s not surprised those who came up short last time are looking to get back into the arena.“I think part of that is the Trump factor; no question about it that the liberal base was fired up during the midterm, but next year all those who support this President and his policies are going to come out of the woodwork,” Stepanek said.Gregg: Buck TrumpFormer U.S. Sen. Judd Gregg, R-NH, joined a growing number of Republican voices calling for the GOP majority in the Senate to buck President Trump and block his declaration of an emergency to build the border wall.In a lengthy op-ed published in The Hill on Wednesday, Gregg said Trump came into office in 2016 vowing to shake things up, but he has cheapened the office.“Unfortunately, his waves of tweets and helter-skelter approach have compromised the office of the presidency,” Gregg wrote.“He came into office with the stated purpose of creating disorder in Washington. But in doing so, he has degraded the status of the presidency, so that it no longer serves as an emblem of the higher calling that Americans expect and the world needs.“In the process, he has inflicted wounds upon his own ability to pursue his agenda.”The opinion piece also condemns congressional Democratic leaders for pushing their agenda to the “socialist” left.But Gregg said Senate Republicans should block this declaration and defend the separation of powers.“One can understand that Republicans in the Senate do not wish to end up divided from the Republican President. “This is not a good political place to be. But Republican senators should be committed to doing the politically difficult thing,” Gregg wrote.“A Republican Senate should be made up of individuals who are strong enough in their own right to stand for the institution’s unique role,” he wrote.“Political gain will not result from the Republican Senate asserting the right of the entire Senate to be a separate and equal branch of government rather than an adjunct to this or any other president.“But even if walking down that path may involve some political discomfort, it is the right and necessary route to take,” he concluded.Bill O’Brien explores Senate bidTo the delight of GOP conservatives, former House Speaker Bill O’Brien of Mont Vernon has confirmed he will seriously explore a campaign against U.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen in 2020.O’Brien left elective office voluntarily in 2016 to pursue business interests.But he said at the time that this was not a ride off into the sunset, never to return to elective politics.Those close to O’Brien insist this exploratory campaign will be careful and only become a campaign if O’Brien is convinced he can raise enough money (read multimillions) for this race to be competitive.O’Brien has already gotten some encouragement.Both U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and former U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich have said they would endorse O’Brien and help him get the financial stake he would need to make this race a reality.Whether O’Brien ends up running or not, the move is a helpful one for it signals the state GOP is determined not to allow Shaheen to have a sleepy reelection campaign.The only other Republican who hasn’t ruled out a 2020 Senate campaign is Jay Lucas, a 1998 GOP nominee for governor and New London businessman.For the next several months, Lucas will be singularly focused on the economic development and education initiative he launched in his hometown of Newport.Pappas seeks Wounded Warrior fellowRep. Pappas has joined the Wounded Warrior Fellowship Program in the U.S. House and is taking applications to hire an advocate for veterans who will work in his Manchester office.The program is limited to veterans and requirements include that the person has a service-connected disability and has been honorably discharged from active duty within the last five years.“Our veterans should never have to jump through hoops to access the care they’ve earned, and I am glad we will have another fellow to help our veterans navigate complex federal agencies,” Pappas said. “If you, or someone you know, is interested in this rewarding position, I encourage you to contact our office and learn more.”Those interested should contact Pappas’ office at 285-4300.Conservative AFP praises Hassan in digital ad buyIt’s not every week the fiscally conservative Americans for Prosperity spends money to thank Sen. Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., for her service.That’s just what they did this week with digital ads praising Hassan for being one of eight original sponsors of legislation to give Congress a vote on certain tariffs before they can take effect.AFP has endorsed the Bicameral Congressional Trade Authority Act.“Imposing barriers to economic growth and taxing American consumers and businesses in the form of tariffs threaten to undo the economic growth we’ve experienced the past two years. New Hampshire job creators, consumers, and workers have been harmed by counter-productive tariffs that Congress has had no say in,” said Greg Moore, AFP’s state director.“Congress should have a vote on tariffs proposed by a president before they take effect. We thank Senator Hassan and urge her to continue working to remove trade barriers and protect Granite Staters from these unnecessary taxes.”2020 Democratic candidate parade continuesNew Hampshire’s 2016 presidential primary winner Bernie Sanders finally begins his first-in-the-nation primary campaign here this Sunday with a mid-day rally at the Grappone Conference Center in Concord.Before that, Sanders will make campaign stops Saturday in Iowa, which will hold the first caucus next year.Before this big return, two other Democrats with presidential thoughts will come back Friday.Pete Buttigieg, mayor of South Bend, Ind., and declared 2020 candidate, will headline the Politics and Eggs forum at the New Hampshire Institute of Politics on Friday morning.Also on Friday, two-term U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., will continue his 2020 exploratory campaign with three stops. Bennet will start the trip meeting with City Year members in Manchester, tour and host a town hall with employees at Graphicast in Jaffrey and conclude the trip with a house party at the home of Gerri and Ron King in Concord.New PAC hitting Feltes with familiar GOP namesAs my colleague David Solomon reported, a new political advocacy organization, A Better New Hampshire, financed radio ads airing Wednesday that attacked Dan Feltes, Senate Majority Leader and potential 2020 Democratic candidate for governor, over his support for altering the work requirement under Medicaid expansion.The group formed on Feb. 4, and in its filing, the principals said they would not be making independent expenditures directly on behalf of candidates for the 2020 election.Both named individuals with the group are with the Manchester public relations firm of Spectrum Marketing. The chairman of the group is Chuck McGee, a former state party executive director, and the treasurer is Kerry Marsh, who has chaired the Merrimack County Republicans and played a major part in the state campaign of GOP presidential candidate Carly Fiorina.In 2005, McGee received a seven-month federal prison sentence for his role in the scandal of jamming Democratic campaign phones on Election Day in 2002.Since then McGee has worked without controversy in the background on behalf of conservative candidates and causes.Shaheen pushes for continued opioid grantsShaheen’s signature led a letter from the entire congressional delegation urging President Trump to extend big spending increases for New Hampshire to fight the opioid epidemic. Without further action, some of the grants will expire at the end of this October.Shaheen and Co. urge Trump to put them into the annual budget he’ll present to Congress in the coming weeks.The last bipartisan budget agreement included set-aside grants for New Hampshire and other states hardest hit by the epidemic. Those changes led to more than a seven-fold increase in annual grants to New Hampshire through the State Opioid Response Grant Program.“Given the scale and scope of the opioid crisis, we need to work together to ensure that resources are available over the long term to meet the challenge,” Shaheen said.BIA sounds warning on setting PFAS levelsThe state’s largest business lobby warned the state Department of Environmental Services to do its homework before creating state maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) for perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS).The concept of setting PFAS standards at the state level enjoys strong support in the Democratically led Legislature and is a top priority of environmental activists for the 2019 session.In testimony given earlier this week, however, Business and Industry Association President Jim Roche said a DES summary report does “fall far short” of identifying the full cost of setting these standards.“Finally, the department needs to appropriately answer the most basic question: Will lowering MCLs have any measurable effect on health outcomes? To date, this question has not been properly addressed,” Roche said.klandrigan@unionleader.com"
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,Black Balloon Day event held in Concord to remember those lost to overdoses,"Mar 6, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/stigma/black-balloon-day-event-held-in-concord-to-remember-those/article_0e320cf0-d6e3-56d5-888c-2db719f3205a.html,"CONCORDA s Jasmine Lamontagne began naming all the friends she has lost to drug overdoses, the human cost of the epidemic felt suddenly unbearable: Tanita. Bart. Adam. Tony. Daniel. Chrissy. Ashley. Evan. Chris. Jacob. John. Celina. Abby. Greg. Jeff.And, Lamontagne said, “The list goes on and on.”Wednesday was Black Balloon Day, an event held to remember the daughters and sons, mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers, friends and co-workers who have died in an epidemic that each year kills more Americans than the entire Vietnam War.With the March wind making the temperature feel like single digits, about 100 people gathered on the State House lawn, many carrying bunches of black balloons.Shannan Landry, whose older sister, Tanita Landry, died of a fentanyl overdose in 2016, organized the event. She collected nearly 300 photos of individuals who have died in the epidemic, displaying them on posters.Each photo “represents hundreds of broken hearts and unfulfilled dreams,” Landry said. “I couldn’t help but think about what these men and women’s aspirations were, who they loved and who loved them, and who they left behind.”Seven years into the state’s opioid epidemic, the ripples of loss and pain still spread across New Hampshire.Conor O’Keefe of Concord told the crowd that his mother became a heroin and fentanyl addict after 30 years of abusing prescription pain medication following surgery. He, too, started using drugs in his youth.But while he found recovery and sobriety, his mother did not, he said. “Even seeing her son and former using partner now living a sober life was not enough to convince her,” he said.His mother died of an overdose on Jan. 10, 2018.Gov. Chris Sununu offered brief remarks, commending the families of those who have died for fighting for more treatment resources. “It’s your stories that help drive better policy,” he said.The governor, along with his adviser on addiction and behavioral health, David Mara, then stayed for the duration of the event, listening to some of those very stories.Former state Rep. Phil Spagnuolo of Laconia said he’s lucky that he’s not one of the people in the photographs on display.“I walked out of the Billerica House of Corrections in January of 2016. Exactly two years later, I was elected to serve the state of New Hampshire in the House of Representatives,” he said, and the crowd applauded.“What that told me was that my community believed that people in recovery had something to say and they were finally willing to listen,” he said.Lamontagne, who is in long-term recovery and is director of outreach at Blueprint Recovery Center in Concord,, said New Hampshire has made progress on dealing with the opioid epidemic. But she said there are still not enough treatment resources for people to get help right away.She challenged the crowd to get educated, volunteer to help and use their voices to demand change. “This is your community,” she said. “Make a difference and stand up for what you believe in. Be persistent, and be so loud that they have no choice but to hear you.”Shannan Landry said her sister was in recovery for a while and attended a national rally in Washington, D.C. in the fall of 2015. After Tanita died, a friend who had gone to the rally with her, Zachary O’Brien, posted a video of her singing “Time,” an original song about addiction, on YouTube(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9wxB63aL4E).Landry said she’s watched her sister’s video thousands of times. “It’s one of the only places me and my family can ever see her face anymore,” she said.Zack O’Brien died a year after Tanita.Jessica Wheeler of Manchester brought a poster to the Concord event showing the faces of 21 friends who have died from drug overdoses. Wheeler, who has been in recovery for two years, said she came to show support for the families, and for others in recovery. “We are all in this together,” she said.There are more photos to add to her poster, Wheeler said. “Sadly, it’s the reality of our state right now.”Eric Ritchie of Hampton held a bouquet of balloons in memory of his friend, MacKenzie Dewer. One balloon read, “RIP ‘Mac’/Love ya always.”A second balloon said only: “Too many to name. May you rest in the sweetest peace.”Ritchie has been in treatment for a month, he said. Nodding at the photos on display, he said,“They had to lose their lives for us to get sober.”Landry asked those in the crowd who, like her, are in recovery to be “trailblazers.”“We need to tell and show people that recovery is possible and that we have found a new way of life and health,” she said. “We need to extend our hand to those who are still sick and suffering, and show them the way out.”“We need to be beacons of hope and strength,” Landry said. “We memorialize these lives here today by living ours.”"
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,Sununu in State of the State: 'Our great economy didn't happen on accident',31 min ago,https://www.unionleader.com/sununu-in-state-of-the-state-our-great-economy-didn/article_72c66807-3dfc-5b85-a4c4-5ee40636849b.html,"GOFFSTOWN — Standing before a crowd of business leaders at the New Hampshire Institute of Politics, Gov. Chris Sununu touted the Granite State’s strong economy and threw down the gauntlet to proposals from Democrats in the State House, which Sununu branded as “wacky” threats to the “New Hampshire Advantage”.Addressing a packed house on the St. Anselm campus for the Greater Manchester Chamber of Commerce’s State of the State Breakfast Forum, the two-term Republican governor pulled no political punches as he blasted Democrats and championed his administration’s low business taxes and a relaxed regulatory environment as drivers of the state’s economic successes.“Our great economy didn’t happen on accident,” said Sununu. “We don’t have the lowest poverty rate in the country on accident; we don’t have some of the highest wages in the country, on average, on accident, and you can’t just start saying ‘Well, I’ll do whatever the national Democratic Party wants’ all this ultra progressive stuff — holy cow is it detrimental.”Sununu saved his harshest criticism for the state Democrats’ two paid family leave proposals, HB 712 and SB 1.As currently written, both plans would institute a half-percent payroll deduction on all employees in order to foot the bill for 60 percent of wages for workers during 12 weeks of paid time off following the birth or adoption of a new child or while caring for themselves or another family member.Sununu labeled the funding method behind the proposals as an income tax, promising a veto should either of the plans make their way through the Legislature.“I can’t wait for that income tax to hit my desk,” said Sununu. “I’ll veto it three times over and maybe four just to make the point that this is not what New Hampshire is about.”On Twitter, state Democratic Party Chairman Ray Buckley categorized Sununu’s address as “angry and frustrated,” going on to tell the Union Leader that the only good thing about the governor’s first term was that he “proved too incompetent to enact his radical agenda of destroying our unions, defunding public schools, and stripping Granite Staters of the right to vote.”“Voters made Sununu the first Republican Governor surrounded by Democratic majorities in New Hampshire history because they’re tired of having a Governor who only looks out for himself, his family, and his lobbyist friends,” said Buckley.Sununu is, in fact, the first Republican governor since the Civil War to preside over a government where Democrats control the Legislature.While partisan politics featured heavily in the governor’s address, Sununu also laid out proposals he intends to implement to further bolster the state’s workforce, including a tuition free community college program that would allow high school seniors to attain their associate’s degree by splitting up their final year into two at a charter school embedded in a community college.Stating that a year of high school costs the state roughly $15,000 compared to $7,500 for a year of community college, Sununu said the plan would allow students to attain two degrees for the same price.“It didn’t cost taxpayers a dime, it created an opportunity for those students and it’s, again, hard-wired with private partners.”"
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,Debate over work requirement threatens bipartisan support for Medicaid expansion,"Mar 6, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/politics/state/debate-over-work-requirement-threatens-bipartisan-support-for-medicaid-expansion/article_00b46e54-2cfe-5a2e-a408-241147ce0eb2.html,"CONCORD — A fragile bipartisan consensus on expanding Medicaid coverage to an additional 50,000 New Hampshire residents is unraveling, as Republicans protest a Senate bill to water down, some say neutralize, a work requirement for able-bodied adults in the program.A Senate committee on Tuesday voted 3-2 along party lines to advance Senate Bill 290, which would, among other things, terminate the work requirement if it results in more than 500 people losing their government-funded health insurance.Democrats amended the bill just before the committee vote in the hope of addressing some of the concerns raised by Republicans, removing the original bill’s exemption for people 50 and older for example.But the changes were not enough to mollify Republicans, many of whom view the proposed changes to the work requirement as a betrayal.“Absolutely a betrayal,” said Sen. Jeb Bradley, R-Wolfeboro, one of the chief negotiators in the Medicaid compromise, along with Senate Majority Leader Dan Feltes, D-Concord.“I can’t express how angry I am,” said Bradley. “We went out of our way to try to build the cooperation and Sen. Feltes has just blown it up.”The primary sponsor of the bill is Sen. Cindy Rosenwald, D-Nashua, but it has several Senate and House Democratic co-sponsors, including Feltes.Deal was struckMost GOP-controlled state legislatures voted against expanding Medicaid as part of the Affordable Care Act. New Hampshire Republicans, with legislative majorities, agreed to go along with the most recent five-year extension of the program from 2019 to 2023 only if a work requirement was implemented.Now that Democrats have the legislative majority, attempts to water down the work requirement or eliminate it entirely, as a House bill would do, will make future cooperation difficult, according to Bradley.“The bipartisan cooperation that we painstakingly built involved six of us,” said Bradley, alluding to himself, Feltes, Rosenwald, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Morse, R-Salem, DHHS Commissioner Jeffrey Meyers and Sen. James Gray, R-Rochester.“And now two of them (Feltes and Rosenwald) are eviscerating that cooperation. And that makes it impossible to function in this building. It just makes bipartisan cooperation really difficult in the future.”A major factor motivating the Democrats’ efforts to modify the work requirement has been the experience in Arkansas, where 18,000 people, about a quarter of expanded Medicaid recipients in the state, were kicked off their health insurance coverage, mostly for being unable to comply with the administrative aspects of the work requirement.“The Trump administration’s recent changes to our bipartisan work requirement and the 18,000 people recently kicked off of their health care in Arkansas drive SB 290,” said Feltes, who challenged Bradley’s assertion that Democrats have not sought compromise.“We’ve met on multiple occasions with the Governor’s office, the Department of Health and Human Services and other stake holders in an effort to come to a consensus,” he said. “Any suggestion that we aren’t interested in making progress is not true and disingenuous.”House bill shelvedA House committee on Wednesday voted unanimously to shelve a separate House bill, HB 690, that would have eliminated the work requirement entirely, aware that such a move would only further antagonize Republicans.“The Health and Human Services Committee basically was concerned about the damage to the bipartisan coalition that would be done by repealing the work requirement at this time,” said committee member Rep. William Marsh, R-Wolfeboro.“We have no guarantee the House will not change again in the next five years, and our hospitals and doctors are expecting stability in the program, so we voted to retain the bill.”The vote in committee to retain was unanimous, 21-0.Democratic Rep. Jerry Knirk of Freedom, said he wholeheartedly agrees that people who can work, and are getting cash assistance or food stamps, should work.“But health insurance is different,” he said. “None of us can use it to pay our rent or buy groceries. It’s there as a safety net. That’s why I don’t like the idea of a work requirement that’s been tied to it, but I’ll honor the agreement that’s been made.”Republican Mark Pearson of Hampstead warned of voter backlash if the work requirement is eliminated or watered down to become a requirement in name only.“The reason we were able to pass the expansion is the work requirement,” he said. “It we take it out now, I could see a groundswell of people in the next election who would feel angry, betrayed and say ‘to hell with the whole thing.’”Ads target FeltesBradley offered a similar warning.“This program has to be reauthorized in four years, and if bipartisan cooperation on this issue is eviscerated, what’s going to happen four years from now?” he said. “The very people they think they are protecting are the ones who could get hurt the most.”Meanwhile, Republicans are targeting Feltes as someone who wants to “roll back work for welfare,” hoping to make a campaign issue out of the controversy if the Concord Democrat decides to challenge Republican Gov. Chris Sununu in 2020.A newly formed political action committee, A Better NH, launched its first radio buy on Wednesday with a 30-second spot highlighting the effort to redefine the work requirement and attacking Feltes.The narrator urges listeners to “Tell Feltes, no free rides on health care,” and provides his cell phone number.“Republicans should spend more time working to protect the health care of Granite Staters and less time making radio ads,” said Feltes.dsolomon@unionleader.com"
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,NH 'innovators' honored today for response to opioid crisis,"Mar 5, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/stigma/nh-innovators-honored-today-for-response-to-opioid-crisis/article_3d655913-164c-5bb1-a0ab-7543ea897a94.html,"A national advocacy organization is honoring more than a dozen New Hampshire “innovators” who are making a difference in the deadly opioid epidemic.The Addiction Policy Forum will recognize leaders of 11 organizations, including Manchester’s Safe Station and Rochester’s Hope on Haven Hill, that are “transforming” addiction prevention, treatment and recovery services. Gov. Chris Sununu will be the keynote speaker at the noontime event today at the Bedford Village Inn.The nonprofit Addiction Policy Forum gets most of its funding from pharmaceutical companies. The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) announced a partnership in late 2017 with the APF to fund state and local programs to address addiction. According to tax documents, the Addiction Policy Partnership received $3.8 million from PhRMA in 2017. It funds the online Addiction Resource Center and a national helpline.Kimberly Clapp, executive vice president of community engagement for the Addiction Policy Forum, said its “Innovation Now” reports focus on the 15 states that have been hit hardest by the opioid crisis. And New Hampshire, she said, has been “ground zero.”“New Hampshire was one of the first states to be hit hard, but we also feel like New Hampshire’s leading the way in responding to the crisis,” she said.Individuals and organizations being honored today are:• Fire Chief Dan Goonan and Chris Hickey from Manchester Fire Department, for the Safe Stations program;• Manchester Police Sgt. Peter Marr and Lara Quinoga from Manchester Community Health Center, founders of Adverse Childhood Experiences Response Team (ACERT);• Matt Eacott and Stephen Randazzo, Aware Recovery Care;• Eric Spofford, founder of Granite Recovery Centers;• Keith Howard, executive director, Hope for New Hampshire Recovery;• Kerry Norton, Hope on Haven Hill, Rochester;• Tilton Police Chief Robert Cormier and Winnisquam Regional School District Superintendent Robert Seaward, for Law Enforcement Against Drugs (LEAD);• Doug Griffin, founder of Mercy Street in Plaistow;• Dr. Julie Frew and Dr. Daisy Goodman, creators of Dartmouth-Hitchcock’s Moms in Recovery;• Annette Escalante and Jill Burke, New Hampshire Student Assistance Program; and• Grace Rosado, founder of New Life Home for Women and Children, Manchester.Clapp said the Addiction Policy Forum has three criteria for choosing those to honor in each state; the first is an innovative approach to addiction. Secondly, she said, “Are they having an impact in such a way that they could be a model for the nation?”And finally, she said, “Are the people behind the initiatives or the programs passionate about changing the way we respond to addiction?”Clapp, a recent transplant to Hanover, said many New Hampshire programs have grown out of the pain of individuals who have lost loved ones to addiction; one example is Mercy Street, a support program created by a father whose 20-year-old daughter died from an overdose. “They feel they have to dedicate their lives to saving the next family’s child,” she said.And some programs are already being replicated in other states, Clapp said.“Part of this is re-imagining the response to addiction,” she said. “No one ever imagined that firefighters or police officers would be in a role where they would knock on people’s doors and offer them a warm hand-off to treatment, but that’s what we’re seeing now.”“And that’s the kind of innovation and creative responses that we want to highlight and showcase, so it can be replicated and we can bring hope to try to tackle this massive crisis,” she said."
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,Drugmaker going bankrupt would halt state's lawsuit,"Mar 5, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/courts/drugmaker-going-bankrupt-would-halt-state-s-lawsuit/article_7720df25-aa53-5083-b899-dec5cda64b76.html,"CONCORD — State prosecutors say if Purdue Pharma, the maker of OxyContin, files for bankruptcy it would likely keep “from coming out” allegations the drugmaker used deceptive marketing practices to get patients hooked on opioids that fueled New Hampshire’s epidemic.According to multiple news outlets, the company’s owners are considering this course as a way to deal with more than 1,600 lawsuits brought against the firm in more than 40 states, including New Hampshire.Senior Assistant Attorney General Jim Boffetti said if this comes to pass, Purdue could escape much of the testimony in upcoming trials here and across the country about charges it misled the public about how addictive these painkillers were.“From my perspective part of the importance of this case was that the facts be brought out and that the public learns exactly what these companies were doing and how we got to this crisis,” Boffetti said during a telephone interview.“There was a sense of justice that was needed here. We need to expose what in fact they did and this could keep that from coming out.”Boffetti was in Washington Tuesday for a conference of the National Association of Attorneys General focusing on the opioid epidemic and legal strategies.The first state lawsuit against Purdue Pharma is scheduled for trial in Oklahoma this May.New Hampshire has battled with the company in state and federal courts since it first sued Purdue in August 2017 in Merrimack County Superior Court.After several skirmishes, the two sides are in the discovery phase of that case with a trial likely about a year away, Boffetti said.“This is a real time-consuming process. There are millions of documents being produced by both sides and Purdue has been very aggressive in redacting information from our complaint,” Boffetti said.Purdue officials have denied that they deceived the public, pointing out the drugs were approved for use by federal regulators.And they declined comment this week when asked whether they were exploring bankruptcy.“As a privately held company, it has been Purdue Pharma’s longstanding policy not to comment on our financial or legal strategy,” Purdue said in a statement.“We are, however, committed to ensuring that our business remains strong and sustainable. We have ample liquidity and remain committed to meeting our obligations to the patients who benefit from our medicines, our suppliers and other business partners.”This move would not affect a separate lawsuit the state has brought against Janssen, a subsidiary of drugmaker Johnson & Johnson, Boffetti said.Manchester, Nashua and roughly a dozen other communities have brought their own suits against Purdue and other defendants in federal court. Those cases have been merged into a nationwide federal case in Cleveland against the company expected to go to trial later this year.A spokesman for Gov. Chris Sununu referred questions about the matter to the Attorney General’s office.Members of the state’s all-Democratic congressional delegation condemned the strategy.“Purdue Pharma used deceptive and unconscionable marketing tactics that misled doctors and the public for years and helped fuel the opioid crisis, and I’m very concerned that now Purdue is considering using bankruptcy to shield themselves from the consequences of their actions,” U.S. Sen. Maggie Hassan said in a statement.Sen. Jeanne Shaheen said “hiding behind bankruptcy to further shirk responsibility is wholly unacceptable.”“Additionally, I urge the FDA to heed my previous request and explain how the agency is preventing other pharmaceutical companies from using the opioid crisis to turn a profit,” she said.Rep. Chris Pappas called the report “disappointing but not surprising.”“For far too long, the drug companies and drug distributors have reaped major profits while Americans became addicted and overdosed in increasing numbers,” Pappas said. “Families in New Hampshire and across the country deserve answers and justice.”Purdue and three executives in 2007 pleaded guilty to federal charges related to the branding of OxyContin and agreed to pay a total of $634.5 million in penalties. The state of New Hampshire wasn’t a party to that suit.klandrigan@unionleader.com"

Chris Sununu talked about the economy, health care, prevention and recovery and environmental concerns at Pease during the annual State of the State hosted by The Chamber Collaborative of Greater Portsmouth Tuesday morning.Sununu said he is heading to Canada in two weeks and has traveled around the country recruiting companies that may want to relocate to New Hampshire.""In this economy, businesses are very willing to move,"" Sununu said, noting that other states continuously raise taxes even when their economy is doing well.Sununu said workers in New Hampshire are doing well because of the robust economy powered through competition as opposed to regulation.""We have some of the highest wages in the country, but not because we raised the minimum wage,"" Sununu said.Sununu said his health care plans include a $24 million investment in nursing education programs through the University of New Hampshire system and a 10-year mental health plan which includes 60 new beds in Concord and 40 beds in communities throughout the state.""You have people sitting in prison that just shouldn't be there,"" Sununu said of the need for secure psychiatric units.Sununu said the newly implemented hub-and-spoke model for addiction treatment has already received national attention. He described plotting out the nine access hubs on Google maps so nobody in the state would have to travel more than 45 minutes for help.The governor also talked about his support for prevention efforts and the benefit of recovery-friendly workplaces.""We have a 2.4 percent unemployment rate. It's a win-win for everyone,"" Sununu said of employers who allow workers access to the recovery services they need while keeping their jobs.Sununu said finding the right standards for drinking water regulations and cleaning up groundwater are priorities.He said that as an environmental engineer he saw first-hand how contaminated military bases are. He said Pease in Portsmouth is no exception.""They are the filthiest, worst places in America,"" Sununu said. ""Pease was not immune to that.""Sununu wrapped up his speech by saying he is fighting for commonsense measures to improve the quality of life for people in the state because he wants his three children to stay in the Granite State when they grow up.""We need to keep the New Hampshire Advantage.

Chris Sununu's nomination of St. Hilaire as a superior court judge.Shoemaker is the division director of the state's board of professional licensing and certification.Champlin's victory means city voters will have another special election this year to fill his Ward 4 seat on the council.All the election winners will serve the remainder of terms that end in December.klandrigan@unionleader.com"

Sununu's budget includes funds for whitewater park,"Mar 5, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/nh/travel/attractions/gov-sununu-s-budget-includes-funds-for-whitewater-park/article_001a91ef-51c2-5371-b710-806770e19f11.html,"FRANKLIN — Civic leaders are cheering Gov. Chris Sununu for including $1.5 million in his proposed 2020/2021 budget for the creation of a whitewater park, the first of its kind in New England, on the Winnipesaukee River in downtown Franklin.“When I visited Franklin last May to announce New Hampshire’s Opportunity Zones, I was intrigued by your vision for the Mill City Park,” Sununu wrote in a Feb. 22 letter to Marty Parichand, the executive director of Mill City Park at Franklin Falls.Sununu agreed that it was “only logical” that one of the rivers that once powered Franklin’s mills “should be part” of the city’s resurgence, in explaining why he recommended “a $1.5 million investment in one-time funds in my budget for Mill City Park.”On Tuesday, Parichand said if Mill City Park, which is a public/private partnership with the City of Franklin, is built, it would be a game changer for the municipality and region.He and others see Mill City Park “as the catalyst that fills up unused space, brings opportunities for entrepreneurs or makes fiscal sense for businesses to relocate to Franklin.”Also the features at the park “are just the kinds of things that attract millennials to the places where they not only play, but also work and live,” Parichand said.These features include three whitewater activities in the river where paddlers can hone their skills: a competition “hole,” a standing wave, and a training area for beginners and intermediate-level participants. The facility would also offer a bicycle “pump track, walking trails, and terraced steps/seating,” he said.“I think we’ll find that a lot of young professionals, young families, will start looking at Franklin with a new focus,” said Parichand, who is also the owner and operator of Outdoor New England, a canoe and kayak store located a short walk west of Franklin Falls.In January, the city was awarded a $512,000 Transportation Alternatives Program grant by the New Hampshire Department of Transportation to construct a pedestrian walkway on its existing trestle view bridge to connect Mill City Park to the base of the Winnipesaukee River Trail.On March 4, the Franklin City Council considered and was expected to approve the filing of an application to be used for Mill City Park with the Community Development Finance Authority for $750,000 through its Tax Credit Program.Outdoor recreation is booming nationwide, said Parichand, noting that, in recent studies, outdoor recreation generated $887 billion in revenue. New Hampshire has recognized the importance of outdoor recreation, he added, and a bill has been introduced this legislative session to create such an office within the Department of Business and Economic Affairs.Mayor Tony Giunta and Judie Milner, the Franklin city manager, echoed Parichand’s delight that Sununu is backing Mill City Park.“We all know that the economic benefit of a local tourist attraction extends well beyond the borders of the town or city in which that attraction is located,” Giunta said in a prepared statement on the city’s website.“I want to thank Governor Sununu for his vision in supporting this new segment of the tourism industry and helping us attract a whole new group of outdoor recreation enthusiasts to our City, surrounding communities and our State. I urge our legislators to please support this worthwhile initiative.”"
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,Lawmakers with pearl necklaces at hearing on 'red flag' bill stir social media,"Mar 5, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/crime/lawmakers-with-pearl-necklaces-at-hearing-on-red-flag-bill/article_ef9156c0-db59-59e9-9bd2-e028f50aa103.html,"CONCORD — Gun control activist Shannon Watts of Colorado, who founded Moms Demand Action for Guns Sense after the Sandy Hook school massacre, started a social media firestorm on Tuesday with a tweet from the New Hampshire State House.Watts tweeted pictures of male lawmakers sporting long pearl necklaces to her nearly 300,000 followers as she observed the morning session of Tuesday’s hearing on a red flag law proposed in the Granite State.Red flag laws allow for the confiscation of firearms from an individual who may be a risk to himself or others, based on a judge’s order.“Male New Hampshire lawmakers on the hearing committee wearing pearls to mock @MomsDemand volunteers and gun safety advocates,” Watts tweeted.Responses like “Those men are filth” and “Oh Look, sexists in the wild,” began to populate Twitter.The dictionary definition of “clutching at pearls” lends itself to Watts’ interpretation: “to behave as if you are very shocked, especially when you show more shock than you really feel in order to show that you think something is morally bad.”But that’s not what the pearls are about, according to Kimberly Morin, president of the Women’s Defense League of N.H., which has worn the pearls at gun-related hearings since 2016, starting at the hearing on a bill to allow concealed carry without a permit.“At the hearing for constitutional carry in Reps Hall, three of us were dressed in business professional clothes, wearing pearls, and someone from Moms Demand said they wouldn’t testify because they felt they were in front of a firing squad,” Morin said. “So we’ve been wearing pearls in defense of women’s rights and the Women’s Defense League since then, because we are moms just like they are only on different sides.”Members of the Women’s Defense League gave Gov. Chris Sununu a string of white pearls when he signed the concealed carry without a permit bill into law.Rep. David Welch, R-Kingston, was one of several Republican members of the House Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety sporting a string of pearls at the hearing.He said the pearls were handed out by members of the WDLNH as lawmakers and members of the public entered Representatives Hall. Many male members of the public could be seen wearing the pearls as well.“They gave them out to a whole bunch of us,” said Welch, who said he agreed to the symbolic gesture because he opposes the bill.Both sides came to the hearing with their symbols — strings of white pearls for opponents; red T-shirts for supporters — and both were well-represented by speakers and crowd support.Watts stands by her statement that the pearls were designed as an affront to Moms Demand Action, and they took it that way.“These lawmakers decided to wear symbols that essentially mocked the process,” she said.“They made light of this very important law that has been passed in nine states in the past year, and signed by Republican and Democratic governors alike. They showed they were not coming to this hearing with an open mind, and they were making light of survivors who were testifying on the suicide of a child, or women who were survivors of domestic abuse.”dsolomon@unionleader.com"

The fact that tuition and fees have increased less than the national average in recent years is a good sign.But another statistic in our Sunday News story on the system this week should be carefully considered: the number of New Hampshire public high school graduates has declined 11 percent from 2008 to 2017 and has no doubt dropped further since then.This is not a number unique to New Hampshire. The U.S. population is aging and the birth rate has fallen. Does a smaller pool of students mean UNH and its sisters will have to charge even higher tuition to make up the difference?By that logic, we will eventually get to the point of charging the last remaining student a few million dollars a year.Or perhaps not. Perhaps the USNH system should join with community colleges and the various private institutions to reinvent higher education, not higher costs, to better serve New Hampshireâ€™s needs in the 21st century.That sounds like what Gov. Chris Sununu is aiming at with his plan to reform public funding in concert with USNH and private business. More power to him."

Chris Sununu’s inaugural fund.The bill limits contributions to inaugural committees to $10,000 per contributor and requires the inaugural treasurer to report individual contributions over $1,000.Any payments made from the fund to the governor or immediate family will require receipts.Senate Bill 105, sponsored by Sen. Dan Feltes, D-Concord, would take effect in 2020. The Concord senator, who is now the Senate majority leader, is widely considered a possible candidate for governor next year.Feltes said there has been a lack of transparency in how inaugural committees raise money and what they do with it.“We’ve seen recently that we need to provide more transparency, including eliminating the possibility or at least the perception of self-dealing among the governor and their immediate family,” Feltes said in a Facebook video posted Monday. “SB 105 is important for transparency and public confidence in the system.”The bill emerged from the Senate Election Law Committee with a 3-2 vote, with both Republicans opposed, though no one is on record having testified in opposition to the bill.Last month, the Union Leader reported that the Sununu Inaugural Committee, chaired by his sister, Catherine Sununu, had paid more than $165,000 to the governor, members of his family and close advisers, including $50,000 to Catherine Sununu.Paul Collins, the committee’s treasurer and Sununu’s senior adviser, received more than $47,000.The committee issued checks worth nearly $40,000 to the governor himself, including several for more than $5,000 for the purpose of “travel.”Sununu has said previously that he is “ready and willing to work with the legislature to enact practical and fair updates to the statute.”“As you are aware, the Sununu Inaugural Celebration has fully complied and made all disclosures as required by law, and will continue to do so,” Sununu spokesman Ben Vihstadt said.Sununu is the first governor who has been required by a 2016 law to periodically file donation and expenditure reports for his inaugural committee, although former Gov. John Lynch did so voluntarily and Maggie Hassan disclosed the donors to her committee but not its expenses.Other Senate billsThe Senate will try again to address the costs of care for animals seized by law enforcement. Efforts to pass a bill last year fell apart amid a lack of consensus among breeders, rescue organizations, animal shelters and pet stores.“We and other stakeholders are approaching these problems with new solutions this year,” said Lindsay Hamrick, state director for the Humane Society of the United States.Since a highly publicized 2017 case involving Great Danes rescued in Wolfeboro, the Granite State has seen two similar cases — one involving 22 German Shepherds seized in Alexandria and Bristol, and a second case involving 52 Labrador Retrievers in Marlborough.“Combined costs for both cases have surpassed $400,000,” Hammrick said.The Senate will also vote Thursday on a bill to increase the age for legal purchase and use of tobacco products from 18 to 21 (SB 248).The 5-0 recommendation from the Commerce Committee is to send it back to the committee for continued deliberation in the second year of the two-year session.The recommendation suggests the bill may not have the votes to pass the Senate in its current form, and from the supporters’ perspective, keeping it alive in committee is better than letting it die on the floor.dsolomon@unionleader.com"
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,NH university system struggles to keep tuition low as it looks at 7 years of level funding,"Mar 2, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/education/nh-university-system-struggles-to-keep-tuition-low-as-it/article_3f62436d-99b4-512f-a292-590308ae1846.html,"When Todd Leach’s son was applying to colleges last year, his high school guidance counselor suggested that he take advantage of the in-state tuition match offered by the University of Maine.It wasn’t the kind of suggestion the chancellor of the University System of New Hampshire enjoys hearing about, whether made to his son or any other Granite State high schooler. Neither was Catherine Provencher, the vice chancellor for financial affairs, thrilled when her trip to Hampton Beach last summer was interrupted by a plane pulling a banner advertising the same University of Maine tuition match.The university system’s leadership is well aware that they are now in fierce competition with colleges in neighboring states for New Hampshire’s future workforce. More than 60 percent of high school graduates who plan to attend a four-year college leave New Hampshire to do so.That’s the highest rate in the country, according to the U.S. Department of Education, and with unemployment at 2.4 percent, the lowest in the nation, businesses are desperate for qualified employees.But New Hampshire is also at the bottom in another field: State government appropriated $2,701 per full-time student in fiscal year 2017, which according to the State Higher Education Executive Officers association was less than any other state besides Vermont, which appropriated $2,695 per student.USNH’s state appropriation has been level-funded at $81 million for the last five years, not even increasing with the rate of inflation. That will become seven years unless the Legislature increases the block grant Gov. Chris Sununu proposed in his budget for the next biennium.USNH officials aren’t raising an emergency warning, but they say that if the trend continues it will threaten their ability to both keep tuition low and remain competitive.“I worry about our ability to keep the cost down,” Leach said. “I worry about how rapidly we can respond to workforce needs if we don’t have the strategic funding to allow us to move in new directions.”“We are not going to put ourselves in a position where we need a state bailout,” the chancellor added. “What we need is a state partner in order to help keep … addressing the needs that industry has in the state.”Sununu’s two-year budget included a $24 million one-time investment to expand capacity for nursing and STEM programs — $3 million less than the university system asked for — and $18 million for capital improvements.Those are vital investments that will allow several state institutions to improve their capacity in fields in need of trained workers, Leach said.But there appears to be less consensus about state aid for the system’s annual operating budget, most of which goes toward cost reductions for students.“The governor believes that we must reform our funding model for public higher education and that by the state government, USNH and private business partnering together to provide funding, design curriculums and create direct pathways to employment we can achieve better results than simply by increasing the block grant amount,” Mac Zellem, Sununu’s budget director, said in a statement. The block grant refers to the $81 million USNH has received in each of the last five years.The governor’s office did not immediately provide more details about what Sununu’s proposed new funding model would look like.USNH has asked for an additional $4 million for its block grant over the next two years. It was not included in Sununu’s budget but the House and Senate must still weigh in.“Our appropriations request includes a marginal increase that fulfills statutory requirements, such as free tuition for National Guard students, and will directly be used to lower tuition rates for thousands of New Hampshire families,” Leach said in a statement responding to the governor’s call for a different funding model.During an interview on Thursday in USNH’s Concord offices, Leach and Provencher said they were proud of their efforts to keep tuition at the system’s six campuses low in the face of disappearing state aid.Over the past five years, in-state tuition and fees at New Hampshire’s public four-year universities has increased by 4 percent, according to College Board. That’s below the national average of 7 percent and even further below the 10 percent increase at Vermont’s institutions.In 2009 and 2010, the university system received $100 million each year from the state. But in the wake of the recession, then-Gov. John Lynch and the Legislature cut the system’s budget by nearly 50 percent for 2011 and 2012. It hasn’t achieved pre-recession financial support since.As a result of those cuts, a perception spread throughout New Hampshire that the quality of state schools would severely decline, Leach said.“Raising the tuition and having the perception out there that ‘I don’t know if I want to send students here because (state appropriation) was cut in half.’ … I don’t know if we’ve ever fully recovered from that,” he said Thursday.Meanwhile the number of public high school graduates in New Hampshire declined 11 percent between 2008 and 2017 and that demographic trend is expected to continue for several years, suggesting there will be an even smaller pool of students upon which the heavily tuition-dependent university system relies.“I think there is a challenge here. We have squeezed our margins to the point where it’s harder and harder to put dollars into strategic initiatives we want to make,” Leach said. “We’ve really done our part to try to keep these costs down, but if we’re going to meet the needs of the workforce, there’s some strategic investments that — because we’ve squeezed our margins down — we’re going to need the state’s help with.”tfeathers@unionleader.com"
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,State's effort to address gerrymandering attracts national attention,"Mar 2, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/politics/state/state-s-effort-to-address-gerrymandering-attracts-national-attention/article_112483e2-29ac-54c7-8ce9-9676054f88ea.html,"CONCORD — In 1812, Massachusetts Gov. Elbridge Gerry signed off on an oddly shaped state Senate district that looked like a salamander, and the term Gerrymandering was born.Ever since, politicians have been fighting over the phenomenon of electoral districts drawn to benefit one party over the other.With a census coming in 2020, new electoral districts for everything from state representative to U.S. Congress will be drawn, based on new population numbers. As things currently stand, the party in power at the State House gets to draw those districts.But that could change if any one of three proposals creating an independent redistricting commission clears the Legislature and is signed into law by Republican Gov. Chris Sununu.There is a House bill, a Senate bill and a proposed constitutional amendment, all designed to address what supporters of the legislation have described as the toxic effect of gerrymandering on New Hampshire politics.House Bill 706, establishing an independent redistricting commission, passed by a wide margin in the House on Thursday, with 16 Republicans joining all Democrats in a 218-123 vote, still short of a veto-proof majority.Gov. Chris Sununu has said he sees no urgency about changing the current system, but did not go so far as to promise a veto.Bills likely to mergeThe Senate version of a redistricting commission, SB 8, was the subject of a public hearing on Feb. 20, but it has yet to be scheduled for a vote in the Senate Election Law and Municipal Affairs Committee.A proposed constitutional amendment creating a redistricting commission was introduced in the House, but shelved by the House Election Law Committee, given the two legislative bills that are pending.It’s likely the Senate and House will work together on a final bill that will land on Sununu’s desk. Sen. Shannon Chandley, D-Amherst, is chief sponsor of the Senate bill, while Rep. Marjorie Smith, D-Durham, is sponsoring the House version.“I firmly believe those in elected office should not choose their own voters,” said Chandley.“The future of our democracy is brighter if we give the important responsibility of redistricting to a nonpartisan, independent commission,” Chandley said. “I am grateful for the work of my colleagues in the House of Representatives, particularly Rep. Marjorie Smith, on this critical issue and look forward to working together to build the best redistricting process we can for New Hampshire.”The House bill now heads for the Senate.National attentionAll of this activity is attracting national attention as the state Legislature takes the lead on an issue that has been advanced in other states by voter referendum.On the day of the House vote, the Brennan Center for Justice at the NYU School of Law heralded New Hampshire’s vote as a “turning point.”“In 2018, voters in five states — Colorado, Michigan, Missouri, Ohio, and Utah — approved reforms to limit extremely partisan gerrymandering,” the center reported on Feb. 28, “but the New Hampshire bill could mark a turning point for states that don’t have a ballot initiative process.”“This bill clearly demonstrates that it’s not just the people who are committed to fairness — lawmakers from both parties also increasingly get it,” said Yurij Rudensky, counsel with the Brennan Center’s democracy program.Despite such accolades, the bill still has a long way to go.It came out of the House Election Law Committee with a unanimous 20-0 recommendation of “ought to pass,: and was expected to breeze through the House. But, as the final vote showed, 123 Republicans voted “no.”Constitution is clearOpponents of the bills argue that the state constitution is clear in granting the right to draw districts exclusively to the state Legislature.They also pointed out that, despite complaints about Republicans gerrymandering House and Senate districts in 2011, Democrats recently won legislative majorities in the House, Senate and Executive Council.The House bill addresses the concerns about the constitutional language by requiring the commission’s final district maps to be approved by the House or Senate, which are exclusively responsible for their own rules.Rep. Kathleen Hoelzel, R-Raymond, ranking Republican on the House Election Committee, said her fellow Republican members had reservations about the bill as first presented, especially a clause that required the House or Senate to accept the new maps as presented.That was removed and Republicans in committee jumped on board, even though the vote put them at odds with their broader caucus.“I feel that the more transparent we are about how this redistricting is going, the better,” said Hoelzel. “The commission will have open meetings where people can submit their ideas, and I feel that’s transparent. In the end, we won’t have this controversy about why they did it behind closed doors, or they did it for their party.”Too optimistic?That may be just a bit too optimistic for America’s polarized electorate, according to Rep. Lynne Ober, R-Hudson, one of the Republicans who voted against the bill.“It’s being sold that we are going to use unbiased, neutral people. In this day and age with the ugliness we are seeing in the press and the ugliness in the news, I don’t think that process would find people who are 100 percent neutral,” said Ober. “Where are they going to find these people? Everybody I see is just going wild.”Manchester attorney Richard Lehmann, who served as legal counsel in the Senate for 13 years and is now in private practice, agrees with Ober. He testified against the Senate bill at a hearing on Feb. 20.“There is no such thing as an impartial committee,” he said in an interview on Friday. “Trying to get politics out of government is like trying to squeeze Jell-O. You can squeeze it as hard as you want, and it still makes a mess of everything.”If lawmakers want a commission whose district maps can’t be redrawn by the Legislature, a constitutional amendment is the only long-term solution, according to Lehmann.“They have a constitutional amendment in front of them, which is the right way to do it,” he said. “And if they’re serious about it, they should focus on that.”dsolomon@unionleader.com"
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,Dave Solomon's State House Dome: Financial disclosure bill faces first test,"Mar 2, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/politics/statehouse_dome/dave-solomon-s-state-house-dome-financial-disclosure-bill-faces/article_81b6f43d-8e69-5d0f-90fd-c453d20c3143.html,"This is the week we find out if there is any genuine desire among state lawmakers to put some teeth into an existing law that requires hundreds of upper-level state employees and commission appointees to file financial disclosure forms.The law is routinely ignored with no consequences, so a database maintained by the Secretary of State’s office is inaccurate and out of date.The law, known as Chapter 15-A Financial Disclosures, is designed to ensure that the performance of official duties “does not give rise to a conflict of interest” and states that anyone who is out of compliance cannot act on behalf of the state.But the law was drafted without assigning any individual or state agency the responsibility of enforcing the disclosure requirements.State Rep. Werner Horn, R-Franklin, has filed legislation (HB 150) that would impose a $5,000 fine on state employees who are required to file so-called 15-A disclosure forms but knowingly fail to do so, and would direct the Attorney General to examine the filings and enforce compliance.The bill is scheduled for a vote Tuesday by the Executive Departments and Administration Committee.The fact that the law is so widely disregarded was brought to Horn’s attention by Paul Morrissette, a Franklin businessman, developer and auctioneer who was among the unsuccessful bidders when the state issued licenses to open medical marijuana dispensaries.He’s suing the Department of Health and Human Services, claiming the agency didn’t follow competitive bidding statutes or its own bidding guidelines in denying him one of the licenses to open an alternative treatment center.As part of his legal strategy, he was hoping to determine whether any of the state officials involved in evaluating his bids had financial interests in the matter. When he discovered many officials had not even filed the required paperwork, he reached out to his state representative and state senator.State Sen. Harold French, R-Franklin, raised the issue with Attorney General Gordon MacDonald, who later issued an opinion, written by Associate Attorney General Anne Edwards.Edwards acknowledged that state officials should not act in their official capacity if they don’t file the required financial statement within 14 days of taking office, but then went on to say failure to file comes with no consequences: “It does not impact any actions the person took with respect to legislation, rule-making or other official functions.”Morrissette, who testified in support of the bill at its January public hearing, doubts the state will ever see the kind of comprehensive, timely and accurate financial disclosures Chapter 15-A requires.“After I testified, I had a couple of reps come up to me and they were very complimentary to me for bringing the issue forward,” he said. “It just seems so unjust that we arrest private people for minor violations in New Hampshire, but lawlessness by state employees is somehow different and has a defender on staff in the big office at Department of Justice.”Despite the Union Leader reporting on the situation, not much has changed.“I reviewed the 2019 list of everyone required to file,” Morrisette said. “What a joke. Not only are there many people who didn’t file, but organizational charts are not updated either.”When the Union Leader asked Gov. Chris Sununu about the gaps in the database last year, his legal counsel John Formella said the governor would like to see stepped up compliance, and would be looking for legislative action.Legislative updateBills on legalized marijuana, business taxes and election law got the most coverage coming out of a marathon two-day session of the House Wednesday and Thursday, but about 170 other bills either died or moved to the next step in the legislative process.Retired state employees who have been retired for at least five years could get their first cost of living increase in nearly nine years, with the passage of HB 616, which adds 1.5 percent to annual pensions. After Finance Committee review, the bill will be back for another House vote.A bill to create a citizens’ right-to-know appeals commission and a right-to-know ombudsman, HB 729, passed in a tight 177-165 vote, over the opposition of the New Hampshire Municipal Association. It now moves to Finance.A bill to give cities and towns the option of imposing a $2 municipal service fee per room, per night, on tourist-related room rentals passed 195-151, and goes to the Ways and Means Committee.dsolomon@unionleader.com"
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,Guns in school zones: Good intentions birth a terrible idea,"Mar 1, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/opinion/editorials/guns-in-school-zones-good-intentions-birth-a-terrible-idea/article_886c0c94-2a97-5464-a1b4-7ec64af9fcfc.html,"The house recently brought up, and passed HB 564. This legislation would make it a class A misdemeanor to knowingly carry a firearm in a “Safe School Zone.” This is one of many ideas touted as “common sense” gun reform. Unfortunately “common sense” does not mean well thought out. While it may seem like common sense to keep guns out of schools, this law does nothing to actually keep guns out of schools. It does not establish metal detectors and X-ray machines at school entrances. It trades on the false notion that if something is illegal it cannot happen. As many unfortunate shooting incidents in “gun free zones” have shown, those bent on committing heinous acts will not stop and drop their weapons because a sign on the door has a pistol with a red line through it.Especially troubling is the definition of a “Safe School Zone.” According to the law it means an area inclusive of any “school property.” “School property” means “all real property, physical plant and equipment used for school purposes, including but not limited to school playgrounds and buses, whether public or private.” “School purposes” means “school-sponsored programs, including but not limited to educational or extracurricular activities.” This creates an incredible problem for a legal gun owner trying to figure out compliance with the law. Sure they can’t legally walk through a school’s front door with a pistol. Can they be armed while walking their dog on a private soccer field that the high school uses for practice? Seems like that may be a “school-sponsored program” that suddenly makes that private property off limits to the legal gun owner, even if they own the property!We are all for deterring bad things from happening in schools. If laws alone could do this then impose even stiffer penalties for crimes committed in school zones with a gun. The key is punishing criminal behavior with a gun, not criminalizing otherwise legal possession of a gun. The only thing this law will accomplish is disarming otherwise law abiding gun owners, but maybe that is all according to plan. We trust that if this bill makes it to Gov. Chris Sununu’s desk he will not sign it. Bad legislation is bad legislation however good the intentions."
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,Richard O'Leary: In opposition to the death penalty,"Feb 28, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/opinion/columnists/richard-o-leary-in-opposition-to-the-death-penalty/article_a84bb98a-a696-533d-bfc8-07b81af486d4.html,"I spent 33 years as a Manchester police officer, ending with the rank of Deputy Chief of Police. I’m adamantly against the death penalty, and here are my reasons why:First, I don’t believe we have the right, under any circumstance other than immediate self-defense, to take a life. Almost every religion says, “Thou shalt not kill.” Once a murderer has been subdued, arrested, and separated from society, I cannot see where the state has any compelling interest in executing him. It’s simply wrong.Second, the criminal justice system is not perfect and innocent people can be killed. Take for example Cameron Todd Willingham from Texas, who was executed after being convicted for killing his three children in a fire. The only evidence was based on shaky arson science. Under today’s scientific practice, Willingham would now be alive and a free man. To date, The Innocence Project has freed more than 160 death row inmates who were wrongfully convicted across our country. How do you bring anybody back who’s been executed and who you later find out was innocent? You can’t.Third, how can we really decide which categories of victims merit the death penalty? How do we make a judgment on whose life is more important? My wife and I have six adult children. Two are teachers, one teaches kindergarten and one is at Central High and also a baseball coach. I have a daughter who’s a nurse in Rhode Island and a son who is a police officer in Manchester.One of my sons works as a chef. Another is a tech man at SNHU. As you look at the carnage across the country, all of these occupations have been involved in mass shootings. Think of the teachers down in Sandy Hook, Conn. In a recent shooting, it was a football coach who died. He was there when the shooting occurred because that’s where he works. How does my son, the baseball coach and teacher, compare to my other son who’s a Manchester policeman? Is a policeman more important than a nurse? More important than a teacher? More important than a tech man at a college? If I’m a lawmaker or on a jury, how do I choose for which kind of victim the perpetrator should get death, and for which kind he shouldn’t? I don’t think we should be making these kinds of distinctions among victims. Every murder is heinous to the ones who lose a loved one.Fourth, the death penalty does nothing to deter people from murdering. These people are drug addicts and crackheads most of the time. Are they really going to stop and reflect on their actions ahead of time and think, “I might get killed if I do this, so I better not”? That’s the furthest thing from their mind. In my prison work, I’ve had the opportunity to ask some of these folks, “Did you know you were going to face the death penalty or life in prison?” Absolutely not. They just acted without thinking. On the other hand, premeditated murderers just think they’re too smart and will never get caught.Fifth, the death penalty turns murderers into celebrities, and that’s not good for the family members of the victims. Today, everybody knows Michael Addison’s name. The guy he killed, officer Michael Briggs, was a standout policeman. But he’s gone now. So who gets remembered? Michael Addison, because of years and years of appeals. But notice how nobody talks about Cleo Roy, the guy who killed police officer Ralph Miller in the early 1970s here in New Hampshire, and who got life in prison. He’s pretty much remained a nobody for 50 years.I’ve been fortunate to talk to a lot of family members of murder victims. They were not interested in revenge. They just wanted justice by putting the guy away, so that they don’t have to keep being reminded of their loss every year for 15 or 20 years, every time another appeal happens.What does the death penalty do? Nothing. It takes another human life for no good reason. We don’t need the death penalty. Life in prison, life in a 6 by 10-foot cell with your freedom forever taken from you, is adequate punishment. It protects society and allows for the possibility of rehabilitation. That’s what jail is supposed to do.I strongly encourage Gov. Chris Sununu to sign HB 455 that will likely be passed by the New Hampshire House and Senate with bipartisan support."
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,Family medical leave bill clears first House vote,"Feb 27, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/politics/family-medical-leave-bill-clears-first-house-vote/article_5fbaa228-92fd-5e3f-8f46-1b562584451b.html,"CONCORD — A family medical leave insurance program that would be paid for by payroll deduction cleared the state House of Representatives in a 199-133 vote on Wednesday, keeping the legislation alive for consideration by another House committee and possible merger with a similar bill working its way through the Senate.Some form of paid family medical leave insurance is likely to emerge from the session that ends in June, with two proposals in the Legislature — one from the House and one from the Senate.Gov. Chris Sununu has proposed a bill of his own, in partnership with Vermont. The two states would offer paid family leave as a fully funded benefit for state employees, in the hope that the risk pool would be large enough to attract private insurance companies to offer the benefit as a form of short-term disability coverage to non-government workers.The House bill, HB 712, has a lot in common with the Senate bill, SB 1. Both call for withholding 0.5 percent of wages (an average of $5 per week) for a program that would provide 60 percent wage replacement for up to 12 weeks of leave annually.The Senate version already passed that chamber in a party-line vote and was heard in the House on Tuesday.“This bill has significant problems,” said Rep. Jack Flanagan, R-Brookline, of the House bill.“The funding mechanism is an income tax, at one half of one percent. There are issues of shortfalls, administrative expenses and reserves. What happens is the general fund is paying for the startup costs of this program, and if there are shortfalls, who’s going to pay for the shortfalls?”"

She’s the wife of Eric Trump, the President’s son, and has been a frequent surrogate speaker for POTUS at both political and special issue events.“I’m really excited about this and I think it speaks to the fact that New Hampshire is on the map with the presidential campaign and the Republican National Committee,” Stepanek said Wednesday.“The next time I hope it is the President we have as the headliner but I fully appreciate he’s a pretty busy guy right now.”Stepanek made the announcement days after the New Hampshire Democratic Party raised $400,000 at its McIntyre-Shaheen 100 Club dinner at the DoubleTree by Hilton hotel in Manchester.“This will be a general admission event and of course we’ll also have a VIP reception where photographs can be taken, etc,” Stepanek said.His goal is to sell 1,000 tickets, roughly the paid attendance at the Democrats’ event last Friday starring Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren.“There’s no question the Democrats under Chairman Ray Buckley have figured out how to monetize these events. We’ll seek to do the same thing. This will not be a sit-down dinner. There will be great hors d’oeuvre served because that way you can get so many more people into the venue,” Stepanek said.Sununu reveals details of Washington, D.C., tripGov. Chris Sununu’s office produced a full itinerary from his five-day trip to Washington, D.C. for the National Governors Association perhaps to rebut the narrative of state Democratic leaders that he was just “socializing with the Washington elite.”Among the events included Sununu’s team listed were meetings with the Japanese Business Federation to discuss potential U.S. investments and a session on prevention and intervention programs for at-risk youths with Save the Children advocates including actress Jennifer Garner, as trustee of the organization.Sununu took advantage of his one-on-one meetings with Vice President Mike Pence at the Naval Observatory and later with National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow to press for support of the new United States-Mexico-Canada trade deal while removing the harmful tariffs.Before returning last Monday afternoon, Sununu attended NGA sessions on the opioid crisis, mental health care and student safety.This NGA event came a week after the Democratic Governors Association held its winter meeting and one of its attendees was Senate Majority Leader Dan Feltes, D-Concord, who hasn’t rule out his own run for governor in 2020.Shaheen fights sexism on Senate committeePolitico posted a lengthy profile story that maintained Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-NH, has faced intimidating and belittling behavior at times from Trump administration officials while serving as the only woman on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.The story opens with an account that concluded Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was dismissive of Shaheen as she asked whether President Trump spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin about downgrading the U.S. presence in Syria in their recent closed-door summit in Finland.Shaheen said the tough response she got wasn’t uncommon from an administration whose top foreign policy has been largely dominated by men. The post of United Nations ambassador has been one of the few exceptions.“There have been some people who have appeared before the Foreign Relations Committee—more the Foreign Relations Committee than the Armed Services Committee, interestingly enough—who have been a little condescending,” Shaheen said in the report.The senator and former governor Shaheen is no shrinking wallflower. She has been widely credited for leading some of the Senate’s foreign policy initiatives including several with bipartisan support.In this piece, Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., lamented too often Shaheen has been forced to carry the debate on what have been seen more as women’s issues.“It should not be her burden to bear—to be the member of the committee who most often raises issues surrounding global women’s health,” Murphy said. “The rest of us should probably step up to the plate and take that responsibility off of her.”Liquor commission names new COOThe New Hampshire Liquor Commission chose to promote from within to replace its Chief Operating Officer Dan St. Hilaire of Concord who recently became a superior court judge.Rosemary Wiant was confirmed by the Executive Council to serve as COO and director of administration. That’s a move up from her position as legal counsel for the agency since 2017.Her state service included eight years working as an assistant attorney general and a stint with the Banking Department following work as a lawyer for the Disabilities Rights Center in Concord.Kuster goes after EPAU.S. Rep. Annie Kuster, D-NH, used one of her first hearings in the House Energy and Commerce Committee she’s now on to push Environmental Protection Agency Assistant Administrator Susan Bodine on the agency’s plan to address PFAS contamination in drinking water.Kuster and the entire delegation has been vocal in its disappointment the EPA action plan doesn’t contain enough teeth in it that ensure it would lead to a lower drinking water standard for these contaminants.“In New Hampshire, we’ve seen the damaging consequences of groundwater pollution, and I’m deeply concerned that the EPA’s failure to hold polluters and bad actors responsible will send a message to others that they can disregard environmental regulations,” Kuster said.“EPA’s enforcement penalties last year declined to their lowest level since 1994. This sends a message that our laws and the safety of our communities are not a priority. This is an unacceptable, dangerous precedent to set, and I will continue my efforts to pursue policies that protect communities in New Hampshire and across the country.”NH GOP pushes back on Born Alive billA longtime abortion opponent, Stepanek said he believes New Hampshire’s two senators will regret voting against a bill that would have threatened prison time for doctors who don’t try to save the lives of infants born alive during failed abortions.Only three Senate Democrats supported the anti-abortion bill. Shaheen and Sen. Maggie Hassan were joined in their opposition by all the six Senate Democrats either running or exploring a 2020 presidential run.The 53-44 vote for it fell seven votes short of the 60 needed to overcome a filibuster in the Senate.”Polls have shown as many as 80 percent of people in New Hampshire do not support abortions in the third trimester,” Stepanek said. “I’m not sure they fully appreciate how far out of the mainstream they are.”Opponents noted the rarity of such births and cited laws already making it a crime to kill newborn babies which they said made the bill unnecessary.During a speech on the floor, Shaheen said the badly-written bill would have violated a woman’s constitutional rights.“It would significantly interfere with the doctor-patient relationship and it would pose new obstacles to a woman’s constitutionally protected right to make her own decisions about her reproductive health. Regardless of what the intent of the legislation is, the fact is the way it is written, it intimidates doctors with the threat of criminal liability for performing safe and legal abortion,” Shaheen said.”It will have a chilling effect on the ability of women to access the services they need in the United States.”Hassan backs trimming presidential perks.   Sen. Hassan has agreed to cosponsor a bipartisan move to limit the taxpayer-financed benefits for former U.S. presidents.The Presidential Allowance Modernization Act of 2019 would impose a cap on former presidents’ allowances which are currently unlimited and pay for office space, staff, travel, etc.The bill would grant former presidents a $200,000 a year pension and $200,000 a year allowance. Those presidents would have the allowance reduced dollar for dollar for outside income they receive in excess of $400,000 each year.Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, has championed this measure that Congress passed but former President Obama vetoed in 20156.“This legislation would not affect funding for a former president’s security and is a common-sense step to ensure that taxpayer dollars are well-spent. I am glad to work with Senator Joni Ernst on this issue, and I am committed to working with members of both parties to find innovative ways to maintain fiscal responsibility within the federal government,” Hassan said in a statement.Castro picks NH state rep to run campaignFormer HUD Secretary and 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Julian Castro hired Nashua State Rep. Manny Espitia to direct his campaign in the first-in-the-nation primary state.Espitia is in his first term representing Nashua’s Ward 4 and serves on the House Labor, Industrial and Rehabilitative Services Committee.Nashua Democrats completed the clean sweep of all seats in the New Hampshire House during last November’s midterm elections. Espitia was executive director of the Nashua Democratic City Committee during the 2018 campaign.  River, historical park measure crosses finish line.  The bill to protect the Nashua River and also to designate the Saint-Gauden’s site in Cornish as a national historical park cleared the U.S. House and is headed to the President’s desk for his signature.The state’s entire congressional delegation has made the case and managed to insert these provisions into this measure that reauthorizes the Land and Water Conservation Fund. Former NH staffer heads manufacturers lobbyAlyssa Shooshan was recently named chief of staff of the National Association of Manufacturers, one of the more influential trade groups on Capitol Hill.She’s been at NAM since 2010 but had 17 years experience in the federal government much of it with former U.S. Sen. Judd Gregg, R-NH.Her last role for Gregg before joining NAM was as the senator’s chief of staff which prompted longtime Gregg staffer and campaign operative Joel Maiola to tweet in tribute, “Once a chief of staff always a chief of staff.”klandrigan@unionleader.com"
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,Heart of Nashua: Isn't it time NH stopped sweeping mental illness under the carpet?,"Feb 27, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/voices/heart_of_nashua/heart-of-nashua-isn-t-it-time-nh-stopped-sweeping/article_675b15b0-a2ce-5cbd-8679-f937d5b25b3d.html,"Funding. In some respects it’s a dirty word that gets in the way of a lot of decent proposals making their way to the State House. But when it comes to the issue of mental health, I think Gov. Chris Sununu sees the bigger picture.In his recent 2019 budget address, the governor announced plans for something long overdue — a $40 million investment for a new state-of-the-art facility to move those civilly committed out of the State Prison and into a new and secure forensic hospital.Sununu said he wants to re-engineer our mental health system with a 10-year plan. It’s refreshing to see someone who holds high political office actually put mental illness at the top of an agenda and continue to chip away at the cruel stigma that has existed for far too long.It is unacceptable for people in the throes of a mental health crisis to wait weeks for treatment, but unfortunately that’s what happens across the state.I have listened to numerous sad stories in this regard where a loved one’s family member is left basically stranded in the corner of an ER.As part of his multi-pronged effort, Sununu plans to change these conditions. Said the governor: “For the state’s part, we are allocating $3 million in immediate, one-time funding for grants to hospitals to create new treatment beds, and develop a solution to address the immediate due process needs of individuals who are waiting in emergency rooms today.”The governor says New Hampshire is stepping up to do its part, and he’s hoping the state’s hospitals join in the effort.Ken Norton, executive director of the New Hampshire chapter of the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), is hopeful Sununu’s mental health goals see fruition. Norton is the right person in this important role who has provided education, support and advocacy to thousands of Granite Staters. For his entire career he has fought to improve the conditions of those who struggle with mental illness.Norton recently told reporters, “It isn’t right to have people who have never committed a crime housed together in a correctional facility.”Norma Smith is one of the longtime volunteer facilitators at NAMI of Greater Nashua. She’s a compassionate woman with an easy smile and a lot of knowledge. “Funding the Ten Year Mental Health Plan is paramount to rectifying the crisis we find ourselves battling,” she told me. “Also, we need to recognize that mental health challenges are at the root of many substance use disorders. Many positive steps have been taken; we need to continue building momentum.”Smith believes that NAMI chapters are an excellent place to turn to. There are support and education groups for families and individuals living with mental illness and family-to-family classes.“We serve as a resource on many boards and committees throughout the greater Nashua area, try to strengthen and initiate alliances within the community,” Norma said,It will be interesting to see how the Legislature reacts to the governor’s plan.

Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,"Bill to legalize pot passes first test in NH House, 209-147","Feb 27, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/courts/bill-to-legalize-pot-passes-first-test-in-nh-house/article_d3afd61e-9c31-5a4d-88ac-f0ef27e3c89c.html,"CONCORD — A bill to legalize the recreational use and commercial sale of marijuana in New Hampshire by adults passed its first test in the New Hampshire House of Representatives on Wednesday, in a bipartisan 209-147 vote.The bill now moves to the House Ways and Means Committee, given its financial implications, and will return to the House for a second vote after that committee files its recommendation.The House passed a legalization bill last year on the first vote, but it died in Ways and Means. Gov. Chris Sununu has promised a veto of the bill, HB 481. A two-thirds vote in House and Senate would be needed to override, and Wednesday’s vote did not come close to those numbers.The bill came to the House floor with a 10-9 vote of “ought to pass” by the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee. That close vote, with Republicans and Democrats on both sides of the issue, was a preview of Wednesday’s floor debate.“Despite our centuries of experience with marijuana we have a dearth of hard data regarding long-term effects of marijuana on the human body,” said Rep. Skip Berrien, D-Exeter.“I accept that no one has died of a marijuana overdose, but we do not know the long-term effects and social consequences of marijuana use. We know it’s not good for the developing brain of a fetus, children and youth. This should cause us to be hesitant as we approach this consideration on legalization.”He described legalization is “an experiment to determine what harm marijuana will cause in our communities and our children are the subjects of this long-term experiment.”“It puts our children at risk,” he said. “I say this is not the New Hampshire way.”Supporters of legalization said the question is not whether marijuana is harmless, but whether it should be illegal with all the associated consequences for users.“We’re not here to decide if marijuana is good or bad. We’re here to decide if it should be legal or illegal, which is another thing entirely,” said Rep. Carol McGuire, R-Merrimack.“Whether we think it’s good or bad, there’s no doubt a significant number of people in our state, our constituents and neighbors, want to use it, and many want to use it so much that they are willing to go to great lengths to get it.”Rep. Patrick Abrami, R-Stratham, who chaired the 17-member commission that spent a year studying the issue, argued against the bill. “There is no societal need or benefit from cannabis and this level of THC, there are only downside risks and costs to society,” he said.The 27-page bill leans heavily on the work of the commission comprised of various lawmakers and stakeholders that met 26 times in 2018 before issuing a final report in November.David Meuse, D-Portsmouth, said legalization would improve safety for the thousands of marijuana users in the state by establishing product testing and labeling, while helping to prevent interactions with drug dealers.“If you vote ‘no’ you will be voting to keep black market drug dealers in business; you’ll also be voting ‘no’ to new revenue that would provide drug education to kids and additional resources to law enforcement.”The bill states that cannabis will be legal for a person 21 years of age or older and taxed in a manner similar to alcohol. It lays out protocols for regulation, taxation, personal and commercial cultivation, retail sales, local control and distribution of the revenue — all under the purview of a Cannabis Control Commission.The legal possession limit would be one ounce in plant form, five grams of hashish or six cannabis plants, and consumption would be prohibited by anyone in a moving vehicle or public place.If the bill becomes law, the control commission will be required to start processing applications for retail locations by September 2020, and issue decisions within 90 days. That means the earliest pot shops could open in the Granite State would be January 2021.Cities and towns will be authorized to enact ordinances prohibiting or restricting the number of cannabis operations, controlling the location, size and hours of operation.A $30 per ounce wholesale tax paid by retailers would generate an estimated $33 million for the state, which could be higher or lower depending on actual sales volume. The bill avoids any retail sales tax, thus sidestepping the legal question of imposing a sales tax in a state that doesn’t have one.Only 33 percent of the proceeds from pot sales would go to the state general fund. The rest would be shared by health and human services agencies for research and education, law enforcement and public safety agencies, and municipalities that host retail or cultivation sites.dsolomon@unionleader.com"
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,Dave Solomon's State House Dome: House faces big bills this week,"Feb 24, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/politics/statehouse_dome/dave-solomon-s-state-house-dome-house-faces-big-bills/article_0b50da8a-b99e-5ce3-8610-905ef0156a6b.html,"IT MAY BE school vacation week in New Hampshire, but there’s no vacation for the House of Representatives.The Senate has no hearings or voting sessions scheduled for the week ahead, but House lawmakers have a busy docket, with a full slate of hearings on Tuesday and voting sessions scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday.All bills subject to review by a second committee must clear their first House vote by the end of the day Thursday, according to the House calendar. That means some of the most controversial initiatives of the session will face their first major test, including legalization of recreational cannabis, paid family medical leave, changes to school funding and gun-free school zones.The House Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee engaged in a heated debate on Thursday, surrounded by spectators, as they voted 10-9 to endorse HB 481, legalizing and regulating cannabis for sale to adults.The close committee vote is not necessarily a reflection of how the bill will fare in the 400-member House, which voted 207-139 in favor of legalization last January.If the bill clears Thursday’s vote, it will be handed off to House Ways and Means, where it died last year. Gov. Chris Sununu has promised to veto any legalization bill.Some form of paid family medical leave insurance is likely to emerge from the Legislature, with three proposals in play — one from the House, one from the Senate and one from Sununu.The House bill, HB 712, has a lot in common with its Senate counterpart, SB 1. Both call for withholding 0.5 percent of wages (an average of $5 per week) for a program that would provide 60 percent wage replacement for up to 12 weeks of leave annually.Sununu has proposed an entirely different approach, in partnership with Vermont. The two states would offer paid family leave as a fully funded benefit for state employees, in the hope that the risk pool would be large enough to attract private insurance companies to offer the benefit as a form of short-term disability coverage to non-government workers.The Senate version already passed that chamber in a party-line vote and is scheduled for a hearing in the House on Tuesday.It’s all moving a bit too fast for Republicans, who point out that it’s unusual for the House to start taking up Senate bills so early in the January-to-June session.“I can’t believe that with all of the other business we have to complete, that the House would want or need to schedule a public hearing and begin work on this very complex legislation,” said House Minority Leader Dick Hinch of Merrimack.“I can’t believe we’re diverting resources and time to this legislation during such a busy week dealing with House bills. The House has yet to act on the House version of this legislation, and they’re already scheduling a public hearing on the Senate version. I just can’t see the reasoning. Where has process and common sense gone?”A bill Sununu alluded to in his second inaugural address, regarding suicide prevention, will also be up for a vote.HB 652, known as the Jason Flatt Act, requires every public school teacher, supervisor and administrator to take at least two hours of training in suicide awareness and prevention annually. The original bill was amended to extend the training to other school personnel, bus drivers and students.The bill came out of the House Education Committee following a 19-0 vote.The amendment to extend the training to students addresses one of the concerns raised by suicide prevention advocates, many of whom favor the Senate version of suicide prevention, SB 282. That bill requires school districts and chartered public schools to develop a policy for preventing, assessing risk, and responding to student suicide.It also requires training for faculty, staff, students and school volunteers on suicide prevention.“We believe that true success with suicide prevention can only happen if the students have the tools to prevent suicide, too,” says Tara Holmes Ball, board president of Connor’s Climb Foundation, which has provided suicide education at no cost to more than 60 schools.“The Flatt Act is a good start but just a Band-Aid, and you cannot fix a broken bone with a Band-Aid.”"
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,Paul Feely's City Hall: Latest huddle on homeless issue frustrates Baines,"Feb 24, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/politics/city_hall/paul-feely-s-city-hall-latest-huddle-on-homeless-issue/article_3f973737-43b0-5e44-b1e2-b6ea5891b3ef.html,"Another closed-door discussion on handling homelessness in the Queen City has opened the door to additional frustration among city officials.Ward 3 Alderman Tim Baines surprised some during last week’s meeting of the Board of Mayor and Aldermen when he asked that his proposal to allow downtown business owners to control the use of the sidewalks outside their storefronts year-round remain tabled.At the suggestion of City Solicitor Emily Rice, aldermen went into nonpublic session to receive advice from counsel and hear information on homeless-related legislation such as “no sitting on the sidewalk” ordinances, also known as “sit-lie” laws because they prohibit sitting and lying down. When the board came back into open session to adjourn for the night, Baines’ proposal remained tabled for a second straight meeting.Baines, owner of Mint Bistro on Elm Street, believes his ordinance change could help business owners dealing with concerns raised by customers over the number of homeless outside businesses.Encumbrance permits are issued to businesses between April 1 and Oct. 15 to control the use of sidewalk space outside their businesses, as needed. Baines is looking to have the date restrictions removed, saying the change would allow business owners to maintain control of the immediate area outside their doors.Following last week’s board meeting Baines sent an email to fellow aldermen that stressed the need for the board to take some — any — action.“The situation going on in and around the downtown did not happen overnight and it will not be solved overnight either,” Baines wrote. “What I do know is that doing nothing is no longer an option. Citizens of Manchester from every ward in the city like to enjoy our downtown and I believe it is the duty of this board to ensure a safe environment.”Baines writes that before the-now SNHU Arena opened in 2001, “most of Elm Street was boarded up.”“Building owners would rent to any potential tenant, many of which ended up being treatment facilities and social service organizations,” Baines wrote. “With the arena, ballpark, a revitalized Palace Theatre, and investments by restaurateurs and shop owners, downtown Manchester came alive again.”Baines points out that two new hotels are in the process of being built, coupled with the projects like the revitalization of The Rex Theatre are signs people continue to want to invest in the Elm Street corridor.“I do not believe that business as usual or pointing to the fact there are similar issues going on elsewhere helps the cause,” Baines wrote. “City leaders past and present have raved about the success of Safe Station and it has become a national model in some ways. While this is great, we have to talk about the unintended consequences as well. The ACLU is focused on Manchester and has shook some to their core in a way that has empowered those causing trouble, while the rest of the community suffers.”In his email, Baines said aldermen may have to make “tough decisions” when it comes to these issues because “the same old safe approach will not continue to work.”“Whether we like it or not, Manchester is a magnet for those suffering with addiction,” Baines wrote. “We are not serving these individuals best when all of their services are located in and around the downtown, where temptation is everywhere.”Baines said the downtown is at a critical crossroads.“We are close to seeing businesses shut their doors because they cannot sustain the hits from the amount of people no longer willing to brave the elements downtown,” Baines said. “The eyes of the nation are about to be on Manchester and I hope we can work toward solutions and that our community can be viewed in a positive light. We can work together in finding Manchester solutions to this difficult problem.”Reached after last week’s meeting, Baines said he emerged from the nonpublic session frustrated.“I’m not looking for a fight with the ACLU but I think there should be a conversation with the full board,” Baines said.He said he plans to have his proposal come off the table at the board’s next meeting.Baines attended last week’s inaugural meeting of the Mayor’s Task Force on Homelessness, a new initiative from Mayor Joyce Craig.“This was a very good group of leaders in the community,” Baines said. “I think the dialogue was good. It was helpful and I’m anxious to see going forward if we can come up with workable solutions.”A new education initiative from Gov. Chris Sununu to incentivize learning outside the classroom is being roundly criticized by teachers unions, but the proposal has at least one prominent fan in the Queen City — Superintendent of School Dr. Bolgen Vargas.State education officials say the “Learn Everywhere” program will give students high school credit for completing internships and other after-school activities. Educators have aired concerns about the initiative, claiming a work-based program run by the state could adversely impact local programs.Doug Ley, president of the American Federation of Teachers–New Hampshire, last week offered personal testimony against the Learn Everywhere proposal.“As currently outlined, the Learn Everywhere program removes from local control the decisions regarding standards for credit-bearing activities and courses, thereby reversing longstanding New Hampshire tradition,” Ley said in a written statement. “As an organization representing educators who work closely with local administrators and school boards, AFT-NH rejects the centralization of authority over graduation standards and supports keeping it at the level closest to students, teachers, and citizens—the local level.”In a letter dated Feb. 12 to the state Board of Education, Vargas champions the proposal as an opportunity for districts like Manchester to “expand and foster the opportunity for learning.”“The Manchester School District strives to help every student succeed and thrive in the way that works for them,” Vargas wrote. “Students participate in a wide variety of educational experiences outside of the school day and the four walls of the schools. The Manchester School District welcomes a simplified process that identifies these programs by allowing the programs to be approved at the state level. By doing so, the State will be recognizing and further encouraging the efforts of local districts, such as Manchester, to engage students in rigorous and innovative learning outside of school.”Vargas goes on to say he is excited to see “what the program can bring to Manchester students” and urges board members to approve the proposal and Ed 1400 administrative rules.A ribbon-cutting ceremony has been scheduled for early May to reveal a bench in the Millyard honoring the longtime Queen City resident who invented the home video game.In the mid 1960s, Ralph Baer and a small group of engineers at Sanders Associates — which later became BAE Systems — pioneered video game technology. They eventually licensed the technology to Magnavox, which produced and marketed the Odyssey in 1972, the world’s first video game console.Baer started his career as an engineer and inventor after escaping Nazi Germany and fighting in World War II. After a brief stay in New York, Baer moved to Manchester in the 1950s, where he would live until his death in 2014 at age 92.Baer had more than 150 United States and foreign patents, and his contributions ranged from talking doormats and greeting cards to submarine tracking systems. In 2006, President George W. Bush awarded him the National Medal of Technology. In 2010, he was admitted to the National Inventors Hall of Fame.Baer’s son, Mark, has been working with local entrepreneurs Jeremy and Elizabeth Hitchcock, John Clayton of the Manchester Historical Association and Dan Berube of the Manchester Arts Commission on a Kickstarter campaign to fund the building of a bench in his father’s honor.Recently the Baer Square fundraising committee announced the official ribbon-cutting celebrating the unveiling of Baer Square will take place on Friday, May 10.The commemorative bench is expected to feature a likeness of Baer sitting with his “signature brown box,” the early gaming console he and his team developed. The bench will be located at Arms Park, on the end of Stark Street facing the water and in front of the Millyard.One final item this week: Craig will deliver her FY 2020 budget address on Wednesday Mar. 27 at 6 p.m. in the aldermanic chambers at City Hall."
Chris,Sununu,NH,New Hampshire Union Leader,BIA Business Perspective: Don’t change course on business tax relief,"Feb 23, 2019",https://www.unionleader.com/news/business/bia-business-perspective-don-t-change-course-on-business-tax/article_6a761bf6-7968-57ce-af7d-9b0c43989c05.html,"Legislators in Concord are about to add another layer to the already challenging cost of doing business in New Hampshire by abandoning the last steps of modest reductions of the state’s two major business taxes.In 2015, the Business Profits Tax (New Hampshire’s corporate income tax), an assessment on all profits earned by a business, was 8.5 percent. The Business Enterprise Tax, which is primarily based on total compensation businesses pay employees, was 0.75 percent. The state’s corporate taxes were among the highest in the country. Combined with one of the nation’s highest energy costs, a limited labor market and high housing costs, legislators will be making it more difficult to attract new companies and retain those already doing business in the state.Recognizing the economy was improving and wanting to stimulate further growth, the Democratic governor and Republican Legislature at the time agreed to reduce business tax rates in small steps over several years. For the taxable period ending in 2016, the BPT went down to 8.2 percent. For 2018, it went down to 7.9 percent, and for taxable year 2019 the rate is 7.7 percent. The BET also went from 0.75 percent to 0.72 percent, then 0.675 percent, and to 0.6 percent in taxable year 2019. (How businesses set their fiscal year and whether they pay quarterly are left to their discretion, but all businesses operating in New Hampshire pay one or both of these taxes.)To ensure the cuts wouldn’t leave the state short, the first two tax reductions were contingent on meeting established revenue thresholds. If too few taxes were collected and the thresholds were not attained, the rate reductions would be reset.The final tax reductions are scheduled for 2021, when the BPT rate will be 7.5 percent and the BET 0.5 percent. However, there is a move at the State House to squash this tax relief already written into law and already factored by businesses when calculating their future operational costs. A pair of bills would “freeze” these tax rates at the 2018 level (7.9 percent/0.675 percent).However, since we’re already in 2019, it’s not a freeze but a tax hike. Both HB 623 and SB 301 will raise business taxes. A third bill, SB 135, takes a slightly different approach. Like the other two bills it rolls back business tax rates to the 2018 level, but instead of freezing them at those rates, the bill suspends the final two business tax reductions for two years.One could infer that reversing agreed-upon tax rates must be the result of some fiscal calamity. Ironically, business tax revenues are not down; they’re up! New Hampshire has a very large surplus in business tax revenue, even with the BPT and BET reductions (or perhaps because of them). State revenue reports show that even with the lower rates, New Hampshire collected nearly $114 million more in business tax revenue than anticipated last fiscal year. After the first seven months of this fiscal year, the state is already $143 million over projections. In fact, total revenue exceeding projections since FY 2016 is $406 million.If the tax receipts are still flowing in, even stronger than before, why is the Legislature seeking to go back on its word to businesses? Perhaps a clue lies within the way proponents talk about the rate reduction. More than one policy leader has characterized them as “tax cuts for large out-of-state corporations.”Notwithstanding the fact that “out-of-state corporations” like BAE Systems, Whelen Engineering, Liberty Mutual Insurance and hundreds of others are some of the most attractive employers in the state, seeking to position tax relief as solely going to large employers to the exclusion of our small businesses is disingenuous. By raising business tax rates, hundreds of small businesses up and down every Main Street in New Hampshire will also be harmed.Some are also dismissive of the over-performance of business tax revenue, claiming it’s a one-time bump from recent federal tax reform. While those cuts probably had some impact, New Hampshire business tax revenues have been exceeding projections since 2016, long before the federal cuts were signed into law.In his recent budget address Gov. Chris Sununu said, “It is irresponsible governance for the Legislature to pingpong core tax policies every two years.” We agree. The state made a promise to businesses. The state ought to keep it.Collectively, we need to keep the New Hampshire economy strong with businesses growing, paying fair taxes, and attracting new business to the state. This will gain the revenues to grow the state, not place an undue burden on existing companies to carry the weight and fold under the pressure."
