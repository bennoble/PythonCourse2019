Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Editorial: Nothing says 'pro-life' like prosecuting the victim for being shot while pregnant,"Jul 1, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-nothing-says-pro-life-like-prosecuting-the-victim-for/article_e73e9589-d39f-5d1a-8294-4507c0380218.html,"It was only a matter of time before the national debate over fetal rights and abortion would lead to this: A woman in Alabama has been charged with manslaughter for allegedly being involved in an argument in December that ended when another woman shot her in the stomach. The victim was five months pregnant and lost her baby. The shooter has walked free.The charges, filed last week, focus new scrutiny on Alabama over a new law that treats doctors who perform abortions as Class A felons subject to potential life imprisonment. The law bans abortions at any stage of pregnancy. Missouri Gov. Mike Parson signed a law in May criminalizing abortions beyond eight weeks of pregnancy, with doctors subject to between five and 15 years of imprisonment.Although women who seek abortions aren’t subject to prosecution under the new Alabama law, existing law defines “an unborn child in utero at any stage of development, regardless of viability as a person and human being for purposes of the state laws dealing with murder, manslaughter, criminally negligent homicide, and assault.”

Against that backdrop, some zealous prosecutors and law enforcers undoubtedly feel they have a green light to determine motive and culpability when a pregnant woman is involved in situations that endanger the life of her fetus. Women are at increasing risk of becoming legally defined as mere reproductive vessels, with their own rights becoming subservient to those of the unborn.Details of the Alabama case are not entirely clear. Marshae Jones, 27, of Birmingham, was five months pregnant when she got into an argument with Ebony Jemison, 23, regarding the unborn baby’s father. Jemison told BuzzFeed News that she tried to get away when the argument became too heated, but Jones allegedly persisted. Jemison got into her own car, grabbed a gun and shot Jones in the stomach.
“The investigation showed that the only true victim in this was the unborn baby,” the website AL.com quoted Pleasant Grove, Ala., police Lt. Danny Reid as saying in December. He added ominously: “It was the mother of the child who initiated and continued the fight, which resulted in the death of her own unborn baby.”
Jemison was originally charged with manslaughter in December, but a grand jury declined to indict her. The grand jury later indicted Jones.It’s a patently ludicrous case. Prosecutors effectively must argue in court that Jemison had no other choice than to shoot Jones, though no life-threatening conditions appeared to exist. Far more difficult will be proving that Jones knew she would be shot if she persisted in confronting Jemison.The case opens vast new avenues for prosecutors to go after pregnant women who smoke, drink, jaywalk, jog or even travel in a car that later is involved in an accident. This is exactly where “pro-life” zealotry is leading."
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Order allows abortions at Planned Parenthood clinic in St. Louis until at least Aug. 1,"Jun 28, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/order-allows-abortions-at-planned-parenthood-clinic-in-st-louis/article_f9024fb2-5dc1-570c-8627-3f2ed91bf430.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — The Missouri Administrative Hearing Commission on Friday issued an order allowing Planned Parenthood to continue performing abortions at its Reproductive Health Services clinic in St. Louis for the foreseeable future.Commissioner Sreenivasa Rao Dandamudi granted Planned Parenthood’s motion for a stay, which will allow abortions to continue at least until he hears the case later this year. The next administrative hearing is scheduled for Aug. 1.Planned Parenthood “has an active license that shall remain in effect for the pendency of RHS’ (Reproductive Health Services’) case at the Commission,” he wrote.

The order represents a victory for Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region and Southwest Missouri, which is seeking to continue abortion services in St. Louis despite action from the state Department of Health and Senior Services, or DHSS. The state is seeking to stop abortions there over concerns about patient safety.“We are relieved to have this last-minute reprieve, which means patients can continue accessing safe, legal abortion at Planned Parenthood in St. Louis for the time being,” Dr. Colleen McNicholas, a clinic obstetrician/gynecologist, said in a statement. “This has been a week-to-week fight for our patients and every Missourian who needs access to abortion care.”

On June 21, the DHSS denied Planned Parenthood’s application to continue abortion services at its clinic on Forest Park Avenue, citing a series of deficiencies there.But, the clinic was allowed to continue abortion services through Friday because of an order issued last week by St. Louis Circuit Judge Michael Stelzer. In his order, Stelzer said the state Administrative Hearing Commission, or AHC, which handles bureaucratic disputes, should review the case.Dr. Randall Williams, DHSS director, on Friday referred questions about the case to the attorney general’s office.“We’re currently reviewing the AHC’s decision closely to determine next steps,” said Chris Nuelle, spokesman for Attorney General Eric Schmitt, a Republican.McNicholas said the biggest effects from Friday’s decision will be on the St. Louis clinic’s patients. During weeks of legal uncertainty, staff employees had to call women each day to tell them whether their appointments would stand.McNicholas was in the St. Louis clinic Friday when news of the decision was announced to clinic staff.“There were cheers and even some tears,” she said, adding that the decision is “a brief moment of celebration, but now back to work both for our patients and the larger cause.”In a filing earlier this week, Planned Parenthood attorneys argued the hearing commission should order the state to renew the clinic’s license.
“Petitioner affirmatively states that its renewal application was complete and that all of the applicable requirements for licensure have been met,” attorney Charles W. Hatfield wrote in a complaint filed Monday night. “Nothing in Missouri’s statutory or regulatory scheme provides any basis or justification for Respondent’s asserted grounds for license denial.”The state filed a brief in response denying the clinic’s claim that its action to deny the license was “arbitrary and capricious.”In denying Planned Parenthood’s license, Missouri cited inadequately supervised pelvic exams, failed surgical and medication abortions, untimely reporting of those failed procedures and poor communication with a contracted laboratory.The attorney general’s office argued the license denial was justified in part because Planned Parenthood had not made available five physicians whom the state wanted to interview concerning patients who had suffered complications.
“It is not arbitrary or capricious for the Department to request interviews with treating physicians in an investigation,” the state said in response to Planned Parenthood’s motion. “And it is not arbitrary or capricious for the Department to infer from the noncooperation of RHS and its physicians that they lack satisfactory explanations for their conduct,” the state said.Dandamudi, ruling on behalf of the entire four-member commission, wrote that the DHSS’ argument that it had to deny the license because it could not interview the physicians was “unpersuasive.”Because of Missouri law, according to DHSS, “it must deny RHS’ application because it cannot determine RHS complied with applicable statutes and regulations without the interviews it seeks. At this point, we find DHSS’ position unpersuasive,” the commission said.“Our review of the applicable statutes and rules finds no provision that affirmatively provides an obligation for DHSS to make, or RHS to procure, such interviews,” the commission said.The commission said the DHSS had cited other reasons for denying Planned Parenthood’s license, but that the crux of the health department’s justification in denying the license relied on the lack of physician interviews.“The absence of these interviews in itself does not constitute a failure to comply with licensure requirements,” the commission said.If the state ultimately succeeds in ending abortion services at the St. Louis clinic, Missouri would be the first state since the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, which legalized abortion nationwide, to not have at least one abortion clinic.Reproductive Health Services is the only clinic providing abortion services in operation in Missouri.Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican, last month signed a strict anti-abortion law that will ban the procedure at eight weeks of pregnancy, except in medical emergencies. The law takes effect Aug. 28.Erin Heffernan of the Post-Dispatch contributed to this report.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,St. Louis congressman pushes bill to allow cities to pass their own gun laws,"Jun 28, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/st-louis-congressman-pushes-bill-to-allow-cities-to-pass/article_654dead3-3082-5a27-878e-26748e83ca23.html,"ST. LOUIS — U.S. Rep. William Lacy Clay, D-University City, announced a federal bill Friday that would allow local governments, including St. Louis, to pass stricter gun laws without approval from a state legislature.Clay announced the effort at St. Louis Children’s Hospital, which treats more gunshot wounds than almost any children’s hospital in the country. He was joined by St. Louis Mayor Lyda Krewson, city Public Safety Director Jimmie Edwards and local hospital and nonprofit leaders.The bill is the latest effort to address gun violence, what the mayor calls one of the city’s most critical issues, and comes after several unusually violent weeks in St. Louis that saw five children or teens killed by gunshot wounds in the city this June.

Clay’s bill — H.R. 3435, the Local Public Health and Safety Protection Act — attempts to address the problem by forcing states to allow local governments to pass their own gun laws, even if they are stricter than state laws. Any state that receives federal public safety funding would need to comply.“I’m tired of the violence,” Clay said at the Friday press conference. “I’m tired of the excuses. And I’m tired of our state Legislature being unable or just too frightened to do something about gun violence.”Cities in 43 states, including Missouri, are prohibited from enacting their own gun laws by state statute today, Clay said. He argued the legislation is needed in cities like St. Louis, which has for years been ranked among the most violent cities in America.“Unless we get control of the flow of unrestricted guns into our community, we are not going to solve this problem,” he said.The legislation has 20 co-sponsors in the U.S. House, but faces dim prospects of becoming federal law any time soon. It would need approval from the Republican-controlled U.S. Senate that, according to Clay, is “captive” to gun rights advocates at the National Rifle Association.Krewson said if the city got the power to write its own gun laws, her top priority would be to require a permit to carry a gun, reversing a vote by the Missouri Legislature to abolish the state’s concealed carry permits in 2016.“This has become so much more of a crisis in the last few years because Missouri no longer requires gun owners to carry a permit,” Krewson said after the news conference Friday. “So that’s the first step. So then if a law enforcement officer stops you with a gun they can ask, ‘Let me see your permit.’”
Edwards, the public safety director, said Friday that without local control over gun laws, the city’s police department has taken other routes to controlling the use of guns including referring more weapons cases to federal agencies and taking guns from minors through child safety laws.Gov. Mike Parson’s office did not respond to a request for comment on the legislation Friday. Statewide gun rights advocates at the Missouri Firearms Coalition argue the bill would overly restrict gun rights while doing little to curb the city’s violence.“There have been so many bills hyped as a magical cure to gun violence,” said Aaron Dorr, policy adviser for the Missouri Firearms Coalition. “And instead they are used to demonize and prosecute law-abiding gun owners and ignore the criminals that are actually committing the crimes.”Clay acknowledged Friday that city gun laws wouldn’t be a cure-all to the crime problem.
“This is a sliver of what we need, but at least it gives us another tool,” he said.But hospital leaders at the press conference Friday supported the bill, arguing they see the effects of the city’s gun violence firsthand.So far in 2019, more than 40 children have been treated at St. Louis Children’s Hospital with critical or fatal injuries from gunshot wounds, said the hospital’s chief medical officer, Alexis Elward.Medical professionals at the hospital routinely operate on toddlers riddled with bullets and treat children shot while walking to the bus stop or playing in the front yard, Elward said.“But there is nothing routine or natural about it,” Elward said. She added: “For the healthcare professionals here this is not political. This is not just professional. It’s intensely personal.”Jack Suntrup of the Post-Dispatch contributed to this report.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Controversy, complaints about secrecy have followed Missouri's top health official","Jun 27, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/controversy-complaints-about-secrecy-have-followed-missouri-s-top-health/article_35b45cb6-e0f1-5735-accd-ba4a5efcf3fd.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — Missouri’s top health official, a licensed obstetrician/gynecologist, is the face of the state’s effort to end abortions at the only clinic in Missouri that performs them.Dr. Randall Williams, a holdover from former Gov. Eric Greitens’ administration, is the expert Gov. Mike Parson leans on to explain why officials believe Planned Parenthood should be barred from terminating pregnancies at its Central West End clinic.The abortion issue has put Williams, director of the state’s Department of Health and Senior Services, front and center in a debate that coincides with Parson, a Republican, signing legislation last month that will prohibit women from terminating their pregnancies after eight weeks, except in medical emergencies.

Williams anticipated criticism when he took the job as state health director in 2017, he said in response to written questions from the Post-Dispatch.“Our job is to ensure the nearly 4,000 licensed health facilities are complying with current Missouri laws and regulations,” Williams said. “As for feedback, both positive and negative, I try to use it to help make us better at serving the people of Missouri.“I also remember an old adage from my many years in court as an expert witness: If the facts are on your side, argue the facts; and if the facts are not on your side, impugn people’s motives. So I am discerning in interpreting some people’s motives when they provide feedback.”Williams did not address his own views on abortion, saying only, “Abortion is legal in Missouri, and I want it to be safe.”He wasn’t always a bureaucrat. From 1989 until 2015 he was an obstetrician in private practice in Raleigh, North Carolina. In that role, he says, he delivered more than 2,000 babies.In 2011, Williams was a candidate for mayor of Raleigh, but came in last in the three-way, nonpartisan race. News reports at the time said Williams was a Republican who had supported President Barack Obama.After Patrick McCrory was elected governor of North Carolina in 2013, Williams served on his transition team for health care issues. In 2015, he was named health director in North Carolina.After two sometimes turbulent years, Williams came to Missouri in 2017 as Greitens assembled his cabinet.Since his arrival, Williams has been among the most high-profile agency directors, primarily because he has generated controversy as the head of a department that licenses health care facilities, tracks the spread of disease and is setting up the state’s medical marijuana program.

With the clamor over the new abortion law still reverberating, a St. Louis judge issued an order this month allowing Missouri’s only abortion clinic to remain open amid a battle over the facility’s license.That order expires on Friday, but meanwhile, Planned Parenthood has appealed the license denial to the state’s Administrative Hearing Commission, where the judge said the matter belonged.Planned Parenthood has asked the commission to allow it to continue abortions until at least Aug. 1, when the state and the clinic are scheduled to meet for a hearing.The dispute centers around the results of a two-month state investigation into Planned Parenthood’s St. Louis clinic. The state has outlined 30 deficiencies at the clinic, and it says the clinic has addressed a handful to the state’s satisfaction.The deficiencies cited included inadequately supervised pelvic exams, failed surgical and medication abortions, untimely reporting of those failed procedures and poor communication with a contracted laboratory.The state said some problems noted in the investigation caused “serious patient harm.”In response, Planned Parenthood officials accused Parson’s administration of politicizing state health regulations to restrict access to legal abortions in Missouri.Williams says politics have nothing to do with his department’s decision to revoke the license of the St. Louis clinic.“There is no influence that is exerted or accepted in those areas, whether it be from the governor or the Legislature,” he said.He also denied trying to discourage medication abortions by requiring pelvic exams before prescribing the pills. Planned Parenthood argues the exams are medically unnecessary in most cases, but Williams has said they are standard medical practice.Missouri residentWillams, 62, often wears a bow tie and likes to talk about running. According to his biography, he has run marathons in Boston, New York, Paris and Jerusalem, among other locations.He has kept a home in North Carolina, where his wife, Elizabeth Williams, still lives and works. In Jefferson City, he lives in an apartment near the Capitol. He said he votes and pays taxes in Missouri.Early in the morning, he often takes his dog Mo and sets off across the Missouri River bridge for a run. He says the Katy Trail is among his favorite places in Missouri.“I love my run in the morning,” Williams said.But his time in the capital city hasn’t always been tranquil.Williams has sparred with lawmakers on a number of occasions, including in July 2018 when House budget writers scolded him for bungling a program that helps get stroke and heart attack patients to the most appropriate facility in the shortest amount of time.
The dust-up came after Parson vetoed $153,000 from the program, setting off alarm bells that the program might be discontinued.Williams said the veto was a way to force hospitals to pay more to fund the program. He and Parson attempted to play down potential problems, arguing that their maneuver would not result in a break in service.Lawmakers said they were misled about the intent of the veto.Williams also was targeted by the House budget panel after he refused to release information about an outbreak of the tick-borne Bourbon virus.In blocking the release of information, Williams cited confidentiality laws. Lawmakers responded by cutting eight positions in his agency’s budget.Williams has been accused of being too secretive on other issues, as well.This year, Cole County Circuit Judge Patricia Joyce said the health department must release the results of lab tests related to 2017 protests in downtown St. Louis.The judge wrote that Williams’ agency violated open records laws when it refused to release lab tests of a liquid that St. Louis County police said was thrown at officers during protests, which were sparked by the acquittal of former police Officer Jason Stockley on a murder charge for the fatal shooting of Anthony Lamar Smith.The judge ordered the state to pay the ACLU of Missouri, which sought the records, $10,754 in fines and legal fees.The liquid was identified by police as apple cider vinegar.
Joyce’s ruling came two days after the Post-Dispatch filed a lawsuit against the agency for refusing to release records showing who is seeking to sell and grow medical marijuana in Missouri.The department says the constitutional amendment that legalized medical marijuana forbids the release of the records.Circuit Judge Daniel R. Green ruled in the Post-Dispatch’s favor last week.The department also eliminated geographic details from its reporting of West Nile virus cases, citing privacy concerns.“One of our agency’s top priorities is to follow the law and provide transparency and access to public information while using an abundance of caution to follow the law and protect confidential information,” Williams said.N.C. controversyThe controversies Williams has faced in Missouri were foreshadowed during his tenure in North Carolina.In 2016, the state’s toxicologist testified in a lawsuit that Williams and other environmental officials attempted to “play down the risk” of coal ash contamination of drinking wells by rescinding a do-not-drink notice.The toxicologist said in a deposition that the state was telling people the water was safe when it knew it wasn’t.Williams said he rescinded the warning notices because they were stirring up unwarranted fears.“And that there was a concern that we had alarmed people disproportionate to the risk,” he said in a deposition.The dispute led to the resignation of at least one state health official, who said she couldn’t support how Williams had downplayed the risks.Williams’ actions became an issue when he was being confirmed in the Missouri Senate.“After Flint, Michigan,” said Senate Majority Leader Gina Walsh, “I just want to make sure things like that don’t happen in my state,” referring to Flint’s problems with lead in its water supply. “Is it not your job to enforce your own rules?”Williams ultimately was confirmed unanimously by the Senate.When asked this week if he planned to continue on in Missouri, Williams said he would.“I love Missouri, my colleagues, and the opportunity to help people and serve our great state.”

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Missouri Auditor Galloway, planning run for governor, asks Gov. Mike Parson to combat ‘dark money’","Jun 27, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-auditor-galloway-planning-run-for-governor-asks-gov-mike/article_39070652-d42e-5d92-913e-efb1d943a7bb.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — Auditor Nicole Galloway on Thursday issued an open letter to Gov. Mike Parson pressuring the governor to address the influence of so-called dark money in state government.Galloway, a Democrat who is preparing to launch a campaign for governor, said Parson, a Republican, could take executive actions that would address the perception of pay-to-play politics by groups that do not have to reveal the sources of their donations.The letter was the latest effort by Galloway to differentiate herself from Parson, whom she would likely face in next year’s gubernatorial election if both decide to run as expected. Parson’s office did not respond to a request for comment.

“You could issue an executive order immediately to ensure transparency when it comes to the role of dark money in securing government contracts,” Galloway said, adding that she had proposed legislation that would act as a framework for such an executive order.Her legislation, she said, would require people or businesses entering into a state contract for $5,000 or more to disclose payments over $500 annually to 501(c)(4) nonprofits, which do not have to reveal donors.Galloway, 37, was appointed state auditor in 2015 and narrowly won a four-year term last November. That means she could run against Parson, 63, next year without sacrificing her statewide office if she lost.Her letter comes a year after she sent a similar letter to Parson, days after former Gov. Eric Greitens left office and Parson was sworn in. Greitens’ 501(c)(4) nonprofit, A New Missouri, raised $6.1 million in contributions in 2017, and the identities of the vast majority of the nonprofit’s donors remain secret.In her 2019 letter, Galloway cited Kingdom Principles, a 501(c)(4) nonprofit that tried to alter how colleges and universities handle sexual assault claims, as a reason Parson should address dark money.
“Media reports uncovered a trail of correspondence strategizing about this matter between lawmakers and a lobbyist who formed the dark money group behind the legislation,” Galloway said.She also suggested a measure pending on Parson’s desk would create “the conditions for public corruption” if signed into law by reducing the number of requests for proposals advertised by the state and ultimately making the bidding process less competitive.
Among the provisions of House Bill 1088, nicknamed by proponents the “Million Dollar Boondoggle Act,” is one that she argued would make the “potential use” of shortlisting “discretionary to all state contracts.”Shortlisting is a method used by state entities to limit the number of businesses eligible to compete in the bidding process.In the 2018 letter, Galloway asked Parson to “resolve the specter of dark money and secret donors influencing government.”She said the Legislature should pass a law requiring 501(c)(4) nonprofits — such as A New Missouri — to disclose donors. Lawmakers did not approve that legislation during the last legislative session.Parson’s allies have not launched a 501(c)(4) nonprofit of their own. Instead, the governor has raised money for his election through a political action committee that files paperwork with the Missouri Ethics Commission.Unlike a traditional campaign account, his Uniting Missouri PAC can accept unlimited donations. But unlike a 501(c)(4) nonprofit, Parson must reveal the source of every donation.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri Auditor Nicole Galloway 'very serious' about running for governor next year,"Jun 26, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-auditor-nicole-galloway-very-serious-about-running-for-governor/article_11fe4575-fa0e-59e4-a673-bcbc47f41db7.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — Missouri Auditor Nicole Galloway is planning to run for governor next year, the executive director of the Missouri Democratic Party told the Post-Dispatch.""She's very serious about the race and is taking steps to assemble a team and the resources it would take to win,"" said Lauren Gepford, executive director of the state Democrats, adding that she did not know when Galloway would make a formal announcement.Galloway, a Democrat, won a four-year term as auditor in November after being appointed to the post in 2015 by then-Gov. Jay Nixon, a Democrat. She narrowly defeated Republican Saundra McDowell last year, winning 50.4% of the vote. 

Galloway's pending entrance into the race presents a dilemma for state Sen. Scott Sifton, D-south St. Louis County, who said earlier this year he intended to run for governor. He declined to comment for this article.If both did run, the two would face off in an August 2020 primary, which Democratic insiders would like to avoid.Sifton reported having $313,000 in his campaign coffers as of April 1. Galloway had $65,798 in her account after raising $114,194 in the first quarter.Galloway, 37, of Columbia, would be the first woman elected governor in Missouri if she were to win in November 2020. She would have to defeat Gov. Mike Parson, 63, to win the office.Parson, a Republican, has more than $3 million in campaign funds spread across two separate accounts. Parson ascended to the state's top job one year ago after then-Gov. Eric Greitens, a Republican, resigned after months of scandal.Before Greitens' election in 2016, Democrats controlled most statewide offices in Jefferson City.But as of this year, Galloway was the only Democrat left holding statewide office in Missouri.In the last several months, she has made moves to differentiate herself from Parson.
During her inaugural address in January, Galloway criticized the Parson administration's Department of Revenue for secrecy concerning a tax withholding error that sent jitters through state government. During the speech, Parson was sitting feet from Galloway's podium.“The administration might have been trying to sweep this under the rug, but I will hold them accountable to you,” Galloway said in her address. “Missourians deserve transparency.”In May, she needled Parson's office for citing the First Amendment to close public records, and asked a Parson ally, Attorney General Eric Schmitt, to issue an opinion on the legality of such a citation. Schmitt has yet to issue one.
She also criticized a new anti-abortion law Parson signed last month, which bans the procedure at eight weeks of pregnancy. ""He wants a woman’s decisions over her health care to be criminalized,"" Galloway said. ""It’s extreme and cruel.""Jean Evans, executive director of the Missouri Republican Party, said it was no surprise Galloway was preparing a run for governor.""She's been attacking the governor for a while so we knew she was running,"" Evans said. ""It's not news. I mean, it is. But it's not to us.""President Donald Trump won Missouri in 2016 by 19 percentage points. That said, Missouri Democrats running for U.S. Senate and governor that year lost by more narrow margins.Still, Evans predicted Parson, who was elected lieutenant governor in 2016, would win a full four-year term as governor. She cited economic growth and the governor's stable hand as reasons voters would give him another four years in office.""It doesn't matter if it's Nicole, Scott Sifton, or anyone else ... I think the governor matches what people want in Missouri,"" she said.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Execution date set for Missouri death row inmate convicted of 1996 murder,"Jun 25, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/execution-date-set-for-missouri-death-row-inmate-convicted-of/article_8f2c5427-bed3-5df0-bdef-f5f976f8dcba.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — The Missouri Supreme Court on Tuesday issued a warrant of execution for Russell Bucklew, who was convicted of killing a southeast Missouri man in 1996 during a crime rampage.The state’s high court set Bucklew’s execution date for Oct. 1.

The warrant comes after the U.S. Supreme Court in April ruled against Bucklew’s bid to halt his death by lethal injection. Attorneys for Bucklew, now 51, argued his medical condition would lead to extreme suffering when put to death by lethal injection.Bucklew’s medical condition, cavernous hemangioma, causes weakened and malformed blood vessels, and tumors in his nose and throat could rupture and bleed.

“The Eighth Amendment has never been understood to guarantee a condemned inmate a painless death,” Justice Neil Gorsuch said in April. “That’s a luxury not guaranteed to many people, including most victims of capital crimes.”Bucklew’s execution has been delayed numerous times in the 22 years since he was convicted of first-degree murder.In 1997, a Boone County jury recommended the death penalty for Bucklew after convicting him of killing Michael Sanders, 27, the boyfriend of Bucklew’s ex-girlfriend.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,License dispute over Missouri's last abortion clinic heads to state commission,"Jun 25, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/license-dispute-over-missouri-s-last-abortion-clinic-heads-to/article_ca7814b5-cee2-5e07-9e54-ac6738684981.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — Attorneys for Missouri’s only abortion clinic have asked a state panel to reverse a decision by regulators that would stop legal abortions in the state.On Friday, the state Department of Health and Senior Services denied Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region’s application to continue abortion services at its Central West End clinic, citing a series of deficiencies there.The clinic is allowed to continue abortion services through Friday because of an order by St. Louis Circuit Judge Michael Stelzer. In his order, Stelzer said the state Administrative Hearing Commission, which handles bureaucratic disputes, should review the case.

Attorneys for Planned Parenthood have asked the commission to conduct a hearing on the dispute. They asked the commission to force the state to re-license the clinic.“Petitioner affirmatively states that its renewal application was complete and that all of the applicable requirements for licensure have been met,” attorney Charles W. Hatfield wrote in a complaint filed Monday night. “Nothing in Missouri’s statutory or regulatory scheme provides any basis or justification for Respondent’s asserted grounds for license denial.”The case has been assigned to Commissioner Sreenivasa Rao Dandamudi, and the commission has set a hearing for Aug. 1 in St. Louis.Because Planned Parenthood is only authorized to perform abortions through Friday, its attorneys asked Dandamudi for an order allowing it to continue providing abortions until the commission reviews the case.
He is one of three judges on the Administrative Hearing Commission and was appointed by then-Gov. Jay Nixon, a Democrat, in 2010.
Dandamudi has also served as an assistant attorney general for Missouri and has worked as general counsel for the state Board of Registration for the Healing Arts.The fight before the Administrative Hearing Commission is the latest development in a licensing dispute that has drawn national attention.If Planned Parenthood’s St. Louis clinic is forced to stop providing abortions, Missouri would be the first state since 1974 to have no abortion clinic in operation.Beyond the licensing dispute, Missouri lawmakers this year approved a sweeping anti-abortion proposal that bans the procedure, in most cases, at eight weeks of pregnancy.Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican, signed the measure last month. Most of its provisions take effect in August.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Editorial: State's traffic-stop racial disparities suggest much work remains to be done,"Jun 25, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-state-s-traffic-stop-racial-disparities-suggest-much-work/article_61401f6b-89c9-552a-8ca9-2f945494bade.html,"Missouri appears to be working hard to maintain its NAACP designation as a state perhaps best avoided. The state attorney general’s office this month released its assessment of 2018 traffic stops by local police, and the results are dismal: Black drivers are on average 91 percent more likely than white motorists to be pulled over.Attorney General Eric Schmitt made no attempt to sugarcoat the statistics, which local law enforcement agencies are required to report. The racial breakdown of drivers involved in traffic stops helps authorities keep tabs on police jurisdictions where bias might play a role in law enforcement decisions.An elevated number of traffic stops doesn’t always signify racial bias. For example, cities with overwhelmingly dominant black populations in theory should have a number of traffic stops skewed toward blacks. The same should hold true of white drivers in heavily white-dominated cities.

But that’s not how the numbers worked out. Particularly in the St. Louis area, blacks are being stopped far out of proportion to their representation in the population. In St. Louis city, blacks were subjected to traffic stops at a rate six times higher than their representation in the population and were 16.5 times more likely to be stopped than whites. That’s bad news for a city already immersed in controversy over reports of overt racism within police ranks.In Bellefontaine Neighbors, blacks were stopped nearly 8.6 times more than their numbers are represented in the population. Whites were stopped less than one-tenth of their ratio in the population.
Statewide, there were a total of 1.54 million traffic stops, with most — 1.18 million or 76.5% — involving white drivers. The statewide driving population is 82.8% white. Blacks represent only 10.9% of the driving population but represented 19.2% of traffic stops.
Roughly 6.6% of cars and/or drivers were searched. Blacks and Hispanics statewide were subjected to far higher rates of search. Interestingly, however, blacks and Hispanics were less likely than whites to have possessed illegal items than whites, the report says.Although the details in Schmitt’s report were exhaustive, there is still room for improvement. Including the time of day when a stop was made, for example, has helped other states identify specific police departments suspected of persistent racial harassment. That’s based on statistics indicating that traffic stops involving blacks are demonstrably higher during daylight hours, when officers can see the race of the driver, versus nighttime when lighting makes racial distinctions more difficult to detect.The NAACP issued a travel advisory on Missouri in 2017, citing in part the high disparity in traffic stops between blacks and white. Since then, the disparities have worsened. If Gov. Mike Parson truly cares about the state’s reputation and its ability to attract new business, he should make reversing these numbers a top priority."

Eric Greitens took $50,000 from an organization affiliated with Charles Koch, a Kansas businessman and GOP mega-donor.Tax filings made by The Seminar Network Chamber of Commerce Inc. show the group donated the money in 2017 to A New Missouri, the “dark-money” outfit formed by allies of Greitens early that year to promote Greitens’ conservative agenda and personal brand.A New Missouri raised $6.1 million in 2017, but the sources of the vast majority of that war chest remain shrouded in secrecy because the 501(c)(4) nonprofit does not have to reveal its donors.

Because of tax filings made by The Seminar Network and one other organization, some information about A New Missouri’s fundraising has been made public.The Center for Responsive Politics revealed in May that A New Missouri also accepted $500,000 from the Judicial Crisis Network, an organization that promotes conservative judges.The Seminar Network’s donation to A New Missouri represented a small portion of the network’s overall activities in 2017, the filing shows.According to its tax filing, The Seminar Network also gave $47.5 million to Americans for Prosperity, a 501(c)(4) group that supports Republicans and which doesn’t have to reveal its donors.The Seminar Network Chamber of Commerce said in its tax filing that it was formed to “advance its members’ common business interests by advancing the principles of free markets and a free society.”Mark Holden is listed as The Seminar Network’s president. He is also the senior vice president of Koch Industries Inc. and is chairman of Americans for Prosperity Foundation, according to its website.
A New Missouri filed its own tax return — known as a Form 990 — late last year, several months after Greitens, a Republican, resigned following months of scandal.A New Missouri’s filing confirmed the organization received enough money in 2017 to rival the campaign accounts of statewide candidates. It shows that money flowed to political consulting firms tied to Greitens and his campaign — reinforcing concern over close ties between Greitens’ campaign and the nonprofit.Unlike a traditional state campaign committee, A New Missouri was able to accept unlimited campaign donations and was able to shield its donors.
In July, at the culmination of a monthslong Missouri House investigation into Greitens’ campaign apparatus, then-state Rep. Jay Barnes, R-Jefferson City, wrote in a complaint to the Missouri Ethics Commission that A New Missouri was formed to evade state campaign contribution limits and donor disclosure requirements.Indeed, the 67 donations recorded in the 990 filing all exceed $2,600 — the cap voters in 2016 placed on individual donations to candidates.The ethics complaint is still pending, and the ethics committee’s proceedings are private, meaning little is known about how the agency is handling Barnes’ complaint.Greitens’ successor, Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican, has avoided raising so-called “dark money.” Instead, his allies have used the Uniting Missouri PAC to raise money for Parson’s election in 2020.While the political action committee does not have to adhere to donation limits set in 2016, it does have to disclose its donors under Missouri law.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri's only abortion clinic can keep license through Friday as it appeals to state commission,"Jun 25, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/missouri-s-only-abortion-clinic-can-keep-license-through-friday/article_4b92137e-1a6e-55d0-a398-75657d7abeaa.html,"ST. LOUIS — A judge’s ruling Monday extended Planned Parenthood’s St. Louis clinic license through Friday, allowing Missouri’s only abortion clinic time to appeal to a state commission.


            Judge Michael Stelzer's ruling in Planned Parenthood v MissouriSt. Louis Circuit Judge Michael Stelzer extended his June 10 preliminary injunction through 5 p.m. Friday to give the clinic time to challenge the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services’ decision to deny its license to the Administrative Hearing Commission.

“The Court has no authority to intercede in this matter until there has been a final decision by the AHC,” Stelzer’s ruling said.Stelzer’s ruling also dismissed other counts in the lawsuit, removing the case from state courts and ordering that it be taken up with the AHC. The panel handles licensing disputes between state agencies, businesses and people.Earlier this month, Gov. Mike Parson appointed a former judge to the AHC who has supported an anti-abortion pregnancy center.The Missouri Supreme Court in 2015 reprimanded former Macon County Associate Circuit Judge Philip Prewitt for encouraging people to donate to local charities on Facebook, including Ray of Hope Pregnancy Care Ministries, an anti-abortion nonprofit.Prewitt said he would consider recusing himself if requested by a party in the case.“I don’t see where it would be a conflict,” Prewitt said. “It doesn’t violate the judicial rules, so I don’t see how it would violate any commissioner rules either.”Parson spokesman Steele Shippy said the governor named Prewitt to the commission based on his experience as a judge and his past military service and that his stance on abortion was not a factor.The four commissioners work independently, and cases are assigned on a rotating basis.Dr. Colleen McNicholas, an obstetrician-gynecologist at the St. Louis clinic, said in a statement Monday that the “terrifying reality is that access is hanging on by a thread with a narrowing timeline. The truth is, if the Administrative Hearing Commission does not act by Friday, abortion access in the state of Missouri will be gone. This creates uncertainty for the patients we serve.”A health department spokeswoman declined to comment Monday.Planned Parenthood had not appealed to the AHC as of 5 p.m. Monday, records show.If the commission sides with the state, Missouri could become the first U.S. state without an abortion clinic since the Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade decision in 1973 established a woman’s right to terminate her pregnancy.
The state license only affects abortion services. The clinic also provides routine medical care to men and women, cancer screenings, sexually transmitted disease tests, permanent birth control procedures and counseling.The state denied Planned Parenthood’s license last week, citing deficiencies from an investigation of the clinic this spring.

            DHSS license denial letter to Planned Parenthood


            DHSS 'Emergency Amendment' to licensing regulations



            DHSS notice of deficiencies in Planned Parenthood lawsuitIn denying Planned Parenthood’s license, Missouri cited inadequately supervised pelvic exams, failed surgical and medication abortions, untimely reporting of those failed procedures and poor communication with a contracted laboratory.The state investigation found four instances of incomplete surgical abortions, which may have been hindered by patients’ obesity or uterine malformations. One of the patients also experienced a failed medication abortion, according to the state’s report.Incomplete abortions are a rare complication occurring in fewer than 1% of all procedures.Planned Parenthood officials have accused Gov. Mike Parson’s administration of politicizing health regulations to restrict access to legal abortions in Missouri.In a statement issued Friday, Parson said “Planned Parenthood is losing its license because it failed to meet basic standards of care.”Planned Parenthood sued the department last month claiming the state agency had illegally refused to renew the St. Louis abortion clinic’s annual license amid an investigation into the clinic. The state says Planned Parenthood has failed to comply with regulations by not compelling five doctors who have worked at the clinic to be interviewed.In May, Parson signed one of the nation’s strictest abortion laws, banning the procedures after the eighth week of pregnancy. Most of the provisions in that law take effect Aug. 28.The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Fate of Missouri's only abortion clinic in hands of judge after state denies license,"Jun 22, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/fate-of-missouri-s-only-abortion-clinic-in-hands-of/article_2fadbd35-596b-57e8-9573-c02ea662acdc.html,"ST. LOUIS — Planned Parenthood will continue providing abortions at least until a St. Louis judge issues a ruling in the clinic’s legal battle with the state Department of Health and Senior Services, which on Friday declined to renew the facility’s license.


            DHSS license denial letter to Planned ParenthoodCircuit Judge Michael Stelzer said in a brief court hearing Friday that despite the state’s decision, the abortion clinic’s license remains valid because of his June 10 preliminary injunction preserving the license. 

“Planned Parenthood’s doors remain open,” M’Evie Mead, director of Planned Parenthood Advocates of Missouri, said after the hearing. “The judge left his injunction in place, which means that Missourians can continue to access the full range of reproductive health care in Missouri for now.”The fate of the license now rests with Stelzer, who said he would issue a ruling soon.If the state’s denial stands, Missouri would become the first U.S. state without an abortion clinic since the Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade decision in 1973 established a woman’s right to terminate her pregnancy. The denial means Planned Parenthood can appeal to a state licensing commission.The state license only affects abortion services. The clinic also provides routine medical care to men and women, cancer screenings, sexually transmitted disease tests, permanent birth control procedures and counseling.Dr. Randall Williams, director of the Department of Health and Senior Services, said at a news conference Friday in Gov. Mike Parson’s office that politics played no role in the state’s decision to deny the license and that the clinic had not corrected more than two dozen deficiencies state inspectors had identified earlier this year.

A key point of contention has been the state’s requirement of pelvic exams prior to an abortion. The clinic said a recent state requirement had compelled physicians to perform two pelvic exams before an abortion — one 72 hours prior, and the second the same day of the abortion.The department, however, said pelvic exams must be completed 72 hours prior to an abortion because of the state’s informed consent law, which says doctors must identify risks to a patient three days before an abortion.On Friday, a Planned Parenthood spokeswoman said the St. Louis clinic a day earlier had stopped performing pelvic exams three days before an abortion, instead resuming its practice of doing exams on the same day of abortions.Williams said his agency had issued a regulation that would allow Planned Parenthood to conduct pelvic exams when it sees fit.“I am issuing an emergency rule today that Planned Parenthood can defer the pelvic exam until the day of the surgery if in their estimation — using their clinical judgment — that they think there’s a medical reason that they should do that,” Williams said. “We do not want patients having two pelvic exams.”

Lisa Cox, spokeswoman for DHSS, said the state had not required two pelvic exams prior to an abortion. She said the disagreement over the timing of the exam is what led to physicians performing two pelvic exams.“We’ve never required two,” she said.Missouri health officials had asked Stelzer to reconsider his order allowing Missouri’s only abortion clinic to remain open through Friday. Health officials also filed records of its two-month investigation into the clinic noting “at least 30 deficiencies” that the state says must be corrected before the clinic’s license can be renewed.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Judge says Missouri should open some medical marijuana records,"Jun 22, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/judge-says-missouri-should-open-some-medical-marijuana-records/article_c90773fd-ed1c-5fc5-aab4-719458b6b7c8.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — A Cole County judge on Friday sided with the Post-Dispatch in a lawsuit challenging the state’s ability to keep secret the identities of those seeking to sell medical marijuana in Missouri.Circuit Judge Daniel R. Green overruled the state’s motion to dismiss the Post-Dispatch’s lawsuit. He granted the newspaper’s motion for summary judgment to force the state to release the records.“I think that tie goes to the runner in a Sunshine Law case,” Green said on Friday.

The state does not have to immediately produce the records because Green delayed the effective date of his order so the state could decide whether to appeal.Dr. Randall Williams, director of the Department of Health and Senior Services, which regulates medical marijuana, said Friday afternoon he had yet to meet with his legal team to decide the state’s next steps.“It’s always our intent to comply with the law,” Williams said. “The judge ruled, and unless there’s some compelling reason from the attorney general’s office or our lawyers I would think we would provide that information as quickly as we can.”“In its oral ruling, the Court acknowledged that the case was a close one,” said Lisa Cox, spokeswoman for DHSS. “The Department cannot comment on how it will proceed until a final written order is entered and reviewed.”The Post-Dispatch sued the DHSS in January, accusing the state agency of violating the Sunshine Law by closing the applicant identifying information.The department said the text of the constitutional amendment legalizing medical marijuana precluded the state from releasing such information, but Joseph Martineau of Lewis Rice, an attorney for the Post-Dispatch, argued the state was relying on an “overly restrictive interpretation” of the amendment to close the records.The Missouri attorney general’s office moved to dismiss the case, while the Post-Dispatch filed a motion for summary judgment, seeking release of the records.The amendment voters approved in November says, in part, that the department “shall maintain the confidentiality of reports or other information obtained from an applicant or licensee containing any individualized data, information, or records related to the licensee or its operation … .”“(T)he provision does not say that the Department ‘shall maintain the confidentiality of the applicant or licensee‘ as well as the reports or other information obtained from the applicant or licensee,” Martineau wrote in the Post-Dispatch’s lawsuit.
Martineau wrote the state’s interpretation “is flawed, unsupported by the language of the provision, contrary to the provision’s intent, and disregards the important public policy that the process of applying for and awarding licenses to manufacture, distribute and dispense marijuana should be open and transparent.”State attorneys argued Green should apply a “traditional constitutional interpretation” to the constitutional clause that says the state should “maintain the confidentiality of … any information.”“The Post-Dispatch’s position is untenable and cannot be allowed to prevail over the will of Missouri voters and the plain language of the Constitutional provision they adopted overwhelmingly,” the state said.Missouri is required by law to approve at least 60 commercial growers, 86 facilities that manufacture marijuana-infused products and 192 dispensary licenses — 24 dispensaries for each of Missouri’s eight congressional districts.
As of late May, the state had collected $3.67 million in nonrefundable application fees from 510 pre-filed application forms, according to the state.The DHSS has said it will use a blind scoring process to assess the applications.Companies have also retained lobbyists as the application process intensifies.For example, Steven Tilley, former Missouri House speaker and a well-known lobbyist, has signed on numerous cannabis industry clients. He also lobbies for the Missouri Medical Cannabis Trade Association.He was scheduled to co-host a fundraiser last month for Gov. Mike Parson, who oversees the Department of Health and Senior Services.Because of the competition associated with the burgeoning industry, lawsuits could follow if the state rejects licenses.There has already been one dispute, between two companies seeking a state contract to help manage the state’s medical marijuana program. The state has rejected a protest by BioTrackTHC and has granted Metrc LLC the potentially lucrative contract.

LOUIS — A city alderman wants to tighten the city’s curfew for children under age 17 so that they’d have to be home by 10 p.m. Friday and Saturday nights and by 9:30 p.m. other nights.Under the current law on the books for decades, kids have to be inside by midnight Fridays and Saturdays and 11 p.m. the rest of the week.“That’s unacceptable,” Alderman Brandon Bosley, D-3rd Ward, said in an interview after introducing his bill on Friday.

“There’s no reason if you’re not an adult to be outside after hours when we’ve got all of these things going on in the city,” referring to violent crime.Bosley acknowledged that the current law isn’t enforced much. But he said he works closely with police in his north St. Louis ward and that the curfew tightening would be an additional tool in dealing with crime.If the bill passes, he said he’d work to make sure residents in his ward get a notice regarding the changes.
The bill also would end the curfew each day at 7 a.m., an hour and a half later than the current standard.As in the current law, exemptions would be made for kids returning home from school, work, a city-sponsored activity or a religious activity.
Exceptions also are provided for youths accompanied by a parent or someone over 21 years old authorized by a parent.Also Friday, Bosley said he’d soon send a letter to Gov. Mike Parson urging him to send in the Missouri National Guard or Missouri Highway Patrol to St. Louis to help undermanned police deal with violent crime.“Things have to change or they will get worse,” Bosley said.Bosley in April first made the call for the National Guard after a man was shot after a confrontation in an alley that started when the shooter wouldn’t move his car. The victim died at a hospital.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri's Republican attorney general amassing funds as he eyes 2020,"Jun 20, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-s-republican-attorney-general-amassing-funds-as-he-eyes/article_d8bbdb58-41c8-58ab-88f3-24f609812836.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — Just as Missouri Gov. Mike Parson is amassing a campaign war chest in anticipation of a run for a full term, the man he appointed attorney general also is ramping up fundraising heading toward 2020.Supporters of Republican Eric Schmitt of Glendale have raked in more than a half million dollars on his behalf, collecting cash from big money donors like retired St. Louis financier Rex Sinquefield, who wrote a check for $250,000 in February.At the helm of the fundraising efforts for the pro-Schmitt political action committee known as MO Opportunity PAC is Meredith Gibbons, who formerly raised millions of dollars for disgraced former Gov. Eric Greitens. Records show she is receiving $8,000 a month to fill the coffers.

The PAC snared a $100,000 check from Herzog Contracting, a St. Joseph-based construction services company run by Stanley Herzog. Herzog is a large donor to Republican causes. In 2016, for example, the company gave $650,000 to Greitens.Other big donors include August Busch III who gave $50,000 in May.As of April 1, the PAC had $147,000. However, that doesn’t count an additional $350,000 the PAC has in a certificate of deposit that comes due in September 2019.And, that doesn’t account for the money Schmitt has raised for his own personal campaign account. The latest reports show he has $415,000 in that account.For now, the only Democrat who has announced plans to run has just $13,930 in his campaign account.St. Louis attorney Elad Gross is a political newcomer who is hoping to return the seat to Democratic hands. Before 2017, the post had been held by Democrats dating to 1993.
Schmitt was appointed attorney general after fellow Republican Josh Hawley vacated the office to join the U.S. Senate. He earned his law degree from the St. Louis University School of Law in 2000. He served two terms in the state Senate representing parts of west St. Louis County, and was a partner at the Lathrop Gage law firm until being sworn in as treasurer in 2017.The two men serving as treasurer and deputy treasurer are Carl Struby and Jean Paul Bradshaw, both of whom are Lathrop Gage attorneys.Attempts to discuss the fund with them were unsuccessful.
The campaign fund is similar to one formed on behalf of Parson. Unlike their personal campaign accounts, which cannot receive contributions over $2,600, the separate campaign committees can take in unlimited contributions.Since Missouri voters enacted limits on campaign contributions in 2016, a growing number of candidates have set up political action committees that do not have to abide by those rules.But unlike Greitens’ use of a nonprofit to raise money, the names of donors and the amounts they contribute are publicly disclosed.During his 17 months in office, Greitens used the nonprofit group A New Missouri to promote his agenda.The use of the nonprofit, which also employed Gibbons, led to accusations that Greitens violated Missouri campaign finance law by intentionally concealing donors, and worries that his backers gained unfair influence within state government.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Ex-judge who supported anti-abortion pregnancy center will help decide fate of Missouri's only abortion clinic,"Jun 18, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/ex-judge-who-supported-anti-abortion-pregnancy-center-will-help/article_8cf62786-718f-5b54-8928-11a794b4e2cf.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — Gov. Mike Parson appointed a former judge who has supported an anti-abortion pregnancy center — and been disciplined for publicly doing so — to an administrative panel that could handle a licensing dispute with the state’s only abortion clinic.The Missouri Supreme Court in 2015 reprimanded former Macon County Associate Circuit Judge Philip Prewitt for encouraging people to donate to local charities on Facebook, including Ray of Hope Pregnancy Care Ministeries, an anti-abortion nonprofit.The Republican governor, an abortion opponent who last month signed into law one of the strictest abortion laws in the country, on June 3 appointed Prewitt to the Administrative Hearing Commission, a panel that handles disputes between state agencies and businesses or individuals.

Lawyers for the state have argued that the commission should adjudicate a dispute between the state’s only clinic performing abortions and the state health department, which is refusing to renew the clinic’s abortion license. The dispute is now in St. Louis circuit court.Prewitt has weighed in on abortion previously. He ran as a Republican for a state representative seat in 2000 and received a $250 campaign donation from Missouri Right to Life PAC. When he was serving as an associate judge in 2014, he supported Ray of Hope on his Facebook page.“I am happy to be supporting Ray of Hope Pregnancy Center again at their fundraising dinner,” the post read. “Even if you didn’t attend, consider donating to this wonderful organization.”Prewitt also posted about donating to a local cancer fundraiser and local schools.A state judicial oversight organization — the Missouri Commission on Retirement, Removal and Discipline — in 2015 found that Prewitt’s Facebook posts violated a state Supreme Court rule that bans judges from abusing the “prestige of office to advance the personal or economic interests ... of others,” including a rule that a judge may not “personally participate in the solicitation of funds or other fundraising activities.”The commission in court filings noted that Prewitt had no prior complaints against him, was “cooperative and truthful” during the investigation, and that in response he stopped the questionable Facebook posts.
Prewitt told the Associated Press on Monday that he doesn’t see a problem with the reprimand or his past support for the pregnancy care center and from Missouri Right to Life. He said he would consider recusing himself if requested by a party in the case.“I don’t see where it would be a conflict,” Prewitt said. “It doesn’t violate the judicial rules, so I don’t see how it would violate any commissioner rules either.”Parson spokesman Steele Shippy said the governor named Prewitt to the commission based on his experience as a judge and his past military service and that his stance on abortion was not a factor. He said the governor’s office was aware of Prewitt’s previous reprimand, but noted that the Supreme Court did not go further to suspend or revoke his license.
“Based on those qualifications, we believe that he would execute the responsibilities of commissioner appropriately,” Shippy said.Commissioners work individually, and Prewitt said cases are assigned on a rotating basis by a scheduling clerk. Three other commissioners currently serve on the panel and could also be assigned the abortion clinic case, if it ever makes it to the commission.Prewitt lost re-election in 2018 and in December resigned early. He said he applied for an open seat on the Administrative Hearing Commission several months ago and heard back around March.“Many months ago was I considered for the appointment, so this wasn’t even an issue when I was talking to the governor’s office about the appointment,” he said.Since he left his judgeship, Prewitt has continued to be active on Facebook. In February, he posted a photo of a truck with writing on the back that says: “What’s the difference between a gun and a whiny liberal? A gun has only one trigger. #buildwall.” He’s also shared memes about vegans, atheists and a post with a photo of a woman that says, “Why is she wearing leggings?”

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Planned Parenthood earns win in fight over funding in Missouri,"Jun 17, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/planned-parenthood-earns-win-in-fight-over-funding-in-missouri/article_ff1500dc-e4cc-51be-81d2-860b0965b5fd.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — A St. Louis judge has blocked Missouri’s Republican-led Legislature from cutting off funding to abortion providers and their affiliates.In a decision that adds another legal front to the courtroom battles already underway between a state government controlled by the GOP and affiliates of Planned Parenthood, Judge David Dowd said the attempted funding prohibition was constitutionally flawed and couldn’t be completely enforced.The ruling potentially protects health care options for an estimated 7,000 people.

The case stems from a 2018 initiative by lawmakers to block Medicaid funding from going to “any abortion facility” and “any affiliate or associate thereof.”It has become a common practice for lawmakers to use the budget to legislate policy initiatives. This year, for example, they used the maneuver to block college students with unlawful immigration status from receiving in-state tuition rates at Missouri universities.In the case of the abortion language, Planned Parenthood sued the state saying some of its chapters provide preventive health care, but not abortion, and should not be penalized.In his decision, Dowd wrote that “eligible individuals are allowed to choose the provider they wish to see and the state is required to pay for those services on behalf of the eligible individual.”It remains unclear whether a tweak in this year’s budget might allow the prohibition to stay intact in the new fiscal year beginning at the end of this month.In a statement, Gov. Mike Parson suggested the ruling would be appealed.
”Our office is still reviewing the court’s decision, however, we will always defend our position that no state taxpayer dollars should be used to fund abortion,” the statement noted.The ruling comes as the state and abortion rights advocates continue to fight on multiple issues.



            Planned Parenthood order
On Thursday, the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services filed a motion asking St. Louis Circuit Judge Michael Stelzer to withdraw his preliminary injunction extending the license for Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region.The state’s court filing also outlined results of a two-month investigation into the clinic and attached a letter highlighting “at least 30 deficient practices” the state says must be addressed before the clinic’s license can be renewed.Planned Parenthood officials accused Parson’s administration of politicizing state health regulations to restrict access to legal abortions in Missouri.A separate court fight is underway over attempts to put a question on the 2020 ballot asking if Missouri voters support a restrictive new law that prohibits abortion after the eighth week of pregnancy.That issue is pending at the appeals court level.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Editorial: New child-wellness numbers suggest 'pro-life' lawmakers are missing the mark,"Jun 17, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-new-child-wellness-numbers-suggest-pro-life-lawmakers-are/article_d009a3ef-dc2e-5a73-92a0-12d4c9d95151.html,"For state legislatures around the country, the latest “Kids Count” report by the Annie E. Casey Foundation offers some important guideposts on funding priorities to ensure fewer children aren’t forced to grow up in poverty with substandard health care and education. The report has lots of good news but also points to some persistent trouble spots.For Republican-dominated states like Missouri, the report’s findings serve as a stark warning: Despite claims of being “pro-life,” lawmakers fall seriously short when it comes to ensuring a quality existence for all children beyond the womb. Forced-birth laws such as the one passed by Missouri’s Legislature last month and signed by Gov. Mike Parson have been celebrated by abortion-rights opponents as a major victory. But lawmakers continue to shortchange children in terms of their education, health care and financial security.First some good news from the report: Nationwide, the percentage of children growing up in poverty dropped 4 percentage points between 2010 and 2017. Fewer parents lack secure employment, and fewer teens are listed as neither in school nor working. But today, more than 13 million children — about 18% of all children — still live in poverty, while more than a quarter of all parents lack secure employment.

In Missouri, 19% of kids are growing up in poverty, and 27% of parents lack secure employment. More Missouri children are growing up in single-parent households, but a smaller percentage are in families where the head of household lacks a high school diploma. Teen births also show a promising, sharp downward trend. But there’s been a sharp increase in child and teen deaths per 100,000 population.
The educational picture continues on a stubborn trajectory. Nationally and in Missouri, more than half of children ages 3 and 4 are not in school despite research pointing to improved educational outcomes when young children receive prekindergarten instruction. Missouri showed only slight improvement in the number of fourth graders not proficient in reading, dropping from 64% in 2009 to 63% in 2017.The percentage of Missouri eighth graders not proficient in math has worsened over the past 10 years. Two-thirds now rank as nonproficient. Nevertheless, nationally as well as in Missouri, the percentage of high school students graduating on time is on a dramatic upswing.
Missouri consistently ranks in the middle or among the bottom half of states in performance on overall child well-being, economic security, education and health. It shares those low rankings with Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, Arkansas and Louisiana — states where the most restrictive abortion laws in the country have recently been passed.These male-dominated legislatures claim to be fighting for children when they enact laws forcing women to give birth regardless of their emotional or financial preparedness for parenthood. But the latest Kids Count numbers expose the hypocrisy behind those “pro-life” claims."
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Voters said no to gas tax hike, so Missouri will start limited bridge replacement program","Jun 17, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/voters-said-no-to-gas-tax-hike-so-missouri-will/article_57aa47e2-9106-5112-a6be-f768a347eaf9.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — Missouri transportation officials are on track to begin replacing 40 bridges as part of a $350 million road improvement program approved by lawmakers and signed this week into law by Gov. Mike Parson.Most of the projects are small bridges in rural areas of the state.There are no bridges in St. Charles County on the list and only one is in St. Louis County. The work includes the replacement of the Ladue Road bridge that spans Hibler Creek in Creve Coeur. Work is scheduled to begin on that one later this fall.

Other nearby projects include the Missouri Highway 30 bridge over Saline Creek in Jefferson County and the Highway 79 bridge over McLean’s Branch near Winfield.Money to pay for the work is coming out of a $50 million fund set aside by lawmakers this spring as they attempted to craft a transportation improvement program without the aid of additional dollars from the state’s gasoline tax.The motor fuel tax typically pays for roadwork. But, in 2018, voters rejected a phased-in increase of 10 cents in the state’s 17-cents-per-gallon tax on gas.Parson, a Republican, had backed the tax hike as a way to address a growing backlog of road repairs facing the Missouri Department of Transportation.Without that additional revenue, he convinced lawmakers to allow MoDOT to sell $301 million in bonds to pay for repairs to 220 bridges across the state. But, as part of a deal with lawmakers reluctant to take out a loan for the work, the bonds will only be used if the state is awarded federal matching funds to replace the 59-year-old Interstate 70 bridge over the Missouri River near Rocheport.MoDOT Director Patrick McKenna said he believes Missouri has a good chance of receiving the grant because of the amount of commercial truck traffic plying I-70.
“It puts us in a hopeful position,” McKenna told the Post-Dispatch.The state could find out by September whether the federal dollars are coming for the estimated $350 million project.Missouri’s application calls for the state to pay $105.2 million, and Columbia and Boone County each would provide $2 million. The state also would receive a $73.1 million federal loan.
“It was a very aggressive application,” McKenna said.In January, the lack of bridges targeted for work in St. Charles County triggered outcry from the county’s two state senators, Republicans Bob Onder of Lake Saint Louis and Bill Eigel of Weldon Spring.Eigel said he took his concerns to Parson in hopes of addressing the absence of work in one of the state’s most populous counties.In making his pitch for the brige plan, Parson said the list of projects was not politically driven, because they were chosen by regional planning boards and then approved by the state Highways and Transportation Commission.After the first round of 40 bridges get underway, others the St. Louis region expected to be replaced include the $2.7 million replacement of a bridge over Happy Sac Creek in Franklin County and a $4.4 million replacement project at the intersection of Valley Dell Drive and Gravois Road in Jefferson County.Also on tap for work are the North Broadway bridge over Interstate 44 in St. Louis and the replacement of the Missouri Highway 47 bridge over Interstate 44 in St. Clair in Franklin County.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,State asks St. Louis judge to rescind order in abortion clinic's license fight,"Jun 13, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/state-asks-st-louis-judge-to-rescind-order-in-abortion/article_955ba38b-9676-5f0a-938f-54e3a354caa6.html,"ST. LOUIS — State health officials asked a St. Louis judge on Thursday to reconsider his order allowing Missouri’s only abortion clinic to remain open for now.The Department of Health and Senior Services filed a motion Thursday asking Circuit Judge Michael Stelzer to withdraw his preliminary injunction extending the license for Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region. The state’s court filing also outlined results of a two-month investigation into the clinic and attached a letter to the clinic, highlighting “at least 30 deficient practices” the state says must be addressed before the clinic’s license can be renewed.The deficiencies cited include inadequately supervised pelvic exams, failed surgical and medication abortions, untimely reporting of those failed procedures and poor communication with a contracted laboratory. The state said some problems noted in the investigation caused “serious patient harm.”

Planned Parenthood officials accused Gov. Mike Parson’s administration of politicizing state health regulations to restrict access to legal abortions in Missouri.“We’re reviewing the state’s latest political attempt to shut down the last legal abortion provider in Missouri,” Jesse Lawder, a spokesman for Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region, said in a statement Thursday. “From the start, Gov. Parson and DHSS Director Randall Williams have attempted to advance a political agenda, weaponizing the inspection process, and we have no reason to believe this is any different.”DHSS’ court filing Thursday is the latest response in Planned Parenthood’s lawsuit aimed at keeping Missouri from becoming the first U.S. state without an abortion clinic since the Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade decision in 1973 established a woman’s right to terminate her pregnancy.The state’s deficiencies list included a pelvic exam that failed to detect a problem with a woman’s uterus and led to two failed abortion attempts on her. The list also included a lack of an “informed consent” consultation with a woman who later went to the emergency room over complications from an abortion.In addition to its list of deficiencies, the state reiterated in its court brief that a state administrative commission — not a state court — is the proper place for Planned Parenthood’s license complaints. State officials asked Planned Parenthood to produce a correction plan by the end of Tuesday.Planned Parenthood sued the department last month claiming the state agency had illegally refused to renew the St. Louis abortion clinic’s yearly license until the state could complete an investigation. The state has argued that Planned Parenthood failed to comply with licensing regulations by not compelling five doctors who have worked at the clinic to be interviewed as part of the state’s investigation.Stelzer ruled Monday that DHSS must decide whether to renew Planned Parenthood’s license by June 21, the date of the next court hearing over the licensing lawsuit. Stelzer did not instruct the state how to rule, but said it had the exclusive authority to decide.
Planned Parenthood’s legal fight coincides with Parson last month signing one of the nation’s strictest abortion laws, banning the procedures after the eighth week of pregnancy.Other lawsuits
On Thursday, a Cole County judge tossed out one of a trio of lawsuits seeking to allow voters to decide the fate of the state’s new abortion restrictions.In dismissing the legal challenge by the American Civil Liberties Union of Missouri, Circuit Judge Daniel Green gave the organization a chance to pursue the case to a state appeals court, where the case was likely to end up anyway.The decision to dismiss the case came two days after Green set a hearing for Monday to discuss the challenge, as well as one funded by wealthy Republican campaign donor David Humphreys, who opposes the new law because it lacks protections for women who are raped or victims of incest.Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft, who signs off on proposed referendums, contends the ballot initiatives cannot go forward because part of the abortion law is already in effect.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"In rare move, Missouri governor to hand off power to No. 2 while on overseas vacation","Jun 13, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/in-rare-move-missouri-governor-to-hand-off-power-to/article_2cbc64fe-7dc5-597e-bced-b059c7f5b4e8.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — Missouri Gov. Mike Parson is taking steps to temporarily hand over power to the state’s No. 2 officeholder later this month when he travels to Europe for a trade mission and a vacation.Under a plan that is still taking shape, the Post-Dispatch has learned Parson is planning to cede his gubernatorial powers to fellow Republican Lt. Gov. Mike Kehoe during the vacation portion of his overseas trip from June 23 to July 2.The maneuver will allow Kehoe to sign legislation on Parson’s behalf, including a proposal that will transfer oversight of the Missouri Arts Council from the Department of Economic Development to the lieutenant governor’s office.

He also will have the ability to create a task force on food and beverage manufacturing in Missouri and appoint members to a Route 66 centennial commission.As acting governor, Kehoe won’t have the ability to pardon prisoners, commute sentences or many of the other powers given to the chief executive, administration officials said.Parson intends to resume his duties when he and first lady Teresa Parson return, officials said. Details of their vacation were not immediately available.The governor, who was appointed to the post June 1, 2018, after the resignation of scandal-plagued former Gov. Eric Greitens, is relying on a clause in the state constitution that allows the chief executive to grant his powers to the lieutenant governor.Under that provision, he must submit a letter to legislative leaders declaring he is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.Such moves are not common. But, Parson and Kehoe are from the same party and Parson appointed Kehoe to the No. 2 post after Parson took over as governor.The last time the event occurred was in 2005 when then-Gov. Matt Blunt ceded power to former Lt. Gov. Peter Kinder for a short period of time.In 2016, Kinder, a Republican, sent former Gov. Jay Nixon, a Democrat, a letter demanding Nixon grant him gubernatorial powers as Nixon was preparing to leave on an overseas trade mission.Kinder said the state needed a chief executive in the wake of violence against law enforcement officers, including a Ballwin police officer.
“I believe MO needs a leader with the authority to defend her,” Kinder said in a tweet at the time.Nixon cancelled the trip and did not address Kinder’s request.The rules governing who’s in charge when a governor is traveling vary from state to state.For example, a provision of North Carolina’s constitution automatically elevates the lieutenant to acting governor when the full-time chief executive is absent from the state.
A similar scenario has been in California law since 1849. It says a governor must be within the state borders to have the powers of the office.Parson departs for France Saturday as part of a trade mission to Europe that includes stops in Germany and Switzerland.In what will be his first overseas trip since taking off last year, the Republican will retrace the steps taken by his predecessors during a visit to the Paris Air Show.Nixon and Blunt also attended the air show to highlight Missouri’s aerospace industry, which includes Boeing Co. and its St. Louis-made F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jets.Greitens was scheduled to go in 2017, but canceled after he called lawmakers back to the Capitol for a special session.The air show is set to get underway on Monday.Costs of the official portion of the trip will be shared between state taxpayers and the Hawthorn Foundation, a public/private partnership created by then-Gov. Kit Bond to help fund gubernatorial travel expenses.Parson’s vacation will not be funded by taxpayers.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Abortion vote lawsuit dismissed, but efforts continue to let voters decide fate of law","Jun 13, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/abortion-vote-lawsuit-dismissed-but-efforts-continue-to-let-voters/article_5b3efaf5-acab-5d1c-b398-207a5f23cd91.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — A Cole County judge on Thursday tossed out one of a trio of lawsuits seeking to allow voters to decide the fate of the state’s new restrictions on abortion.In dismissing the legal challenged by the American Civil Liberties Union of Missouri, Circuit Judge Daniel Green gave the organization a chance to pursue the case to a state appeals court, where the case was likely to end up anyway.The decision to dismiss the case came two days after Green set a hearing Monday to discuss the challenge, as well as one funded by wealthy Republican campaign donor David Humphreys, who opposes the new law because it lacks protections for women who are raped or victims of incest.

Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft, who signs off on proposed referendums, contends the ballot initiatives cannot go forward because one part of the abortion law is already in effect.The new law bans doctors from terminating a woman’s pregnancy after the eighth week, except in medical emergencies.The law would ban abortion completely in Missouri if the Supreme Court overturns the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that made abortion legal throughout the United States.Those elements don’t go into effect until Aug. 28.But a provision requiring both parents to be notified of a planned abortion of a minor went into effect when Republican Gov. Mike Parson signed the legislation last month.ACLU attorney Tony Rothert told the Post-Dispatch Thursday that the group wanted Green to dismiss the case in order to keep the lawsuit moving in the court system.
Opponents of the law are working against an Aug. 28 deadline to collect 100,000 signatures to freeze the law until a vote can be held. But, the legality of the initiative must be determined first.Rothert wants the appeals court to put the case on a fast track.""We'll be asking for it to be expedited. We hope the appeal can be resolved in a couple of weeks,"" Rothert said.
Among the arguments the appellate court may hear is whether requiring two parent notification for minors is an actual emergency.""That could be part of the argument,"" Rothert said.Attorney Lowell Pearson, who is representing Humphreys, said the emergency clause prohibition on referendums doesn’t apply because only part of the bill, and not the entire measure, went into effect right away.Pearson and the ACLU also say that provision is not an actual emergency, citing statements by the bill’s sponsor that the insertion of an emergency clause was designed to block a referendum.The ACLU said the Legislature ""cannot tack an emergency law onto a non-emergency law in order to evade citizens' fundamental right of review on laws that fall unambiguously within the people's constitutional referendum power.""

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Editorial: Trump administration parts ways with ""pro-lifers"" on when life begins","Jun 12, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-trump-administration-parts-ways-with-pro-lifers-on-when/article_de14e21c-2b69-54ae-9a8e-d41bed1e891d.html,"Religious conservative lawmakers seem hellbent on prompting legal challenges to the abortion issue until the U.S. Supreme Court is forced to rethink its 1973 Roe v. Wade decision. They’d better be careful what they wish for.A new spate of abortion laws, including in Missouri, attempt to define embryonic life for the purpose of outlawing abortion, but they also force the question: At what point does life begin? The question has been asked philosophically countless times. But from a lawmaking standpoint, it remains as ill-defined today as ever. If Supreme Court justices pose this question, lawyers for the “pro-life” faction could have a nightmarish experience defending their answer.Lawmakers in Missouri and other states have attempted to legally define viability as the moment a fetal heartbeat can be detected, which typically occurs six to eight weeks from conception. Under a new law signed by Gov. Mike Parson, no abortions may legally occur after that, including for rape and incest victims, unless the mother’s life is in danger.

The detectable heartbeat defines the embryo as a living human being under these laws. Doctors who perform abortions after eight weeks of pregnancy can be held criminally responsible. Alabama would put them on trial for homicide.Supporters of such draconian laws credit President Donald Trump as their biggest champion for having tipped the Supreme Court’s conservative balance enough to overturn Roe. But in 1973, the court deliberately established a much more amorphous definition of when life begins.
“We need not resolve the difficult question of when life begins,” the Roe decision states. “When those trained in the respective disciplines of medicine, philosophy, and theology are unable to arrive at any consensus, the judiciary, at this point in the development of man’s knowledge, is not in a position to speculate as to the answer.”
The Trump administration might not turn out to be such a champion after all if the court looks at its record as a potential weather vane.On Feb. 22, a Honduran woman was under detention by Immigration and Customs Enforcement when she went into premature labor at 27 weeks of pregnancy. The baby was born dead, even though the mother had received two medical screenings during detention and was declared healthy.ICE nevertheless stated that this didn’t qualify as an “in-custody death,” which put the Trump administration on record as saying that, even at six months, a fetus in the womb doesn’t count as a life. Of course, ICE made that determination not out of consideration for future Supreme Court challenges but because it wanted to avoid adding to its already embarrassing death-under-detention statistics.In other words, when forced to choose, the Trump administration opted for political expediency. After 46 years of punting the question, the definition of life in the womb remains as much a political football as ever."

Suzie, however, may have to watch her parents fight as they spend too much money on legal bills and become angrier with each other. Eventually, one of Suzie’s parents, most likely her dad, will basically become an every-other-weekend visitor in her life. That’s a sad present for a dad on Father’s Day — and for Suzie.What will cause the huge difference in the girls’ lives? Each girl loves both her parents and all the parents are good caregivers. The difference is caused, believe it or not, by the few miles between them. Ava lives in Kentucky, where a law was passed last year ensuring that children of divorce get to see both parents equally. Suzie lives in Missouri, where the lack of such a law drives parents to fight tooth and nail to “win” custody if they are to continue in their full parenting role.Kentucky’s law, the first real shared-parenting law in the nation, passed just one year ago and has a presumption that both parents have equal decision making and parenting time. This arrangement is true shared parenting. Decades of scientific research show this is generally the best arrangement for children in divorced families. Kentucky’s law excludes parents who are likely to abuse or neglect a child, of course. But for the vast majority of families, both parents can be assured of a full continuing parent-child relationship.

In contrast, Missouri’s law is based on the court choosing a primary custodian for the children. In other words, one of Suzie’s parents retains the role as a real parent. The other one is pushed to the edges of her life and only gets to see her during what is often limited “visitation.” Suzie wants to stay close to both of her quality parents but the state of Missouri makes this difficult unless the parents both agree to it from the outset. When they don’t, Missouri drives them to put on their boxing gloves and fight with everything they have. It’s no wonder so many good people, and their children, go through tough divorces.Last month, there was hope for Suzie and all of Missouri’s children when state lawmakers considered a presumption of equal parenting time. House Bill 229 made it through the House. It was referred to a Senate committee but failed to be brought to the Senate floor for a vote because lawmakers ran out of time. This dealt a devastating blow to children in Missouri, who need and deserve both parents just like their friends in Kentucky.
And why wouldn’t Gov. Mike Parson and other lawmakers support shared parenting? Kentucky’s House passed the law 81-2, and its Senate passed the law unanimously. Research has shown that equal parenting time is best for children of divorce, second only to an intact family. Polling consistently shows that the public supports shared parenting. Divorce doesn’t eliminate the family, it just rearranges it. Children still need the love and attention of both parents and extended families.
Many states now have legislation in the works because children of divorce should not have to feel abandoned by one parent, and parents should not have to fear losing contact with their children. We encourage anyone interested in doing right by our children to send an email to your state representative or senator and ask them to support equal shared parenting. To learn how, visit www.nationalparentsorganization.org.This Father’s Day — and every day — the question to ask is this: When it comes to parenting children, should it really matter which state you live in? Every state in the nation should follow Kentucky’s lead and give children what they need and want — both parents.Matt Hale is former chair of the Kentucky chapter and current board member of the National Parents Organization.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Strike 3: Missouri's election chief rejects another effort to let voters weigh in on abortion law,"Jun 11, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/strike-missouri-s-election-chief-rejects-another-effort-to-let/article_b5e26714-b2d8-54be-8e63-cdb4f341c6b6.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — Missouri’s top election chief Tuesday rejected a third proposal to allow voters to weigh in on the state’s tough new abortion law.Citing a similar argument to one he made when rejecting two previous referendum requests last week, Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft said the fact that one part of the abortion law is already in effect bars the law from being put before voters in 2020.The decision came just minutes after an appeal hearing on the two other requests ended without a rulingon whether Ashcroft’s decision should be overruled.

Circuit Judge Daniel Green of Cole County wants opponents of the law to submit a new request for relief after he found technical problems with their argument. The next hearing on the matter is set for Monday.The action came a day after St. Louis Circuit Judge Michael Stelzer granted Planned Parenthood of St. Louis a preliminary injunction in a separate case allowing Missouri’s only abortion clinic to remain open for now.That order was the latest decision in Planned Parenthood’s legal fight to keep Missouri from becoming the first U.S. state without an abortion clinic since the Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade decision in 1973 established a woman’s right to terminate her pregnancy.Stelzer’s order mandates the Department of Health and Senior Services issue a decision on the renewal of Planned Parenthood’s license “without undue delay but no later than June 21.”The judge did not tell the state how to rule. “The authority to make that decision rests exclusively with the Department of Health and Senior Services,” the order said.The new law bans abortions at the eighth week of a pregnancy, except in medical emergencies. There is no exception for pregnancies caused by rape or incest.The law would ban abortion completely in Missouri if the Supreme Court overturns the Roe v. Wade ruling.The American Civil Liberties Union of Missouri and Joplin roofing magnate David Humphreys, who is a major donor to Republican causes, want voters to have the opportunity to reject the law.Under the state constitution, most new laws in Missouri take effect Aug. 28 of each year.However, before sending the measure to Gov. Mike Parson, Republicans inserted a clause to have part of the law take effect immediately. That clause concerns parental notification of a minor’s abortion.In rejecting the petitions, Ashcroft cited a provision in the constitution that prohibits referendums on “laws necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health or safety.”The ACLU and Humphreys contend Missouri case law states that judges can determine whether an emergency clause is valid.Attorney Lowell Pearson, who is representing Humphreys, said the emergency clause prohibition on referendums doesn’t apply because only part of the bill, and not the entire measure, went into effect right away.The ACLU said the emergency clause was included “not because of an immediate need to preserve the public peace, health, or safety but rather in order to defeat any attempt to refer the bill for voter approval or rejection under the fundamental right of referendum described in Missouri.”The third petition, which was submitted by Humphreys, asks voters to strike everything in the law except the two-parent notification provision.
Ashcroft said that maneuver wouldn’t work.“A small number of state constitutions provide an option to refer a portion of a law to the people for a vote, but Missouri does not have that option,” Ashcroft said in a statement Tuesday.Groups seeking to overturn the law have until Aug. 28 to gather an estimated 100,000 signatures to stop the law from going into effect until a referendum is held.Although the clock is ticking, Pearson told reporters he’s not worried about running out of time.“It is unlikely to cause any delay,” Pearson said.License dispute
The fight over the new law comes against the backdrop of a separate licensing dispute between the state and Planned Parenthood’s Central West Ed clinic.Planned Parenthood sued the department last month, alleging the state agency had illegally refused to renew the St. Louis abortion clinic’s yearly license until the state could complete an investigation into an unspecified patient complaint.The department alleged it found instances of “multiple” failed abortions at the clinic and that Planned Parenthood was not complying with further investigation. The license was to expire Friday.Planned Parenthood argued in court that Missouri had no right to withhold the license because it had corrected the problems cited by the state. One of the deficiencies the state cited was the timing of a pelvic exam and the clinic’s failure to ensure the doctor providing an “informed consent visit” 72 hours before an abortion was the same one performing the procedure. The clinic says it corrected all deficiencies the state cited in its inspection.The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, which sets guidelines for women’s health care, criticized the Missouri Legislature and health department for creating “unnecessary obstacles for women trying to access constitutionally protected, medically appropriate care.”“It is unacceptable that lawmakers and bureaucrats are attempting to dictate how doctors practice medicine without regard to medical science and are treating them like criminals,” the organization said in a statement. “While pelvic exams may be appropriate for patients with certain conditions, routine multiple pelvic exams for women seeking abortion care are unwarranted, invasive, and not supported by evidence.”State health department chief Dr. Randall Williams, who is licensed by Missouri as an obstetrician-gynecologist and is a member of the national medical organization, has previously called pre-abortion pelvic exams “good, standard medical practice.”The health department in a news release Monday said the pelvic exam has been part of mandatory health assessment since 1988, and that the regulation requiring the exam has changed only once, in 2018. The statement came in response to what it said was inaccurate information reported by “a national media outlet.”In response, Dr. Colleen McNicholas, an obstetrician-gynecologist at Planned Parenthood in St. Louis, and the clinic’s medical director, Dr. David Eisenberg, held a press conference Tuesday at the clinic.The state recently started enforcing “medically unnecessary and invasive” pelvic exams on women seeking medication abortions, who make up more than one-third of the clinic’s patients, Eisenberg said.“I can’t explain why they would justify such a change in their interpretation other than their intent to stop abortion care being available in the state of Missouri,” Eisenberg said.Blythe Bernhard of the Post-Dispatch contributed to this report.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri attorney general quiet so far on auditor's Sunshine Law questions,"Jun 11, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-attorney-general-quiet-so-far-on-auditor-s-sunshine/article_5d532be3-f3d3-514b-af13-538e8a4d9336.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — Attorney General Eric Schmitt has not said whether state agencies may cite the First Amendment to redact public records — and he may not ever answer that question, according to documents reviewed by the Post-Dispatch.Gov. Mike Parson’s attorneys have cited the First Amendment numerous times as a reason to hide the contact information of private residents from public scrutiny.Parson’s spokesman has said disclosure of such information may have a chilling effect on individuals contacting their government, and has said the office has redacted such information in the past without citing the First Amendment.

Auditor Nicole Galloway, a Democrat who is considering running against Parson next year, asked Schmitt on May 7 to issue an opinion on the validity of Parson’s First Amendment citations.“Government should not be in the business of finding ways to hide information from taxpayers, but time and again, we have seen continued efforts to do just that,” Galloway said at the time.On May 9, Jonathan M. Hensley, deputy general counsel for the attorney general’s office, said in a letter to Galloway that the office had received the “request for an Attorney General’s opinion regarding whether identifying information related to an individual conducting business before a state entity should be redacted under the Sunshine Law.”But that wasn’t the question Galloway wanted an answer to, Paul Harper, general counsel for the auditor’s office, wrote back on May 14.“I am writing this letter to confirm that this description was not intended to limit the question asked,” Harper wrote on May 14. “The State Auditor is seeking an Attorney General Opinion on a question of law related to whether the First Amendment of the US Constitution provides an exception to the Sunshine Law such that a government entity can redact, any or possibly all, identifying information related to an individual who is conducting or seeking to conduct business before the entity.”
Steph Deidrick, spokeswoman for Galloway, said the office has not received correspondence from the attorney general’s office since the May 9 letter.That letter went on to say: “We generally work on the opinion requests in the order that they are received and make every effort to complete them in a timely fashion. We will contact you within 90 days of receipt of the opinion request.”
Chris Nuelle, spokesman for the attorney general’s office, said it is office policy not to comment on pending requests, but said “the request for legal opinion is under review.”“I cannot fathom the theory under which they came up with that argument, because the First Amendment deals with freedom of speech and the ability to speak what you want to say, and it doesn’t at all deal with public officials closing public records,” said Jean Maneke, counsel for the Missouri Press Association.She said people who contact the government “know they’re contacting a public official. They know that this is a person that has to do things publicly.”After Galloway’s office submitted the request, Steele Shippy, the governor’s spokesman, told the Kansas City Star, which first reported the use of the First Amendment citation, that the letter was “yet another lame partisan political attempt.”Schmitt, a Republican, was appointed by Parson, also a Republican, to be attorney general last year after then-Attorney General Josh Hawley won election to the U.S. Senate.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"St. Louis abortion clinic can stay open, for now","Jun 11, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/st-louis-abortion-clinic-can-stay-open-for-now/article_22730b56-727e-5833-ab69-a168cb64990d.html,"ST. LOUIS — Circuit Judge Michael Stelzer granted Planned Parenthood of St. Louis a preliminary injunction Monday, allowing Missouri’s only abortion clinic to remain open for now.Stelzer’s order Monday was the latest decision in Planned Parenthood’s legal fight to keep Missouri from becoming the first U.S. state without an abortion clinic since the Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade decision in 1973 established a woman’s right to terminate her pregnancy.The order mandates that the Department of Health and Senior Services issue a decision on the renewal of Planned Parenthood’s license “without undue delay but no later than June 21.”

Stelzer did not tell the state how to rule. “The authority to make that decision rests exclusively with the Department of Health and Senior Services,” the order said.Planned Parenthood lauded the decision but said its fight against abortion bans is not over.“Today’s ruling gives doctors like me the ability to wake up tomorrow and continue providing safe, legal abortion in the last health center in the state that provides abortion care,” Colleen McNicholas, an obstetrician-gynecologist at the Planned Parenthood facility, said in a written statement. “For patients, that means for now, they can continue to make decisions about their bodies, lives, and future in their home state.”Mary Maschmeier, who leads a local anti-abortion group, said she hopes DHSS does not renew Planned Parenthood’s abortion clinic license.“I’m hoping that the health department will stay firm on the original decision not to renew the license,” she said. “They (Planned Parenthood) need to fix the problems they have, not continue on making more problems.”A representative of the Department of Health and Senior Services did not respond to requests for comment.Planned Parenthood sued the department last month, alleging the state agency had illegally refused to renew the St. Louis abortion clinic’s yearly license until the state could complete an investigation into an unspecified patient complaint.The department alleged it found instances of “multiple” failed abortions at the abortion clinic in the Central West End and that Planned Parenthood was not complying with further investigation.Planned Parenthood argued in court that Missouri had no right to withhold the license for the clinic because it had corrected the problems cited by the state.The Department of Health and Senior Services argued that Planned Parenthood failed to comply with the investigation because it refused to make available for interview seven physicians who had worked at the clinic .The department also argued that a state administrative commission — not a state court — is the proper place for Planned Parenthood’s complaint.
Stelzer’s ruling Monday said he relied on three factors in making his decision: Missouri’s abortion clinic licensing rules may conflict with law; “immediate injury will occur” if its license is allowed to expire; and “the balance between such harm and the injury inflicted” by his decision.The injunction “merely maintains the status quo and is not a ruling on the merits,” Stelzer said.“Finally, the court must weigh the public interest in granting a preliminary injunction,” Stelzer wrote. “Here, the public interest is heightened by the level of scrutiny this case has received and by the strong opinions expressed on both sides of the abortion debate.”Stelzer said DHSS must make a decision, but Planned Parenthood is entitled to a review of that decision by a state licensing commission.
“The court does not believe that an ‘official action’ can include non-action,” Stelzer wrote. “The court finds that petitioner is entitled to a decision from DHSS on its application for renewal of its license.”Stelzer set a status conference for 9 a.m. June 21 in the case.Late last month, Gov. Mike Parson signed one of the nation’s strictest abortion laws, banning them after the eighth week of pregnancy. The ban and the withholding of Planned Parenthood’s license renewal have together turned the nation’s attention on Missouri, one of several states to pass stricter abortion laws.The new law takes effect Aug. 28.The Missouri chapter of the group NARAL Pro-Choice America said Monday that DHSS was using the licensing process to try to effectively ban abortion.“Governor Parson and the anti-choice movement have proven to us that they will continue to fight to restrict access to reproductive healthcare whether it be through legislative attacks or this move to weaponize the licensure process,” said Mallory Schwarz, NARAL Pro-Choice Missouri executive director.“Their goal is to send Missouri to the forefront of a political race to criminalize abortion and shame those who have abortions. Today we celebrate, but the fight for reproductive freedom will continue.”

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Term limits mean St. Charles County senator can't run again, but he's still raising money","Jun 11, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/term-limits-mean-st-charles-county-senator-can-t-run/article_2835d02e-90c3-5579-93ee-576e823e5403.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — Even though he can’t run for the state Senate again because of term limits, a St. Charles County Republican is continuing to raise money for his campaign fund.Sen. Bob Onder, of Lake Saint Louis, is among a trio of GOP lawmakers tag-teaming on a fundraiser in St. Louis on Thursday.Onder, who won re-election last year to his second and final four-year term in the Legislature’s upper chamber, now lists himself as seeking an unspecified statewide office.

He told the Post-Dispatch this week that he hasn’t decided what he might do next.“At this point I don’t have any particular plans for future runs,” Onder said. “I definitely wouldn’t rule one out.”All statewide offices except for auditor will be on the 2020 ballot. Each are currently held by Republicans.Onder, a physician and small business owner, said he may use money donated to his account to help finance the election of other Republican senators, state representatives and county-level candidates.“I will be continuing to fundraise,” said Onder, who had more than $210,000 in his campaign account as of April 1.Last year, Onder was among those seeking to be appointed state treasurer to fill the vacancy left by Eric Schmitt’s move to the attorney general’s post.
Gov. Mike Parson ultimately chose former Rep. Scott Fitzpatrick, R-Shell Knob, for the $108,000-per-year job.In May, Onder didn’t want to discuss his unsuccessful bid for the appointment.“Yeah, I don’t have a comment on that,” he said. “I think the governor had considered a lot of people and I think his selection of Scott Fitzpatrick was an excellent choice and I really strongly support Scott. He’s a good friend of mine and I look forward to helping him win his election to treasurer in 2020.”
Onder, last year, also lost to Sen. Dave Schatz, R-Sullivan, when the two ran for Senate president pro tem. Also in the running were Republican Sens. Mike Cunningham and Ed Emery.Following that, Onder helped form a six-member bloc of GOP senators into what became known as the Conservative Caucus.During the recent legislative session, Onder often sparred with Parson, a fellow Republican. During the final week of the legislative session Onder and other members of the caucus tried to derail a new $10 million scholarship program championed by the governor as well as other incentives the bloc called “corporate welfare.”Onder and others involved in the filibuster ultimately relented and allowed a vote on the measure so the Senate would have enough time to approve a restrictive new abortion law before the Legislature’s May 17 adjournment.Two other members of the caucus — Bill Eigel of Weldon Spring and Andrew Koenig of Manchester — will join Onder at the fundraiser at the Kiel Club at the Stifel Theatre in downtown St. Louis.Koenig, the sponsor of the abortion law, faces a potentially high-profile challenge from Democrats in 2020. Eigel also is up for reelection next year.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri Gov. Mike Parson signs $30 billion budget,"Jun 10, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-gov-mike-parson-signs-billion-budget/article_d54a77a3-470a-5eed-b097-f4393cbaee1c.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — Gov. Mike Parson on Monday signed the state’s $30 billion budget for the fiscal year that starts July 1, finalizing the plan that allocates state support for everything from schools to infrastructure to conservation efforts.Much of the Republican governor’s plan, which he outlined in January, survived the legislative budgeting process. Parson, a Republican, did not issue any line-item vetoes, meaning lawmakers won’t have to debate overriding any budget moves later this year.“We are proud of the General Assembly and their efforts with the fiscal year 2020 budget,” Parson said in a statement. “They have created a fiscally-responsible, balanced budget that will move Missouri forward.”

State workers are poised to receive a 3% raise while Department of Corrections employees will receive additional salary increases in an effort to attract and retain prison officials.The formula used to calculate state aid for K-12 education will be fully funded, with public schools receiving $61.4 million more than this fiscal year, bringing total K-12 spending to $3.54 billion. Public colleges and universities will receive small increases to core funding.The plan also includes $10 million in lottery funds that will go to the “Fast Track” scholarship program for students 25 or older.The governor also won the authority to sell bonds for bridge repairs.In January, Parson proposed selling $350 million worth of bonds, but the Legislature pared that amount to $301 million. The authority to issue the bonds is also contingent on the state winning a federal grant for bridge repairs.
Also included in the spending plan is $50 million in general revenue for bridge repairs, as well as an additional $50 million to be used for an infrastructure cost-share program between cities and the state.The state’s public defenders, despite still being chronically underfunded, also scored minor wins: $500,000 in new spending to address the public defenders’ case backlog; and $913,786 for two juvenile units in St. Louis and Kansas City.
About one-third of the state’s budget is funded by state general revenue. One-third is made up of other funds, while the rest comes from the federal government.As of Friday, net general revenue collections had swelled to $8.9 billion for the fiscal year, a 1.59% increase over net collections at the same point last year.Officials had predicted state revenue would grow by 1.7% this fiscal year.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Latest flood, same complaints: Levees and flood plain development make matters worse","Jun 9, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/latest-flood-same-complaints-levees-and-flood-plain-development-make/article_a4bc876a-c2c7-51c2-9f89-4884b6bc3f3d.html,"ST. LOUIS — The near-historic crest of the Mississippi River soon will be in the rearview mirror for the St. Louis area, with water levels starting to fall this week after reaching their second-highest mark on record.But even if conditions stay dry locally and upstream, it will likely take weeks, at least, for major rivers to return to normal. Some flood-ravaged towns, meanwhile, may need to wait even longer to begin an arduous and expensive recovery process.Of course, much of the region has been through this before — during record flooding in 1993, for instance, and many times this decade alone, including 2013, 2016, and 2017.

As another recovery begins, some critics echo now-familiar, but still unheeded, warnings that it is time to reassess flood policy. And after a quarter century of routine major flooding, they ask when lessons will finally be learned, and when something might be done to minimize future impact.“There are a lot of people out there who understand that we’re making it worse,” said David Stokes, executive director of the Great Rivers Habitat Alliance, an organization focused on river management issues. “Twenty-six years later, we’re basically repeating it. And this is after astronomical flooding in recent years.”Stokes says prevailing policies to build expansive levee systems and promote flood plain development need to change. He recounts taking a recent helicopter ride to survey this year’s “mind-boggling” expanses of local flooding — areas that stand in stark contrast to rival swaths of levee-protected flood plain.“I see Chesterfield Valley totally dry, which is a good thing that it’s dry, but where do they move all of that water?” Stokes asks. “We’ve taken it away from the river where nature intended for it to go, and moved it to create this damage.”Complaints about levees aren’t new. Throughout recent years, Stokes and others have criticized them for worsening floods by constricting river systems, and blame them for simply pushing risk to neighboring areas. But those complaints in the Mississippi River basin go back to at least 1852, when an engineer named Charles Ellet voiced similar concerns about levees in a report to Congress.“Maybe one of these years, someone will start listening to him,” said Stokes.With climate change boosting the likelihood of extreme precipitation, he said that message is only becoming more urgent.“We’re getting more water than we used to,” he said. “And now it’s got nowhere to go.”The same worries are shared by others, including Jonathan Remo, a Southern Illinois University Carbondale professor specializing in flood and river issues.“I’m really shocked about how wet it’s been for the last decade or so,” said Remo, adding that climate modeling suggests that the trend “is what we expect” to see more of.“It looks more and more like there’s a strong climate signal on top of the same cast of characters,” said Remo, describing the combination of more extreme precipitation and the human changes made to watersheds, such as constricting rivers with sprawling levee systems.But with floods in 2019 and other recent years pushing engineered river systems to the very limits, Remo is nervous that there will come a point where society can no longer squeak by, dodging bullets.
“It’s a recipe waiting for disaster in the future,” he said. “Something is going to go catastrophically wrong with the system at some point, and then maybe we’ll see some change.”Based on the political landscape, the outlook for flood policy critics is not too rosy. Even after this latest episode of major flooding, Stokes and Remo fear that leaders will not pursue helpful change.In response to this year’s floods, politicians including Sen. Roy Blunt, Sen. Josh Hawley, and Gov. Mike Parson, have all called for flood protection — and especially protection for farmers — to become a greater priority for agencies like the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.At an April meeting with the corps attended by Parson and leaders of other flood-affected states, Gov. Pete Ricketts of Nebraska specifically called for “rebuilding bigger and better than before to keep people safe.”There is concern that the stances of those elected officials signal that they are not taking a more critical look at levees and how they may contribute to flood problems.
“The lesson has got to be that levees are not the way to answer this flood. … I fear that, from very powerful interest groups, they’re getting the very opposite message,” said Stokes, explaining that groups supporting farmers and engineers have already begun “to use this to demand more spending on structural flood control.”“Their plan would just make the next flood even worse,” he adds, describing the dangers of blocking off even more of the river system’s flood plains. “Where in God’s name do they think this water is going to go?”Remo, at least, is not holding his breath for change, explaining that the “political will” is simply not there.“All of the beneficiaries of the current system are still kind of locked into their position,” he said. “I just think (this flood) is the latest installment of an ongoing series, and I expect more in the near future.”

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri investigating St. Louis Planned Parenthood for 'multiple' failed abortions,"Jun 8, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/missouri-investigating-st-louis-planned-parenthood-for-multiple-failed-abortions/article_237832ab-dd41-532f-b839-3d1f627d028f.html,"ST. LOUIS – The state said Friday it is investigating the local Planned Parenthood office for “multiple” failed abortions, revealing for the first time why it is holding up the Central West End clinic’s license.The state alleged in a statement on Friday that women remained pregnant after the St. Louis clinic performed abortions on them.But a Planned Parenthood official called the state’s announcement “fear mongering” and a “diversionary tactic” that shows it “is treating Planned Parenthood differently in the inspection process.”

“The state continues to hold our license hostage, creating worry and uncertainty for our patients,” Dr. Colleen McNicholas, obstetrician-gynecologist at the St. Louis location, said in a statement.The disclosure of the nature of the state’s investigation comes as Planned Parenthood and the state await a St. Louis judge’s ruling in Planned Parenthood’s lawsuit alleging the state had illegally refused to renew the St. Louis abortion clinic’s yearly license until the state could complete an investigation into an unspecified patient complaint.In March, the state Department of Health and Senior Services held its annual inspection of the St. Louis clinic.In the statement released Friday, the state said regulators identified “serious concerns” during that inspection regarding the handling of fetal tissue extracted from abortions.The state called the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, which opened an investigation into a laboratory contracted by Planned Parenthood to handle fetal tissue, the state said. Federal investigators were trying to determine why women remained pregnant post-abortion. That lab cooperated with the federal agency, confirming the concerns regarding the handling of the tissue provided by Planned Parenthood, the state said.A failed surgical abortion is “very rare,” the state said in its statement, and can usually be detected by the physician who performed the abortion.Failed or incomplete abortions occur in fewer than 1% of procedures, according to the American Pregnancy Association. Women at greater risk of incomplete abortion are those in early stages of pregnancy, those who have prior Cesarean sections or those with a misshapen uterus.Incomplete abortion results in termination of pregnancy in most cases and can lead to prolonged bleeding, cramping and infection. An additional procedure called a dilation and curettage may be required to remove remaining tissue.
As a result of the federal investigation into the lab, Columbia, Mo.-based Boyce & Bynum Pathology Laboratories, lost its accreditation, the state said.A representative from the lab could not immediately be reached.Further investigation has been limited, the state said on Friday, by the “refusal of Planned Parenthood” to make available to investigators the doctors who performed the abortions.
Lisa Cox, spokeswoman for the state department, said Planned Parenthood performed “multiple” failed abortions, but would not say how many.The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services told Boyce & Bynum on Thursday that the laboratory’s accreditation was restored. It was not immediately clear why.But the re-accreditation of Boyce & Bynum, the state said in its statement, allowed the state to publicly release details of its Planned Parenthood investigation for the first time.The legal fight stems from the state’s request to interview in its investigation seven physicians, all who had worked at the Planned Parenthood clinic.If the facility’s license is not renewed, Missouri would become the first U.S. state without an abortion clinic since the Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade decision in 1973 that established a woman’s right to terminate her pregnancy.Late last month, Gov. Mike Parson signed one of the nation’s strictest abortion laws, banning them after the eighth week of pregnancy.Blythe Bernhard of the Post-Dispatch staff contributed to this report.

Mike Parson on Friday named Madeline Orling Connolly circuit judge for the 22nd Circuit, which covers the city of St. Louis, the governor's office announced in a news release.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Big money flows into fight over Missouri's new abortion law,"Jun 7, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/big-money-flows-into-fight-over-missouri-s-new-abortion/article_5283fc39-0a5c-5365-a385-e332abe0963c.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — As promised, a wealthy conservative donor to Republican causes has written a $1 million check in an effort to overturn Missouri’s restrictive new abortion law.A filing with state campaign regulators Friday shows the money from David Humphreys going to a newly formed political action committee known as the Committee to Protect the Rights of Victims of Rape & Incest.It is the first known contribution to the PAC.

Humphreys, a Joplin businessman, had previously urged Republican Gov. Mike Parson to veto the abortion changes, saying a lack of exceptions in House Bill 126 allowing for abortion in cases of rape and incest “is bad public policy and bad for Missourians.”At the time, Humphreys said he would back a referendum asking voters to overturn the legislation if the governor put his signature on the measure.The big money contribution is the latest development in the fight over the new law and the future of abortion in Missouri.State regulators, for example, are clashing with Planned Parenthood over licensing for the state’s lone abortion provider in St. Louis’ Central West End neighborhood.On Thursday, Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft said he had rejected two proposed referendums on the law submitted by the Humphreys-back group and the ACLU of Missouri.Ashcroft, a Republican, said he could not allow the petitions to move forward because part of the law took effect immediately after Parson signed it last month.The provision banning most abortions at eight weeks of pregnancy takes effect on Aug. 28, but a lesser-known provision that requires two-parent notification for minors seeking an abortion took effect last month.The Republican-led Legislature tacked on what is known as an “emergency clause” to the two-parent notification requirement — the reason that provision took effect immediately.“Because of that declaration by the Legislature, and because of the responsibility of the Secretary of State’s office to follow Missouri Supreme Court precedent, and the Constitution, we have no other avenue but to reject Referendum 1 and Referendum 2,” Ashcroft said.Humphreys and the ACLU want the referendums to be approved so backers may start collecting signatures to place a question on the November 2020 ballot.
If the courts reverse Ashcroft’s action, and the language is approved, proponents of a referendum will have until Aug. 28 to turn in more than 100,000 signatures to the secretary of state in order to suspend the law until voters weigh in.Ashcroft’s office has made no decision on the validity of a third referendum, also submitted by Humphreys. That proposal seeks to strike everything but the two-parent notification.Lowell Pearson, attorney for Humphreys, filed a lawsuit Friday challenging Ashcroft’s action in court. Pearson said the emergency clause applies to less than 10% of the entire law, meaning the entire law has not been deemed an emergency, only a section.“We are requesting immediate relief from the Cole County Circuit Court to allow our petition to proceed, which will let Missouri voters decide this monumental public policy issue. Our campaign began to ensure women and underage minors who are the victims of rape and incest are protected. This is a significant step forward in the fight to protect those who have already been victimized by rape or incest. We are committed to that goal,” Humphreys said in a statement Friday.Among those named in the suit was Auditor Nicole Galloway, a Democrat who opposes the new law.
She said she was included in the legal effort because her office is merely fulfilling its responsibility to create an analysis of the costs of the ballot measure.Under state law, within 20 days of receiving a proposed petition, the auditor sends the fiscal note to the attorney general as part of the initiative petition process.“Auditor Galloway has consistently expressed a deep concern about efforts to stifle the voice of the people on ballot initiatives. She disagrees with this latest attempt to limit the power of Missourians to have their voices heard. Auditor Galloway is fighting to uphold citizens’ constitutional rights to hold Jefferson City accountable through the referendum process,” noted a statement issued Friday.The law bans abortions at eight weeks, meaning access to abortion in the earliest stages of a pregnancy would not be banned.But after eight weeks, the only exceptions allowing for abortions would be in medical emergencies. There are no exceptions in cases of rape or incest.While the law allows abortions before eight weeks of pregnancy, if the landmark Roe v. Wade case is overturned by the conservative U.S. Supreme Court, that ruling would trigger another provision in Missouri’s law outlawing nearly all abortions; the only exception would be in medical emergencies.Humphreys, whose Tamko Building Products makes roofing shingles, has funneled millions of dollars toward GOP causes in recent years, including to the election of U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley and to the House Republican fundraising arm.During the 2016 election cycle, Humphreys and his family contributed more than $14 million to Republicans.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri secretary of state bats down referendum on new abortion law,"Jun 6, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-secretary-of-state-bats-down-referendum-on-new-abortion/article_ad83ba84-d4b7-52c8-9d9c-41210597b211.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft said Thursday he had rejected two proposed referendums on the state's new abortion law, a setback for abortion rights proponents seeking to place a measure on the 2020 ballot.Within hours, the ACLU of Missouri, which filed one of the petitions, said it had filed a lawsuit in Cole County Circuit Court asking for a temporary restraining order and injunction barring the secretary of state's action.Ashcroft, a Republican, said he could not allow the petitions to move forward because part of the law took effect immediately after Gov. Mike Parson signed it last month.

The provision banning most abortions at eight weeks of pregnancy takes effect on Aug. 28, but a lesser-known provision that requires two-parent notification for minors seeking an abortion took effect last month.The Republican-led Legislature tacked on what is known as an ""emergency clause"" to the two-parent notification requirement — the reason that provision took effect immediately.""Because of that declaration by the Legislature, and because of the responsibility of the Secretary of State's office to follow Missouri Supreme Court precedent, and the Constitution, we have no other avenue but to reject Referendum 1 and Referendum 2,"" Ashcroft said.The ACLU and GOP mega-donor David Humphreys last month submitted two proposed referendums to Ashcroft. Humphreys and the ACLU want the referendums to be approved so backers may start collecting signatures to place a question on the November 2020 ballot.Tony Rothert, attorney for the ACLU, called Ashcroft's move ""cowardly"" and an attempt to deprive residents of their right to reject newly passed laws.""This move is so predictable, we've already assembled our suit to require the Secretary of State to put aside his anti-abortion agenda and do his job by certifying the referendum,"" Rothert said in a statement Thursday morning.If the courts reverse Ashcroft's action, and the language is approved, proponents of a referendum will have until Aug. 28 to turn in more than 100,000 signatures to the secretary of state in order to place the question on the ballot.Ashcroft's office has made no decision on the validity of a third referendum, also submitted by Humphreys. That referendum seeks to strike everything but the two-parent notification.As Ashcroft made his announcement, lawyer Chuck Hatfield, a Democrat, said the courts have ruled that ""true emergency bills ARE exempt from referendum but courts have held that just [because] Legislature says it doesn't make it so.""Ashcroft, at the news conference, said Hatfield was probably referring to Westhues v. Sullivan and Pollock v. Becker, two century-old court cases.Ashcroft said the two cases make ""it clear that the Secretary of State's Office does not have the ability to decide whether or not an emergency clause is truly an emergency.""Ashcroft said the courts would have to decide whether the two-parent notification piece is truly an emergency.Democrats used the Westhues case as ammunition after Ashcroft's news conference.""Nearly a century ago, the Missouri Supreme Court ruled in Westhues v. Sullivan that the General Assembly cannot thwart a bill from being subject to a referendum petition simply by tacking on an emergency clause,"" House Minority Leader Crystal Quade said in a statement. ""Secretary Ashcroft should voluntarily certify these petitions for circulation before a court orders him to do so.""Lowell Pearson, attorney for Humphreys, said he was planning to challenge Ashcroft's action in court. Pearson said the emergency clause applies to less than 10% of the entire law, meaning the entire law has not been deemed an emergency, only a section. 
The constitution prevents referendums on laws with emergency clauses, not sections, Pearson said.He also predicted Missouri courts would side with petitioners because the state constitution says the power of the government is ""derived from the People.""""The initiative and referendum procedures are a reservation of rights by the People against the government,"" Pearson said in a Wednesday letter to Ashcroft.In a Remington Research survey conducted between May 22 and 23 of Missouri voters, 57% of respondents described themselves as ""pro-life"" while 43% described themselves as ""pro-choice.""The poll surveyed 1,042 likely 2020 general election voters and the margin of error was plus or minus 3%.The Missouri law bans abortions at eight weeks, meaning access to abortion in the earliest stages of a pregnancy would not be banned.
But after eight weeks, the only exceptions allowing for abortions would be in medical emergencies. There are no exceptions in cases of rape or incest.While the law allows abortions before eight weeks of pregnancy, if the landmark Roe v. Wade case is overturned by the conservative U.S. Supreme Court, that ruling would trigger another provision in Missouri's law outlawing nearly all abortions; the only exception would be in medical emergencies.Thirty-two percent of Remington poll respondents said they would support a ban on abortions with no rape or incest exceptions, while 54% of respondents said they would oppose such a ban; 14% said they were unsure.Fifty-one percent of respondents said they would support a ban on abortion if there were rape and incest exceptions, while 34% said they would oppose such a law; 15% of respondents weren't sure.Meanwhile, 40% of respondents said Roe v. Wade should be overturned while 47% said that it should not be overturned; 13% were not sure.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Judge weighs license renewal for Planned Parenthood in St. Louis,"Jun 5, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/judge-weighs-license-renewal-for-planned-parenthood-in-st-louis/article_a5590c6b-d1b9-5912-be44-e2adc38293b2.html,"ST. LOUIS — Planned Parenthood argued in court on Wednesday that Missouri has no right to withhold the license for the Central West End abortion clinic because it has corrected all of the problems cited by the state.Lawyers for the state disagreed, saying Planned Parenthood has not complied with state demands regarding an ongoing investigation into clinic practices.“We are looking at deeply troubling issues of patient care,” said Assistant Attorney General D. John Sauer.

The hearing before Circuit Judge Michael Stelzer centered on technical language in state laws and regulations for renewing health care facilities. The dispute is over Planned Parenthood’s refusal to make available five private doctors to be interviewed as part of the state investigation of the facility.Planned Parenthood’s lawyer Jamie Boyer argued state rules mandate the renewal of its license because the clinic has corrected deficiencies uncovered in a routine inspection. Sauer, the lawyer for the state, disagreed, saying Planned Parenthood has failed to comply by not compelling the five doctors to be interviewed. He also said a state administrative commission — not a state court — is the proper place for Planned Parenthood’s complaint.Stelzer did not rule on Wednesday whether to issue a preliminary injunction that would allow the clinic to continue performing abortions, and did not indicate when he would rule.Wednesday’s hearing was the latest step in Planned Parenthood’s legal fight to keep Missouri from becoming the first U.S. state without an abortion clinic since the Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade decision in 1973 that established a woman’s right to terminate her pregnancy.Stelzer last week issued a temporary restraining order preventing Planned Parenthood’s license from expiring at midnight Friday. The ruling was part of the clinic’s lawsuit against the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services, alleging the state agency had illegally refused to renew the St. Louis abortion clinic’s yearly license.Late last month, Gov. Mike Parson signed one of the nation’s strictest abortion laws, banning them after the eighth week of pregnancy. The two events have together turned the nation’s attention on Missouri, one of several states to pass stricter abortion laws.The new law takes effect on Aug. 28.After Wednesday’s hearing, Dr. Randall Williams, the director of the state’s Department of Health and Senior Services, declined to describe “multiple” deficiencies found by inspectors at the St. Louis clinic, but said they were “critical” matters of life-and-death that will become public record once the state has finished its investigation.“Many Missourians are pro-choice. Many Missourians are pro-life,” he said. “What all those Missourians expect me to do in a regulatory fashion is to enforce the law, enforce the regulations and keep people safe.”
M’Evie Mead, the director of Planned Parenthood Advocates of Missouri, said Parson has put Missouri in the headlines for “all the wrong reasons.”

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Parson disingenuous about women’s health care,"Jun 5, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/mailbag/parson-disingenuous-about-women-s-health-care/article_f6753b60-5996-5483-86ec-6cfde216701d.html,"I recently heard Gov. Mike Parson talk about “standards of care” for women while trying to explain his attack on Planned Parenthood and Missouri women’s rights. What a joke. If you read the court documents, you’ll see state lawmakers require women to undergo two invasive, traumatic, non-medically recommended pelvic exams to bully and punish women seeking their constitutionally-protected right to abortion.

It’s comparable to state-sponsored rape in my opinion, and it makes the claim that Missouri cares about standards of care as laughable as Parson’s claim that he cares about women’s health. How about every man suspected of creating an unwanted pregnancy undergo a mandatory cystoscopy or two? Look it up, then tell me about women’s rights.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri budget numbers on plus side heading toward final weeks of fiscal year,"Jun 5, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-budget-numbers-on-plus-side-heading-toward-final-weeks/article_55a474d8-dce0-5a69-a578-08ec852e16f5.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — After lagging behind estimates for much of the year, state tax collections appear to be on track heading into the final month of the fiscal year.That could mean good news for Republican Gov. Mike Parson, who had been monitoring the potential shortfall earlier this spring in order to determine if he would have to withhold spending to keep the budget balanced.According to Parson’s budget office, the state ended May nearly 2.1 percent ahead of the amount of revenue collected over the same time period a year ago, buoyed largely by an 18 percent increase in tax collections during the prior three months.

All told, the state has collected $9.9 billion this year from individual and corporate income taxes and other fees.In order to avoid making cuts in spending, the state needs to see revenue grow by 1.7 percent through June 30.Parson credited the economy for keeping state revenues in the black.“The governor is encouraged that more Missourians are going back to work, seeing an increase in take-home pay and keeping more of their hard earned money. Employment levels have reached all-time highs and unemployment has remained near historical lows,"" spokesman Steele Shippy said.In addition, for the first time in more than a decade, the governor’s budget did not spend every tax dollar, saving more than $100 million on the bottom line, Shippy said.Budget chief Dan Haug also said low unemployment and trends showing that people are spending money are good signs.""I feel pretty good about where we are. At this point, we're not foreseeing the need for withholds. Revenue has bounced back like we thought and hoped it would,"" Haug said.
The positive revenue forecast comes after months of hand-wringing by state lawmakers, who were watching daily revenue figures roll in far below estimates.Although the state and federal government have cut income tax rates, which could reduce the amount of cash coming into state coffers, part of the problem stemmed from a blunder by the Missouri Department of Revenue.Because of errors in withholding tables drawn up by the department, taxpayers expecting to receive modest refunds instead found they owed the state money. And, for those who did receive a refund, they typically received smaller amounts.The problems were due in part to the December 2017 federal tax overhaul, championed by Republican lawmakers and President Donald Trump.
Congress doubled the standard deduction and eliminated the personal exemption. Missouri bases its income taxes on the federal system and allows a personal exemption only if one is available for federal filers.In the past, taxpayers who minimized the number of dependents generally didn’t owe the state money when they filed.In addition, former Department of Revenue Director Joel Walters said the state did not notice until the federal tax changes a 15-year-old defect in its withholding formula that went unnoticed until the federal tax law exacerbated the impact of the error.A special House committee held numerous hearings into the department’s actions, eventually triggering the resignation of Walters, who had been brought to Missouri by former Gov. Eric Greitens in 2017.Meanwhile, Parson is now reviewing a $30 billion state spending plan for the fiscal year that begins July 1. It is based on revenues growing by 2 percent.The budget blueprint approved by lawmakers last month includes an additional $61 million in core K-12 public school funding, and colleges and universities are set to get at least $1 million more compared to this year.

Circuit Judge Michael Stelzer said “the only issue that is ripe for adjudication” is Planned Parenthood’s request for a preliminary injunction on its claim that the state’s license renewal regulations are at odds with the state constitution.

He also quashed subpoenas filed by the state to compel four doctors to testify in the case. Lawyers for the doctors had shown “that compliance with the subpoenas would present an undue burden and hardship” on the doctors.Stelzer opened Tuesday morning’s hearing by noting “misinformation” about what he had been asked to decide — a licensing issue, not the legality of abortion in Missouri.“The recent changes to the law in Missouri are not in front of this court,” Stelzer said.Stelzer last week issued a temporary restraining order preventing Planned Parenthood’s license from expiring at midnight Friday. The ruling was part of the clinic’s lawsuit against the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services, alleging the state agency had illegally refused to renew the St. Louis abortion clinic’s yearly license until the department could complete an investigation into an unspecified patient complaint.The legal fight stems from the state’s request to interview seven physicians, all of whom had worked at the clinic, as part of the investigation. Five of the doctors, who aren’t employed by Planned Parenthood but come from local university medical programs to treat patients at the clinic, have refused to be interviewed as part of the state’s investigation.If the facility’s license is not renewed, Missouri would become the first U.S. state without an abortion clinic since the Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade decision in 1973 that established a woman’s right to terminate her pregnancy.
Late last month, Gov. Mike Parson signed one of the nation’s strictest abortion laws, banning them after the eighth week of pregnancy. The two events have together turned the nation’s attention on Missouri, one of several states to pass stricter abortion laws.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri handing out no-bid contract to group linked to state prison chief,"Jun 4, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/missouri-handing-out-no-bid-contract-to-group-linked-to/article_d2daabda-7c08-58f2-8107-95ecf5e0b853.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — Gov. Mike Parson’s administration is poised to hand a no-bid contract to a national prison organization with connections to Missouri Department of Corrections Director Anne Precythe.In bidding documents filed May 15, the state announced it would be awarding a six-month contract to the Association of State Correctional Administrators to conduct an evaluation of staffing levels at the state’s 21 prisons.The association “is the only feasible source from which to acquire the custody staffing evaluation services since it is the only national corrections organization to provide the required operations, management and staffing analysis,” the purchasing document notes.

Precythe, who was hired as the top administrator at the sprawling agency by former Gov. Eric Greitens in 2017, serves as treasurer of the association and sits on the organization’s executive committee.Corrections spokeswoman Karen Pojmann told the Post-Dispatch that she doesn’t know how much money the state will be paying the group.“I’m not sure about the cost. We don’t yet have a signed contract in place,” Pojmann said.The evaluation comes as staffing problems at the agency have been well documented in recent years.In January, Parson announced he wanted to give prison guards raises of as much as 13 percent to help slow the high rate of turnover in the agency.Employees in the agency are among the lowest paid in the nation, with correctional officer salaries starting at $28,000 and topping out at $44,476.The pay rate has hampered the department’s recruitment and retention of corrections officers. The job vacancy rate peaked in September 2018, when 848 of the 4,733 guard positions were open. The most recent numbers available show turnover rates of over 18 percent.
The lack of adequate staffing was partly blamed for conditions that sparked a riot by inmates at the Crossroads Corrections Center last year. Inmates were angry about being forced to stay in their cells because of a staffing shortage.On May 12, more than 200 inmates staged a sit-in at the dining hall over reductions in recreation time and other programs. Prison workers were able to convince 131 inmates to end the standoff, but 78 prisoners spent the next six hours rampaging in a central services building.
The Missouri Highway Patrol and local police had to be called in to help quell the disturbance.In January, the Parson administration announced plans to consolidate Crossroads and Western Missouri Correctional Center, both in Cameron, and use the savings to give raises to most of the 11,000 workers at the department.Pojmann said the last time the agency conducted a similar evaluation was a decade ago.“The custody staffing evaluation is our effort to bring in outside industry experts to conduct a shift analysis and review of staffing patterns in correctional centers to maximize efficiency and safety,” Pojmann said in a statement.The association, which is based in Maryland, has conducted similar studies in other states.In a 2014, for example, the association said Nevada should add guards at its prison facilities.“We recommend that 100 staff be hired to avoid having mandated posts go unfilled, or having to fill them with staff working overtime,” the association said in its report.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri's new abortion law is a travesty for women,"Jun 3, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/columnists/missouri-s-new-abortion-law-is-a-travesty-for-women/article_fd6e45c0-6a89-57e8-a871-1e49204e7b69.html,"Missouri finds itself in the national spotlight for all the wrong reasons again — this time, by giving new rights and opportunities to rapists.By signing House Bill 126, which bans abortions even in the case of rape, incest or human trafficking, Gov. Mike Parson has spoken loud and clear. He wants rapists in Missouri to have more power over their victims. He wants a woman’s decisions over her health care to be criminalized. These positions are extreme and cruel.I join the probable majority of Missourians who are appalled by this new law. But I also know this law represents another emotion for Missouri women — fear.

One of the biggest fears a woman has is for her personal safety — the fear of being assaulted or raped. We’ve come to accept the reality that we must protect ourselves from it. We’ve come to accept that we have to be prepared in everyday situations. This is why women carry rape whistles and pepper spray, and have emergency apps on our phones. We carry our keys between our fingers and wear nail polish that can detect date-rape drugs. If we go for a run, we’ve been told to leave one earbud out so we can hear someone coming up behind us.Now, Missouri women have another fear — that in what is potentially their darkest hour, they will be unable to access the care they need. They have fear that if they become a victim of rape, incest or human trafficking, they will not have a choice in what comes next. Instead, a survivor of rape must accept that her attacker could have parental rights. Proponents of this law apparently are comfortable with the idea you could be forced to stand side by side in front of a judge, working out a shared custody plan with your rapist. That is truly frightening.Too many in positions of power disregard women and do not consider — or do not care — how their policy choices amplify those fears. In Missouri, these politicians have consistently attacked the availability of contraception and prenatal and postnatal care. Now, when a woman needs health care the most, following a rape, they have said no again.Women should be trusted to make their own health care decisions. In fact, it’s our constitutional right. Instead, we are subjected to extreme laws. It’s been happening for years, and it leaves all of us wondering what will come next. Considerations for the life and health of the mother could very well come under attack.
The governor and Republican lawmakers in Jefferson City have gone too far.I am not alone in feeling this way. In fact, Republicans, Democrats and independents in our state and across the nation are shocked by this law. This includes President Donald Trump, who came out in opposition to this cruel public policy of not making exceptions in the case of rape or incest.I’m frustrated to once again see Missouri portrayed this way, especially over an issue that is so personal to so many people.
Sometimes, the memories in the Capitol halls of Jefferson City are short. Even so, we all remember in 2012 when Todd Akin, the U.S. Senate nominee of the Republican Party, referred to “legitimate rape” and that a woman’s “body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down.” It made national headlines and was an embarrassment. Missourians refused to allow it.Missouri women need health care. Missouri families need to know they have access to the constitutional rights granted under Roe v. Wade.Instead, our state is once again at the forefront of extremism, because the governor is disrespecting women and delivering another dose of Akin. This time, it’s not just rhetoric, it’s the law.Nicole Galloway is the Missouri state auditor."
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"'Getting his sea legs back.'  After resigning from office, Greitens tries to steady his life — in private","Jun 2, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/getting-his-sea-legs-back-after-resigning-from-office-greitens/article_0b797d35-842b-56aa-ad2f-77f046890dd4.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — As governor, Eric Greitens was a secretive chief executive who worked hard to manage his own narrative by avoiding the press and appearing only in controlled settings.While that approach to governing melted under the heat of a scandal, it comes as no surprise the Republican has stayed off the radar in the year since he left office.No interviews. No public appearances. No news of his whereabouts.

But now, on the anniversary of Greitens’ departure, new information is beginning to seep out about Missouri’s 56th chief executive.For one, the Navy says the former Navy SEAL is making a return to the military, which he used as an asset during his 2016 campaign to become governor.Greitens, 45, is not going back into combat, but will serve as an officer in the Naval Reserve, a Navy information officer said.He’s also returned to writing, this time working on a book about his Jewish faith. It’s unclear whether he has a publisher lined up, and the former governor may have to answer for literary fraud accusations leveled against him in regard to his third book, “Resilience.”Through contacts with former employees of the governor’s office, the Post-Dispatch learned Greitens has hosted occasional cookouts at the $675,000 house he and his wife, University of Missouri political science professor Sheena Greitens, bought in the Warren County vacation town of Innsbrook after he became governor.“I think he’s doing well,” said former state Sen. John Lamping, a friend of Greitens. “I think it was a pretty crazy period and time. I know he’s spent most of the time just with his family, a lot of time out at Innsbrook.”Lamping says he hasn’t visited Innsbrook but said the two have met in between Innsbrook and Lamping’s home in Augusta. Lamping said Greitens hasn’t mentioned running for office again, but he said they do talk about the state of politics in Missouri.“He knows that I was pretty involved in trying to defeat this merger proposition,” Lamping said of the St. Louis-St. Louis County merger proposal known as Better Together. “We really just talk about that kind of stuff. He’s really just getting his sea legs back.”Rise, fall and aftermathGreitens’ entrance into the political scene in Missouri came in 2015. The political newcomer crafted a tough guy, outsider image to win his first race for office in the August 2016 Republican primary for governor.But in January 2018, news broke that Greitens had been having an affair at the same time he was launching his bid for office. Within five turbulent months, he would be gone.Greitens admitted he had an affair, but denied an allegation that he threatened the woman with a compromising photograph.Besides the affair, Greitens faced allegations of campaign finance violations, including using a charity donor list to raise campaign contributions — and then lying to the Missouri Ethics Commission about how he obtained the list.In announcing his resignation, Greitens said he did not deserve the onslaught: “I have not broken any laws or committed any offense worthy of this treatment.”Although it’s been a year since he left office on June 1, investigations continue related to his downfall.The Missouri Ethics Commission has not completed its report into a complaint filed by the chairman of the legislative investigatory panel. The complaint alleged multiple campaign finance violations.That has resulted in Greitens tapping his once formidable campaign fund for more than $1 million to pay teams of attorneys to defend him.Most of the campaign cash for attorneys went to the Husch Blackwell firm, where attorney Catherine Hanaway is a partner. Hanaway, who lost to Greitens in the 2016 GOP primary for governor, has represented Greitens in his various legal battles.Records show Greitens also continues to keep campaign aides on the payroll, including Scott Turk, who had been on the state payroll during a part of Greitens’ abbreviated 17 months in office.Gov. Mike Parson, the former lieutenant governor who succeeded Greitens, continues to defend the office in court against two Sunshine Law lawsuits related to Greitens’ time in office.Loose endsThe money in Greitens’ campaign fund is separate from a nonprofit that was formed after his election that raised almost $6.1 million from secret donors in 2017.The organization, known as A New Missouri, is a 501(c)(4) nonprofit that operated opaquely during Greitens’ abbreviated tenure. The organization does not appear to be active.Though the sources of the vast majority of the $6.1 million raised are unclear, the Center for Responsive Politics reported this month that A New Missouri received $500,000 from the Judicial Crisis Network, a secretive group that promotes conservative judges.Meanwhile, one of the targets of Greitens’ former legal defense team, St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kimberly Gardner, faces an investigation into how her office handled the prosecution of Greitens.
In mid-May, a special grand jury examining perjury allegations against an investigator hired by Gardner was extended for up to 60 days.The probe centers on William Don Tisaby, the private investigator Gardner picked to look into allegations against Greitens.The grand jury has been reviewing whether Tisaby deliberately lied during a deposition last year.Gardner’s office is still fighting in court over data stored on a Circuit Attorney’s Office server, which police seized April 29.The source of $120,000 in cash delivered to anti-Greitens attorney Albert Watkins is still unclear.Watkins represented the husband of Greitens’ ex-lover, and he disseminated transcripts of recorded conversations in which the woman described her affair with the future governor.Watkins said the money went toward his client’s legal bills, not to his client.“My client did not get a dime,” Watkins told the Post-Dispatch. “It went to pay attorneys fees.”Even the Navy has Greitens under a microscope.
On Friday, the Washington Post reported that the chief of naval operations, Adm. John Richardson, has called for a 30-day review of how the service handles personnel cases involving personal misconduct allegations, including Greitens’.In a May 26 email obtained by the Post, Richardson said Navy policies for addressing misconduct are “too cumbersome and slow” and the results could weaken “the ethical fiber of our Navy” and put the service “in a situation that is hard to explain to ourselves, and even more difficult to explain to the American people.”Staff moves onAfter the moving trucks pulled away from the Governor’s Mansion carrying the Greitens family’s possessions, the main core of his staff also exited their warren of offices on the Capitol’s second floor. Some went tearfully. Others said they were ready for a new, perhaps less stressful, chapter of their lives.His chief counsel, Lucinda Luetkemeyer, returned to private law practice. Her husband, Tony Luetkemeyer, was elected months later to a seat in the Missouri Senate.In her online biography, Luetkemeyer notes that she worked for the governor of Missouri, but doesn’t name Greitens as that governor.Greitens’ chief legislative aide, Will Scharf, left Missouri for a job in Washington.“While I was obviously disappointed with how our administration ended, serving the people of Missouri was a tremendous honor and privilege, and I am grateful to Gov. Greitens for giving me that opportunity,” Scharf said.Austin Chambers, a Georgia political operative who oversaw Greitens’ campaign for the seat and served as his political consultant after he was elected, is now the Republican State Leadership Committee president.In Chambers’ biography on the RSLC website, he lists a string of campaign victories, but also doesn’t use Greitens’ name.After departing as Greitens’ communications director, Parker Briden served as a spokesman for unsuccessful Nevada gubernatorial candidate Adam Laxalt. He is now spokesman for Mississippi Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves, who is running for governor there.Just a handful of staffers stuck around to work for Missouri’s current governor, Republican Mike Parson, who was sworn in the day Greitens left office.In taking over, Parson made it a mission to calm the waters in state government.Where Greitens openly fought with members of the General Assembly, Parson, a former lawmaker, sought to work with the Legislature to get his priorities passed into law.Despite multiple attempts over the past year, Greitens has not responded to interview requests from the Post-Dispatch.

Witness the most current example of our Missouri Legislature and Gov. Mike Parson garnering national headlines for making our wonderful state the poster child for a concerted attempt to overturn Roe v. Wade.

Although our state government has the chance to improve our sadly deteriorating roads, improve our schools by elevating teacher pay and pass a prescription drug monitoring law as one of the last states to do so, they choose instead to focus their time on issues that will give the citizens of our state the ignominious title of “Member, Gang of Women’s Rights Deniers of 2019.” What a choice.

I applaud Gov. Mike Parson; Sens. Ed Emery, Caleb Rowden, Tony Luetkemeyer and Dan Hegeman; as well as Reps. David Gregory, Nick Schroer, Glen Kolkmeyer and Rob Vescovo for championing these important efforts.Despite these successes, work remains to be done. The Legislature again failed to pass much-needed consumer protection reform, refusing to address the trial bar’s blatant abuses of the Missouri Merchandising Practices Act. Such reform was introduced five years ago, yet lawmakers continue to manufacture reasons for inaction. It is beyond dispute that cases come from all over the country to St. Louis because of lax venue rules and lucrative damages available under this act. Excessive tort costs in Missouri result in $1.6 billion in annual direct costs to the state’s economy.

The Legislature also failed to advance an asbestos trust transparency bill and punitive damages reform. The Missouri Association of Trial Attorneys lobbied against these efforts and the Senate succumbed to the pressure.
The governor has made it clear that civil justice reform is an important priority for his administration, yet he can only sign those bills sent to his desk. The onus falls on the Legislature to pass additional bills that will rid the state of its “show-me-your lawsuit” nickname and St. Louis’ status as a judicial hellhole.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Gov. Mike Parson ends first year in office facing onslaught from abortion rights activists,"Jun 1, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/gov-mike-parson-ends-first-year-in-office-facing-onslaught/article_739dcd19-63cb-5de9-962c-790ab4ca1237.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — Gov. Mike Parson signed an anti-abortion law on May 24, banning the procedure at eight weeks of pregnancy, except in medical emergencies.Controversy over the law, however, did not subside after he signed the law.Parson, a Republican, finished his first year in office on Saturday facing a public relations and legal onslaught from abortion-rights activists and Democrats who wield little to no power in Jefferson City.

The new abortion law has generated backlash in three ways: the ACLU of Missouri and GOP mega-donor David Humphreys have started parallel campaigns to repeal the law; opponents are expected to challenge the constitutionality of the law in court; and, politically, Democrats seek to translate anger among some constituencies into success at the polls.The measure has stirred unease among several Republicans, who worry about the popularity of strict abortion laws approved here and in other states.President Donald Trump recently broke with Missouri lawmakers, saying he supported abortion rights in cases of rape or incest, and Humphreys, who with his family spent $14 million on Republican causes during the 2016 election cycle, has also said the law goes too far.On another front, St. Louis Circuit Judge Michael Stelzer issued a temporary restraining order Friday blocking the state from revoking the license of the St. Louis Planned Parenthood clinic, handing a loss to the governor. On Wednesday Parson said such a court order would be “reckless.”On May 17, facing questions about why he would sign a bill without rape or incest exceptions, Parson predicted the courts would have the final say on the eight-week ban — not activists on both sides of the abortion issue.“I believe in the pro-life side of the issue,” Parson told reporters, later adding he believed all life had value, no matter how it was conceived.“There’s going to be challenges to this. You all know. This all started in 1973,” he said. “There’s going to be court challenges to this issue throughout the years to come.”That same day, activists chanted outside Parson’s Capitol office as House Republicans advanced the ban on abortions after eight-weeks. Once the bill was on Parson’s desk, they bombarded his office with phone calls and emails.

According to the governor’s office, roughly 3,000 calls and 1,600 emails related to the abortion law came into the office between May 16 and May 23.It was unclear how many contacts were in opposition, but, “typically, calls are made more in opposition,” spokesman Steele Shippy said of calls to the office on any given issue.Some activists said they couldn’t get through. Alison Dreith, deputy director at the Hope Clinic for Women in Granite City, said she tried calling three times but did not speak to a real person nor did she receive a voicemail prompt.“If Gov. Parson was not keeping track of people who supported or opposed this bill … now we will never know” how many people opposed the bill, she said.
On Thursday, with the bill already signed into law, activists confronted the governor as he stepped onto the elevator at the University Club Tower in Richmond Heights to film an episode of “This Week in Missouri Politics” with publisher Scott Faughn.Hundreds of other activists protested in downtown St. Louis, chanting near the governor’s St. Louis office, calling on him to resign. Police said Friday they arrested 16 protesters.

Planned Parenthood lawsuit
Fueling the activists’ fury was a separate Parson administration flare-up over abortion.On Tuesday, Planned Parenthood launched a media blitz — holding a mid-morning press call with national and local outlets to announce the organization’s St. Louis abortion clinic would likely be forced to cease abortions on Friday, the result of a licensing dispute between Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region and the state Department of Health and Senior Services.That morning, the group also filed a lawsuit accusing the state of illegally threatening renewal of the clinic’s license.“Just like the Trump administration and the state politicians they embolden, Missouri Governor Parson’s inspections process has become just another vehicle to intimidate doctors like me and to push abortion care out of reach for patients,” Dr. Colleen McNicholas, obstetrician-gynecologist at the St. Louis Planned Parenthood location, said in a statement.Parson held his own news conference the next afternoon, flanked by top advisers and Dr. Randall Williams, a licensed obstetrician and the director of the DHSS.“Yesterday Planned Parenthood filed a lawsuit against the state and (that) coincided with a media campaign by Planned Parenthood,” Parson said.Parson said the state health department found “a series of deficiencies” at the clinic.He did not elaborate, citing an ongoing investigation, but the DHSS later put out a news release saying concerns were initially raised after inspections in March.The agency cited “at least one incident in which patient safety was gravely compromised.” It also cited what it called “failed surgical abortions” in which women remained pregnant, and an alleged failure to obtain “informed consent.”The Associated Presscontributed to this report.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri's only abortion clinic stays open for now,"Jun 1, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/missouri-s-only-abortion-clinic-stays-open-for-now/article_f8be0cd2-83a3-5ee6-85eb-ae874b36e316.html,"ST. LOUIS — Missouri's only abortion clinic won a temporary reprieve in court on Friday, and may continue providing abortions for now, a St. Louis judge ruled.St. Louis Circuit Judge Michael Stelzer granted a request from Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region for a temporary restraining order that stopped the clinic's license from expiring at midnight on Friday. But Stelzer's ruling effectively extends the license for only a few days. He scheduled a hearing at 9 a.m. Tuesday for further debate.

Still, supporters were relieved. ""The fight goes on,"" Dr. Colleen McNicholas, an obstetrician-gynecologist at the St. Louis clinic, said in a statement. ""While temporary, we celebrate today, and tomorrow we go back to work to ensure access to abortion does not go dark at the last health center that provides abortion in Missouri.""The news disappointed some abortion opponents, but they remained hopeful. “It’s inevitable they’re going to lose,” said Rita Frances Ward. “Because God wins.”Stelzer's order comes a day after hearing arguments over Planned Parenthood's future here, and a week after Gov. Mike Parson signed one of the nation's strictest abortion laws. The two events have together turned the nation's attention on Missouri, one of several states to pass stricter abortion laws. Activists on both sides protested in St. Louis on Thursday and Friday. Police arrested sixteen abortion-rights advocates Thursday after a protest spilled into the Wainwright building downtown. On Friday, abortion opponents gathered in front of Planned Parenthood's Central West End clinic, 4251 Forest Park Avenue.












        

        
            Michael Stelzer's order in Planned Parenthood case





Last Friday, Parson signed the law prohibiting most abortions eight weeks into a pregnancy. It takes effect Aug. 28.On Tuesday, Planned Parenthood sued the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services, alleging the state agency was illegally refusing to renew the St. Louis abortion clinic's yearly license until the department could complete an investigation into an unspecified patient complaint.The legal fight stems from the state's Department of Health and Human Services' request to interview seven physicians, all of whom had worked at the clinic, as part of the investigation. Five of the doctors, who aren't employed by Planned Parenthood but come from local university medical programs to treat patients at the clinic, have refused to be interviewed as part of the state's investigation.Planned Parenthood said it has no power to compel those doctors to speak to the department about the investigation, which began in April after a routine inspection a month earlier. The clinic said the March 11-13 inspection included interviews with doctors and staff and cited some ""non-remarkable"" deficiencies — such as failing to ensure all staff participated in a fire drill. The inspection also cited Planned Parenthood for the timing of a pelvic exam and the clinic's failure to ensure that the same doctor who provided an ""informed consent visit"" three days before an abortion was also the one performing the procedure. The clinic says it submitted a correction plan as required.
A lawyer for DHSS argued Thursday that the doctors' refusal to be interviewed as part of the investigation is ""unprecedented"" and that the clinic has the burden of forcing the physicians to cooperate. He said it is common to seek interviews with people who work in health care facilities as part of the license renewal process.On Friday, Stelzer said he was not ruling on the merits of the controversy. The state argued that there was ""no prospect"" it would decide whether to renew the clinic's license before midnight Friday.""Petitioner has demonstrated that immediate and irreparable injury will result if petitioner's license is allowed to expire,"" Stelzer wrote.
About 60 abortion opponents protested on Friday outside Planned Parenthood, hoping Stelzer would side with the state. Some carried “Choose Life” signs. Others prayed the rosary. Some hoped to deter women coming in for abortions.Every few minutes, cars on Forest Park Avenue honked loudly in support. One driver cheered as she waited at a stoplight.“It’s electric,” said Kathy Forck of New Bloomfield, Mo. “You can feel the excitement in the air. We can hardly wait.”But by the early afternoon, news of Stelzer's decision had reached the clinic sidewalk.A handful of abortion-rights supporters counter-protesting a few feet away erupted in high-fives and celebration, nearly drowning out Ward, the abortion opponent, who was singing the third verse of “Amazing Grace” into a microphone.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Don't remove health care from vulnerable residents,"May 31, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/mailbag/don-t-remove-health-care-from-vulnerable-residents/article_207d745d-6799-5216-a418-fcf1e3a6eaa8.html,"Regarding ""Revelations cast doubt on Missouri's claim that 'improved economy' shrunk Medicaid rolls"" (April 26): Imagine that your child is sick. You are under the impression you have health insurance and go to the doctor, only to learn you have lost that insurance with no notice. You are forced to choose between a sick child and a huge medical bill. This is what’s happening to tens of thousands of Missourians.A disturbing 85,000 Missourians and counting have lost Medicaid benefits since January 2018. About 67,000 are children. Families on Medicaid are among the most vulnerable Missourians and should be protected.

Though Gov. Mike Parson's administration has claimed that an improving economy has resulted in fewer people needing Medicaid, the reality is that bureaucratic hurdles have prevented their paperwork from being properly processed. They have lost care because Medicaid data is not being handled in compliance with federal law, not because people are suddenly able to access private health insurance.
It will fall to others to pay for whatever money Parson claims to be in the budget because his administration has forced people off benefits. When uninsured Missourians are unable to access preventive care, they are instead forced go to an emergency room when they become acutely sick. On top of the exorbitant costs of these visits, Parson’s policy will lead to sicker children.
The governor must re-enroll everyone who lost Medicaid benefits to prevent more Missourians and their children from losing life-saving coverage.Rachel Grand • St. Louis"

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,GOP mega-donor David Humphreys endorses effort to overturn Missouri abortion law,"May 31, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/gop-mega-donor-david-humphreys-endorses-effort-to-overturn-missouri/article_5042b028-f598-58a8-8f43-a8be7f659eca.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — Republican mega-donor David Humphreys on Friday endorsed an effort to overturn an anti-abortion law Gov. Mike Parson signed last week.Parson, also a Republican, signed House Bill 126 last Friday. The law takes effect Aug. 28 and bans abortions at eight weeks of pregnancy, except when there is a medical emergency. There are no exceptions allowing abortions in cases of rape or incest.Humphreys endorsed the Committee to Protect the Rights of Victims of Rape and Incest. As of Friday, there were no records on the Missouri Ethics Commission's website showing the group had filed any registration paperwork.

Attorney Lowell Pearson, who often represents Republican clients, filed two questions with the secretary of state's office Friday. Both seek a public referendum on the abortion law in November 2020.""I support the Committee’s referendum petition to overturn HB126,"" Humphreys said in a statement. ""Abortion is (a) very personal subject with complicated moral issues for all involved. With no consideration given to victims of rape and incest, this legislation’s impact reflects bad public policy with negative consequences for Missourians. As such, I support the Committee’s effort to protect women in the case of rape or incest. ""I invite other like-minded people to join in the Committee’s efforts and with financial and personal support of its signature gathering and campaign,"" he said.Sara Baker, legislative director for the ACLU of Missouri, said Humphreys' effort was separate from the ACLU's. On Tuesday, the ACLU filed its own referendum with the same end goal of convincing voters to veto the law.
""They are filing their own referendum,"" she said.To place a question on the ballot, proponents of either effort will have to collect more than 100,000 signatures around the state by Aug. 28 to stop the law from going into effect.The legislation Parson signed also bans a woman from aborting a fetus that might have Down syndrome. It requires both parents or guardians to be notified before minors can get an abortion, in most cases.
The measure says anyone “who knowingly performs or induces an abortion” in cases that are not exempted by the legislation would be guilty of a Class B felony, which carries a minimum five-year prison sentence.If the Supreme Court overturns Roe vs. Wade, “in whole or in part,” the legislation states that all abortions would be made illegal except in cases of a medical emergency.Humphreys, whose Tamko Building Products makes roofing shingles, has funneled millions of dollars toward GOP causes in recent years, including to the election of U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley and to the House Republican fundraising arm.During the 2016 election cycle, Humphreys and his family contributed more than $14 million to Republicans.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Despite pollution concerns, Missouri governor OKs law stopping counties from regulating farms","May 31, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/despite-pollution-concerns-missouri-governor-oks-law-stopping-counties-from/article_c8279aee-6cfe-510b-a633-f1aeeb2500ad.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — Over the objections of environmental groups and Democrats, Gov. Mike Parson quietly signed Friday a measure stopping local governments from regulating big farms.The legislation, which was the focus of a 12-hour, overnight filibuster in the Missouri Senate this spring, will bar counties from imposing their own pollution-fighting rules on concentrated animal feeding operations, known as CAFOs.The signing came as Parson, who also owns a cattle operation in his hometown of Bolivar, spent the week observing “beef month” with leaders of the Missouri Cattlemen’s Association.

Twenty counties, mostly in the northern half of the state, have sought to regulate large animal operations through local health ordinances. But the new law says counties cannot enact rules more stringent than state standards.Proponents say the local ordinances create a “hodgepodge” of regulations that have stalled expansion of modern agriculture techniques in the state.But opponents — flanked by a vocal statewide network of neighbors affected by the facilities — have said state regulations are lacking, allowing the big farms to run amok and endanger the environment.Passage of the legislation earlier this month came after thousands of Missourians called on lawmakers to drop the legislation.Brian Smith of the Missouri Rural Crisis Center said counties enacted their own rules because state regulators lack the power to protect citizens.“Legislators in Jefferson City and the governor heard loud and clear that the vast majority of Missourians were opposed to Senate Bill 391, yet they chose to side with corporate interests over rural communities,” Smith said after the legislation was approved.
Parson, during a news conference May 17, defended the state’s standards and the Department of Natural Resource’s ability to regulate the large operations.“I’m confident that DNR can handle that to make sure that’s done,” he said. “We’re going to make sure the environment’s protected; we’re going to make sure people’s rights are protected.”Democrats did win a concession during their filibuster: setback requirements for what are known as “export only” CAFOs — operations that ship manure to other farms.
The Democrats were concerned that owners could spray anywhere, with no safeguards for streams or public lands. Some farms near CAFOs welcome the manure, which is a fertilizer that can be offered for free.Parson will highlight the new law when he attends an annual steak fry in Sedalia hosted by the Missouri Cattlemen’s Association on June 9.“We’ve now opened the doors that will allow Missouri to lead the way in meeting a growing world food demand and ensure we keep more agriculture production in our state, strengthening Missouri’s number one industry,” the governor said in a statement Friday.A coalition of farm groups also has praised the law, saying uniform regulations will provide certainty to farmers and ranchers throughout Missouri.“This bill will ensure we use the latest science so that our animals are raised in healthy environments and our water and air remain clean. Missouri farms should be governed by science-based rules and expert oversight, not reactionary fear mongering,” the statement noted.The legislation is Senate Bill 391.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Police arrested 16 on Thursday after pro-choice rally in downtown St. Louis,"May 31, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/police-arrested-on-thursday-after-pro-choice-rally-in-downtown/article_946f023a-a335-5459-8329-898e0df84c22.html,"Updated at 10:40 a.m. Friday with arrest details.  ST. LOUIS — Police arrested Alderman Megan Ellyia Green and several board members of Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region on Thursday after a downtown protest over Missouri's new abortion law — and the state's attempt to close Missouri's only remaining abortion clinic.Green and others sat down in the lobby of the Wainwright State Office Building after a protest in a park between the Gateway Arch and the historic Old Courthouse.

By the time the bulk of the protesters had marched from the park, Green and the others were seated in the lobby of the Wainwright building and security guards had barred and locked the doors.Green livestreamed on Facebook as protesters inside chanted, sang and vowed not to leave until the Planned Parenthood clinic was given a permit to operate.Outside, a larger group chanted slogans, including, ""Hey hey, ho ho, Parson has got to go,” referring to Gov. Mike Parson, who on Friday, signed a bill prohibiting most abortions after eight weeks. Parson has offices in the building.Police ordered protesters out, and began arresting them one by one at about 2:30 p.m. About a dozen were placed in two police transport vans as protesters cheered, clapped and chanted.
Police said on Friday that they arrested 16 for trespassing. Two were issued summons and released and 14 were booked. The protest began about an hour after the start of a 10:30 a.m. hearing in St. Louis Circuit Court in a lawsuit seeking to block the expiration of Planned Parenthood's license. The group sued Tuesday, claiming the state was illegally refusing to reissue that license. A judge did not  rule in the case.Protest organizers could not immediately provide a list of those arrested, but among them were Joan Bray, a former state senator and representative, and Planned Parenthood board members Dana Sandweiss and Maureen Michel Jordan. Sandweiss is also on the board of the ACLU.
On Facebook, Jordan said she was engaging in an act of civil disobedience and cited a friend's botched abortion in 1969.A police spokesman could not immediately provide information on the arrests or the potential charges.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Battle over abortion in Missouri intensifies with arrests and court fight,"May 31, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/battle-over-abortion-in-missouri-intensifies-with-arrests-and-court/article_bb641898-b178-5013-921c-272af70ed8a0.html,"ST. LOUIS — The battle over abortion in Missouri intensified on Thursday, first in a courtroom, and then under the Gateway Arch.A St. Louis judge heard arguments Thursday morning from lawyers for Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region and the state of Missouri over the future of the state's only abortion clinic. Planned Parenthood is asking for a temporary order that would prevent the state from allowing the clinic's license to expire at midnight Friday.Judge Michael Stelzer's decision, expected Friday, could determine whether Missouri becomes the nation's first state without a functioning abortion clinic.

""Missouri politicians and Missouri government are weaponizing the licensing and regulatory process to end safe and legal abortions in Missouri,"" M’Evie Mead, the director of Planned Parenthood Advocates of Missouri, said on the courthouse steps after the hearing.Meanwhile, hundreds began gathering just a few blocks away at a park in front of the Arch, to protest Missouri Gov. Mike Parson's signing last week of one of the country's most restrictive abortion laws. Some marched from the park to the lobby of the Wainwright building, where Parson has an office, and refused to leave.Police arrested about a dozen, including St. Louis Alderman Megan Ellyia Green, former State Senator Joan Bray, and several Planned Parenthood board members.Planned Parenthood sued the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services on Tuesday, alleging the state agency was illegally refusing to renew the St. Louis abortion clinic's yearly license until the department could complete an investigation into an unspecified patient complaint.At issue is the state's demand to interview seven physicians, all of whom had worked at the clinic, as part of an investigation the clinic says began last month. Five of the doctors, who aren't employed by Planned Parenthood but come from local university medical programs to treat patients at the Central West End clinic, have refused to be interviewed as part of the state's investigation.The clinic's lawyer, Jamie Boyer, argued Thursday that it has no power to compel those doctors to speak to the department about the investigation, which began in April after a routine inspection a month earlier. The clinic said the March 11-13 inspection included interviews with doctors and staff and cited some ""non-remarkable"" deficiencies that the clinic says it corrected.The inspection cited Planned Parenthood for the timing of a pelvic exam and the clinic's failure to ensure that the same doctor who provided an ""informed consent visit"" three days before an abortion was also the one performing it. The clinic says it submitted a correction plan as required.""There is no justification for shutting our doors now,"" Boyer told the judge. ""The department is conditioning our ability to renew our license on these interviews. We couldn't comply even if we wanted to. They're not our employees.""John Sauer, a lawyer for DHSS, argued Thursday that the doctors' refusal to be interviewed as part of the investigation is ""unprecedented"" and that the clinic has the burden of forcing the physicians to cooperate. He said it is common to seek interviews with people who work in health care facilities as part of the license renewal process.""We've raised serious concerns that need to be addressed,"" Sauer said of the department's investigation.The impasse between the state and Planned Parenthood, Sauer said, was ""created by the refusal of the doctors to cooperate and the failure of the regulated entity to induce them to cooperate."" He also said Planned Parenthood shouldn't have sued — its complaints should have been heard by a license renewal commission instead of state courts.
On Friday, Parson signed a law prohibiting most abortions eight weeks into a pregnancy. The law takes effect Aug. 28.The Republican governor said during a press conference Wednesday that in addition to not enabling interviews, Planned Parenthood had not corrected several ""deficiencies"" at the St. Louis clinic. He declined to elaborate.Mead, the Planned Parenthood director, said the organization has complied with state's ""goalpost-moving behavior.""Stelzer's decision is expected before midnight Friday. He'll weigh whether DHSS's interpretation of Missouri rules for renewing licenses conflicts with state law as well as whether the state's failure to renew Planned Parenthood's license interferes with a woman's constitutional right to an abortion.
The protests started just after 11:30 a.m. Thursday. Protesters marched west from the Arch down Market Street, leading chants and calling for Parson's removal from office. Some crowded the lobby of the Wainwright building, which holds state offices, vowing to stay until Planned Parenthood's license was renewed. Alderman Green livestreamed the event on Facebook.Police ordered them out and began arresting them one by one at about 2:30 p.m. They were placed into two police transport vans as protesters outside cheered, clapped and chanted.Protest organizers could not immediately provide a list of those arrested, but among them were Planned Parenthood board members Dana Sandweiss and Maureen Michel Jordan. Sandweiss is also on the board of the ACLU.On Facebook, Jordan said she was engaging in an act of civil disobedience and cited a friend's botched abortion in 1969.A police spokesman could not immediately provide information on the arrests or the potential charges.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,License of Missouri's only abortion clinic in St. Louis judge's hands,"May 30, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/license-of-missouri-s-only-abortion-clinic-in-st-louis/article_6733d111-80de-50a4-92af-64fa965f54ce.html,"ST. LOUIS — Missouri's only abortion clinic's fight to keep its doors open rests with one man: Michael Stelzer.On Thursday, the St. Louis judge heard arguments from lawyers for Planned Parenthood and the state of Missouri over the clinic's future. The clinic is asking for a temporary order that would prevent its license from expiring at midnight Friday.













St. Louis Circuit Judge Michael Stelzer




Stelzer took the case under advisement and has yet to make a ruling. His decision could determine whether Missouri becomes the nation's first state without at least one functioning abortion clinic.The legal fight in St. Louis comes within a week of the Missouri governor signing one of the country's most restrictive abortion laws.Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region sued the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services on Tuesday, alleging the state agency was illegally refusing to renew the St. Louis abortion clinic's yearly license until the department could complete an investigation into an unspecified patient complaint.At issue is the state's demand to interview seven physicians, all who had worked at the clinic, as part of an investigation the clinic says began last month. Five of the doctors, who aren't employed by Planned Parenthood but come from local university medical programs to treat patients at the Central West End clinic, have refused to be interviewed as part of the state's investigation.

Jack Suntrup





The clinic's lawyer, Jamie Boyer, argued Thursday that it has no power to compel those doctors to speak to the department about an unspecified investigation, which began in April after a routine inspection a month earlier. The clinic said the March 11-13 inspection included interviews with doctors and staff and cited some ""non-remarkable"" deficiencies that the clinic says it corrected.The inspection cited Planned Parenthood for the timing of a pelvic exam and the clinic's failure to ensure that the same doctor who provided an ""informed consent visit"" three days before the abortion was the one performing it. The clinic says it submitted a correction plan as required.""There is no justification for shutting our doors now,"" Boyer told the judge. ""The department is conditioning our ability to renew our license on these interviews. We couldn't comply even if we wanted to. They're not our employees.""John Sauer, a lawyer for DHSS argued Thursday that the doctors' refusal to be interviewed as part of the investigation is ""unprecedented"" and that the clinic has the burden of forcing the physicians to cooperate. He said it is common to seek interviews with people who work in health-care facilities as part of the license renewal process.
""We've raised serious concerns that need to be addressed,"" Sauer said of the department's investigation.The impasse between the the state and Planned Parenthood, Sauer said, was ""created by the refusal of the doctors to cooperate and the failure of the regulated entity to induce them to cooperate."" He also said Planned Parenthood shouldn't have sued — its complaints should have been heard by a license renewal commission instead of state courts.On Friday, Gov. Mike Parson signed a new anti-abortion law prohibiting most abortions eight weeks into a pregnancy. The eight-week abortion ban takes effect Aug. 28.The Republican governor said during a press conference Wednesday that in addition to not enabling interviews, Planned Parenthood had not corrected several ""deficiencies"" at the St. Louis clinic. He declining to elaborate.
After Thursday's hearing on the courthouse steps, M’Evie Mead, the director of Planned Parenthood Advocates of Missouri, said the organization has complied with state's ""goalpost-moving behavior.""""Missouri politicians and Missouri government are weaponizing the licensing and regulatory process to end safe and legal abortions in Missouri,"" Mead said.Stelzer's decision is expected before midnight Friday. He'll weigh whether DHSS's interpretation of Missouri rules for renewing licenses conflicts with state law and if the state's failure to renew Planned Parenthood's license interferes with a woman's constitutional right to an abortion.In downtown St. Louis on Thursday, protesters against Missouri's new abortion law marched from the Gateway Arch west on Market Street, leading chants and calling for Parson's removal from office. Some crowded the lobby of the Wainwright Building, which holds state offices, vowing to stay until Planned Parenthood's license is renewed. Police arrested several protesters about 2:30 p.m.— Robert Patrick of the Post-Dispatch contributed to this report.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"In run-up to 2020, Parson fundraising haul outpacing 2016 candidates","May 30, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/in-run-up-to-parson-fundraising-haul-outpacing-candidates/article_8c3a4fe5-f835-56c4-9065-18e6f99a166b.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — When it comes to collecting the campaign cash needed to make a run for governor in 2020, Gov. Mike Parson is outpacing the group of Republicans who sought the seat in 2016.With more than $3 million spread across two campaign accounts, Parson is ahead of where the four GOP candidates for governor stood at the same time in 2015.Former Missouri House Speaker Catherine Hanaway had the most in her account at $1.2 million with 14 months to go before voters headed to the polls in 2016, according to Missouri Ethics Commission records. Businessman John Brunner, former Lt. Gov. Peter Kinder and eventual nominee Eric Greitens each had under $1 million in their campaign war chests.

“I am pleased with the progress of the fundraising at this point,” said John Hancock, a former Missouri Republican Party chief who is spearheading fundraising for Parson. “I would like to see us ramp things up in the next quarter, but overall I am pleased.”Parson has not announced whether he will run for a full term as he closes out his first year as chief executive after taking over for the scandal-plagued Greitens.But, in a sign he and his supporters are ramping up their fundraising to make a bid for a full four years, his campaign accounts have collected at least $250,000 since May 1.On Wednesday, his political action committee Uniting Missouri reported $165,000 in contributions from a fundraiser co-sponsored by lobbyist and former Missouri House Speaker Steve Tilley.Tilley represents a number of companies seeking licenses and contracts to operate in Missouri’s new medical marijuana program. The Parson administration is in the midst of reviewing contracts and writing rules for the program.
Other donors were Sterling Bancshares of Poplar Bluff and MACO Development Company of Clarkton. Each are involved in the low-income housing development tax credit business.Greitens put the tax credits on hold, arguing they’d become a cash cow for developers. Parson could restart the program after lawmakers failed to send him any of the reforms he’d sought.
Other donors in May include Anheuser-Busch and W.G. Wade Shows, which holds the contract to provide carnival rides at the Missouri State Fair in Sedalia.Wade Shows, which contributed $15,000 to Uniting Missouri on May 21, is among two companies that have held the contract to provide rides at the fair for the past 12 years. The Florida-based company has three more years left on the contract.Sami Jo Freeman, a spokeswoman for the Missouri Department of Agriculture said the fair does not pay the companies to provide the carnival rides.“In fact, the fair is contracted to receive a percentage of the ride sales and a flat rate for games-concession sales,” Freeman said.The campaign fund could grow more after a planned fundraiser in the St. Louis area Thursday night.Among Democrats potentially seeking the state’s top job, Sen. Scott Sifton of Affton reported having $313,000 on hand as of April 1. Auditor Nicole Galloway has $65,798 in her account after raising $114,194 in the first quarter. Neither has formally announced their future political plans.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,'I'm not sure if ego is involved or what': Democratic feud brewing in St. Louis County,"May 30, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/i-m-not-sure-if-ego-is-involved-or-what/article_413d3b91-09a2-592e-9502-dcfe09926932.html,"ST. LOUIS COUNTY — Mark Osmack wants to represent a Missouri Senate district that stretches from Glendale to Ellisville. So does state Rep. Deb Lavender, a Kirkwood Democrat.Osmack, also a Democrat from Kirkwood, said he announced his candidacy on May 21 after Lavender assured him she would not run. But this week, Lavender changed her mind. Osmack says she broke her promise to stay out of the race. And he isn’t happy about it.“This is all of her making, so I’m not sure if ego is involved or what,” Osmack told the Post-Dispatch.

He said Lavender informed him of her decision on Memorial Day — a holiday revered by Osmack, who is an Army veteran.“She told me this on Memorial Day,” he said. “And I’m a veteran and I’ve lost friends in Afghanistan and Iraq. Bad move. You want to talk about tone deaf, you want to talk about not being aware of the issues that really matter, that’s how you show it.”Lavender said she apologized to Osmack for changing her mind, but declined to comment further on the dispute. She could serve one more term in the House before being forced out by term limits, but decided to run for the Senate.“I have struggled with that decision for the last week and a half,” Lavender said. “I have until very recently been content to finish up my four terms in the House.”She said the passage of an anti-abortion bill supported by Sen. Andrew Koenig, R-Manchester, made her realize “how extreme my state senator is.”With two Democrats running in the 15th Senate District, the August 2020 primary will decide which candidate will face Koenig in the November election.The district is one of only a couple that Democrats acknowledge they could conceivably flip from Republican control next year, because of a suburban electorate that has warmed to Democrats in the last several election cycles.The district boundary is roughly Glendale to the east, Ellisville to the west and Ballwin to the north, with the southern boundary running along the southern St. Louis County line.When asked why Democrats should choose Osmack, 37, over Lavender, he said: “One, I’m a veteran. We have no Democratic veterans in the state Senate. … We also need new direction as a party. Democrats are outnumbered 3-1. Their game plan hasn’t worked, and if we don’t change it’s not going to work.“We do have the name ID because I ran for Congress last year,” Osmack said. “She is known in Kirkwood. I think she’s retired, I don’t know, but she’s in her 60s. I think a new brand of leadership that is young, energetic, vibrant is needed.”
Lavender, 62, is a physical therapist who runs her own practice on Manchester Road. She is not retired.After this article was published online Thursday, Osmack called a reporter and said he didn’t mean to denigrate Lavender’s age, and added that he regretted those comments.When asked why she felt she was the best Democrat, Lavender said: “I think I have a proven track record of working hard for a campaign, being able to raise money and have proven my leadership in the House in this position working for the people of Missouri.”
Lavender has hoofed her Kirkwood-based district for more than a decade. She first ran for the Missouri House in 2008, losing three times before finally winning the previously Republican-held 90th House District in 2014.In 2016, she easily defeated her GOP opponent, winning nearly 57% of the vote. No Republican ran against her in 2018, a likely reflection of the shifting politics of suburban areas like Kirkwood, and Lavender’s name recognition and popularity within her district.Osmack ran for Congress last year, placing second in a crowded Democratic primary for the 2nd Congressional District.Lavender and Osmack are seeking to paint Koenig as too “extreme” for the district. Koenig, 36, helped shepherd the anti-abortion law Gov. Mike Parson signed last week.Koenig is a member of the six-member Senate Conservative Caucus, which sought to stymie much of Parson’s agenda this past legislative session. The group embarked on a 27-hour filibuster in a failed effort to derail a package of incentives for General Motors’ Wentzville plant.Parson’s plan included other “workforce development” tools, including a new $10 million scholarship program.Koenig, in an interview, said he had worked on issues like foster care and said he opposed “corporate welfare.” He said issues such as these appeal to most voters.And, Koenig said he was not too extreme. But, he suggested Osmack was. (The interview took place before Lavender’s candidacy was confirmed.)“I think my opponent, Osmack — although I haven’t heard a lot from him — he’s probably going to be more extreme — on the left side — than what my district would represent,” Koenig said.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Hearing on the fate of St. Louis abortion clinic postponed until Thursday,"May 30, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/hearing-on-the-fate-of-st-louis-abortion-clinic-postponed/article_8ac3b4d5-9434-5135-84d6-5465bb51f12a.html,"Attorneys for Planned Parenthood and the state of Missouri had been scheduled to meet in court Wednesday afternoon in a dispute that will likely determine the fate of the state's only licensed abortion clinic.But, Circuit Judge Michael Stelzer said in open court, a hearing on the case had been postponed until 10:30 a.m. Thursday.""Due to facts out of everybody's control here, this case will be given a brief continuance,"" Stelzer said.

Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region sued the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services on Tuesday, alleging the state agency was ""unlawfully"" holding up renewal of the St. Louis abortion clinic's license until the department could finish an investigation into an unidentified patient complaint.The clinic, in the Central West End, will see its license expire on May 31 unless the state relents and renews the license, or the court intervenes.If the clinic stops performing abortions after Friday, Missouri will be the only state in the country without at least one abortion clinic, according to Planned Parenthood officials.














        
            Planned Parenthood lawsuit




DHSS, as part of its complaint investigation, is seeking to interview several physicians who had worked at the clinic, even though most of the physicians are not employed by Planned Parenthood, the lawsuit says.The clinic argues in the suit that it has no power to compel those physicians to speak to the department.On Friday, Gov. Mike Parson signed one of the most restrictive abortion laws in the country. Most of the law's provisions — including one prohibiting most abortions eight weeks into a pregnancy — do not take effect until Aug. 28.
Parson, a Republican, told reporters on Wednesday that in addition to not arranging interviews, Planned Parenthood had not corrected several ""deficiencies"" at the St. Louis clinic, declining to elaborate.""They still have two more days to comply,"" Parson said. ""They've got to answer for the deficiencies to the Department of Health.""Planned Parenthood, in its lawsuit, contends it has addressed all of the state's concerns.Joel Currier of the Post-Dispatch contributed to this report.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Editorial: Missouri's latest attack on abortion rights is a reminder: Elections have consequences.,"May 29, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-missouri-s-latest-attack-on-abortion-rights-is-a/article_53fe3bc4-1adb-54dc-9437-d2a4957a860a.html,"The ink was barely dry on Missouri’s draconian new anti-abortion-rights law before state regulators delivered the second blow against women’s control over their own bodies. Using — and blatantly abusing — their official licensing powers, regulators are threatening to shut down the last abortion provider in Missouri when its license expires Friday.Contrast that with Illinois, where Democrats control state government: In response to the coordinated attacks on women’s self-determination in Missouri and other red states, the Illinois Legislature is moving to shore up those rights.The difference confirms the axiom that elections have consequences. In Missouri, low-income women, rape victims and others who are targeted in these new forced-birth policies are facing the consequences of voters allowing the reactionary right to take over the state.

The Missouri law that Republican Gov. Mike Parson signed Friday outlaws all abortions after eight weeks — when many women don’t yet know they’re pregnant — with the exception of abortions to save the life of the mother. There are no rape or incest exceptions.It’s one of a recent series of laws in red states that blatantly violate the abortion-rights protections under Roe v. Wade. That’s the whole point: Anti-choice activists hope the inevitable court challenges will get them before today’s conservative U.S. Supreme Court, with possibility of overturning Roe.But Missouri’s state health regulators, apparently unwilling to wait for that national showdown, have now maneuvered to shut down the Planned Parenthood clinic in St. Louis — the last abortion provider in the state — with intimidation tactics that make a mockery of American democratic traditions.
As part of Planned Parenthood’s license-renewal process, the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services, which answers to Parson, is suddenly demanding interviews with doctors and others on staff, while making clear those interviews could lead to criminal proceedings or board review for the doctors. The obvious goal is to intimidate Planned Parenthood into refusing the interviews — which it has — so it can be denied its license renewal on Friday. Litigation is pending.It’s bad enough that politicians are writing laws to undercut women’s rights to their own medical decisions, but now bureaucrats controlled by those politicians are misusing their regulatory power to go beyond even what these new laws would allow.
All of this, remember, is in service to one ultimate goal: To ensure that any woman who becomes pregnant, even via rape, can be forced by the government to carry the pregnancy to term.Missouri voters in recent elections have handed their state over to an increasingly extremist party with which they disagree (judging from recent ballot measures) on the minimum wage, political ethics, organized labor and other issues. Now, elected extremists are attacking the fundamental biological rights of half the population.Elections have consequences. Missourians should remember that next year."
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"With $5 million contract at stake, Missouri issues conflicting medical marijuana rules","May 29, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/with-million-contract-at-stake-missouri-issues-conflicting-medical-marijuana/article_c2968508-fe49-5b36-81d6-81ba98692d73.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — In a decision that could trigger a legal challenge, Gov. Mike Parson’s administration is sending conflicting messages about how the state plans to manage a $5 million medical marijuana contract.Despite a ruling from one state agency that would ban a money-making practice by a medical marijuana contractor, Missouri’s health department has issued a set of rules that would allow companies to charge separate fees to pot dispensaries and growers.The opposing decisions were issued last week, just four days apart and could become the grounds for a lawsuit.

Voters approved Amendment 2 in November, making Missouri the 33rd state to legalize marijuana for medicinal use. Sales are to start early next year. Tax proceeds and licensing fees are supposed to go into a newly created veterans health care fund, which is expected to generate about $20 million per year.In some states, different companies handle the various aspects of operating a medical marijuana program. But Missouri wants one company to do most of the information technology set-up for its licensing and tracking system.In separate decisions issued last week, the state’s Office of Administration said it was denying protests by losing bidders, which argued the state should not have awarded a contract to a competitor in April because it could contain hidden costs.One of the losing companies, BioTrack, suggested Metrc, which won the contract, was able to submit a lower bid to the state because it would charge additional fees to growers and dispensaries.In rejecting the protest, the state said its contract with Metrc does not allow the company to charge additional fees.
But four days later, the Department of Health and Senior Services appeared to ignore that ruling when it issued a set of emergency rules that will govern the roll out of the program.“Unless otherwise addressed or prohibited by contract or law, an entity holding a contract with the state of Missouri for a statewide track and trace system and any affiliates of that entity may charge a price to a licensed or certified facility for plant/product tracking labels,” the rule said.
In response to the new rules, BioTrack attorney Chuck Hatfield is asking the Secretary of State’s office to put a halt to the health department’s decision to issue the rules.“DHSS has introduced substantial uncertainty by issuing an emergency rule that appears to permit Metrc to do exactly what OA said it could not,” Hatfield wrote in a letter to a lawyer for Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft.The Department of Health and Senior Services did not immediately respond to a request for comment.BioTrack and Metrc are among the top operators vying to help states administer their marijuana programs. Metrc has contracts with at least 10 states, while BioTrack has seven.Missouri is required by law to approve at least 60 commercial growers, 86 facilities that manufacture marijuana-infused products and 192 dispensary licenses — 24 dispensaries for each of Missouri’s eight congressional districts.The St. Louis area will probably have more than 48 dispensaries. Two congressional districts cover St. Louis and St. Louis County and parts of St. Charles, Jefferson and Franklin counties.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Governor's Mansion in Missouri in line for long-awaited repairs,"May 29, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/governor-s-mansion-in-missouri-in-line-for-long-awaited/article_ccd424e4-8338-5805-9b79-c46d72a667be.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — Just a year after moving into the governor’s mansion, Republican Mike Parson is poised to depart the capital city landmark.The move, however, is temporary as workers embark on a $3.3 million renovation project that will upgrade the heating and cooling system, fix longstanding plumbing problems and restore interior surfaces.That means new digs for Parson and his wife, Theresa, when they are in town.

Beginning on June 10, they will move into existing housing at the Missouri National Guard compound east of Jefferson City. While the housing unit is perched above the Missouri River like the mansion, it is not within walking distance of the Capitol building.Repairs to the mansion follow a 2016 report that noted the 147-year-old home needs upward of $4.3 million in repairs, including replacement of columns on the home’s sun porch, electrical upgrades, and replacement of the heating and cooling system.The report said all repairs could be made in one year if the governor and his family were to live somewhere else.According to the briefing paper, the interior plaster, paint and flooring of the mansion need to be repaired at an estimated cost of $500,000.“This is a necessary project as the interior plaster on the first floor is flaking and falling,” the document says. “In addition, the existing paint is lead-based and would require a hazardous remediation project. While this work would be occurring, it would be necessary for the family to not be in the residence.”The three-story brick building was first occupied by Gov. Benjamin Gratz Brown in 1872. The first floor includes a 17-foot-high Great Hall, two parlors, a library and a divided dining room. It has 13 bedrooms on the second and third floors.
Parson’s move to a temporary home is similar to what former Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner did in 2015 when the mansion in Springfield was shuttered for $15 million in renovations and upgrades.Rauner and his wife, Diana, lived in a house on the Illinois State Fairgrounds when they were in the capital city.Unlike Illinois, the money paying for the repairs is not from private sources, but from a bond issue the state conducted in 2014. Parson was the sponsor of the legislation.
Some work has already been completed, including the replacement of boilers in the basement.The heating and cooling system will be the biggest undertaking in the project. The mansion has multiple systems installed between 1965 and 2008 that are not integrated between 1965 and 2008.That has left some parts of the building more humid than others, resulting in water damage in some areas of the house, including the first-floor parlor.Pipes that have rusted and clogged and caused damage to walls and floors also will be replaced.Other work includes upgrades to electrical service and fire alarm systems. An exterior fountain also will be repaired.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Planned Parenthood in St. Louis could stop performing abortions as early as this week,"May 29, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/planned-parenthood-in-st-louis-could-stop-performing-abortions-as/article_35b27e68-2139-5aba-8306-3c0aa982291e.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — Planned Parenthood, which operates Missouri's only abortion clinic, said Tuesday it may be forced to cease abortions at the St. Louis facility this week amid a legal fight with the state.Planned Parenthood leaders said the facility's license was in jeopardy after the state sought to ""interrogate"" doctors as part of an annual license renewal process. They said the move was an ""intimidation"" tactic by the Department of Health and Senior Services.DHSS officials did not immediately respond to the accusations. 

However, Dr. Randall Williams, the state department's director, told the Post-Dispatch that the state would make a decision by Friday on whether to renew the facility's license. Before Planned Parenthood officials' comments Tuesday morning, Williams said he could not comment on the pending license renewal application.Since Planned Parenthood and the state have not come to an agreement on staff interviews, the Central West End clinic may have to end abortion services on Friday when its current license expires, Planned Parenthood officials said.""Missouri would be the first state in the country to go dark — without a health center that provides safe, legal abortion care,"" Dr. Leana Wen, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said in a statement.

            Planned Parenthood lawsuit

Jack Suntrup





In a lawsuit filed Tuesday in St. Louis Circuit Court, Planned Parenthood attorneys said the state was ""unlawfully conditioning"" renewal of the facility's license on the completion of an investigation into a patient complaint — the reason for the staff interviews, the lawsuit says.Reproductive Health Services of Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region runs the clinic.On Friday, Gov. Mike Parson signed one of the most restrictive abortion laws in the country.Most of the law's provisions — including one prohibiting most abortions eight weeks into a pregnancy — do not take effect until the end of August.In Metro East, Planned Parenthood operates an abortion clinic in Belleville. Another abortion provider, the Hope Clinic for Women, operates in Granite City.
Dr. Erin King, executive director of the Hope Clinic, said when the Missouri Legislature approved the new law that the clinic would work with patients from conservative states such as Missouri, which could lose access to abortion services.“We will continue to be one option for Missouri patients, as we always have. While the state of Missouri is waging a war against its abortion services and providers, the Hope Clinic remains committed to the patients of Missouri,” she said in a statement on Tuesday. “We will do everything in our power to make sure that further barriers associated with seeking abortion care out of state are lessened to the best of our ability.”Illinois, led by Democrats, has reported more out-of-state abortion patients in recent years as its Republican-led neighbors have further restricted abortions.Meanwhile, the ACLU of Missouri submitted a referendum to the Missouri secretary of state's office on Tuesday in an effort to repeal the abortion law that Parson, a Republican, signed last week.
The ACLU and its allies will have to collect more than 100,000 signatures and turn them into the secretary of state before Aug. 28, when the law is supposed to go into effect.If the group turns in enough signatures, the state will not be allowed to enact the law. At that point, a simple majority of voters could veto the law once it is placed on the ballot in 2020.David Humphreys, a GOP mega-donor who has voiced opposition to the new Missouri law, has said he would finance an effort to overturn the law.""He is not involved with our referendum effort, thus far, at least,"" said Sara Baker, legislative and policy director for the ACLU of Missouri. But, she said, ""we are very open to forming a broad right-left coalition on this.""The method is the same one unions used last year in their successful effort to overturn the state's short-lived right-to-work law.Images of abortion protests since 1973

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,What closing Missouri’s last abortion clinic will mean for neighboring states,"May 29, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/lifestyles/health-med-fit/what-closing-missouri-s-last-abortion-clinic-will-mean-for/article_d42c03fc-d032-560c-ba58-e46f58fe5b00.html,"ST. LOUIS — As the last abortion clinic in Missouri warned that it will have to stop providing the procedure as soon as Friday, abortion providers in surrounding states said they are anticipating an uptick of even more Missouri patients.At Hope Clinic in Granite City, Deputy Director Alison Dreith said Tuesday her clinic was preparing for more patients as news about Missouri spread.“We’re really scrambling today about the need for increased staff and how fast can we hire and train,” Dreith said.

And at a Trust Women clinic in Wichita, Kan., that already has to fly in doctors, the staff didn’t know what it would mean for their overloaded patient schedule.“God forbid we see that people can’t get services in Missouri,” said Julie Burkhart, Trust Women founder and CEO. “What is that going to mean on our limited physician days?”If St. Louis’ Planned Parenthood clinic is unable to offer abortions, the group said, Missouri would be the only state in the country to not have an operating abortion clinic. Five other states — Kentucky, Mississippi, North Dakota, South Dakota and West Virginia — reportedly have only one abortion clinic. And 90% of U.S. counties didn’t have an abortion clinic as of 2014, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive rights research and advocacy group.For some, this echoes back to the days before abortion was legalized nationwide in 1973 with the Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade decision, when patients who could afford to travel would go to more liberal states like California or New York where abortion was legal.But providers in Kansas and Illinois say this influx from Missouri isn’t new. About half of their clients already come from the Show Me State. To the south, in neighboring Arkansas, where a 72-hour waiting period will go into effect in July, the vast majority of its patients still live within the state.Over the past 10 years, four Missouri abortion clinics have closed because of increased regulations, including a mandatory 72-hour waiting period after receiving counseling on abortion, thus requiring two trips to a facility; requirements that physicians have hospital admitting privileges within 15 minutes of their clinics; and a rule requiring two-parent notification for minors and one-parent notarized consent. All those limits left one clinic in downtown St. Louis to serve the whole state.Now Planned Parenthood, which operates that final abortion clinic, said Tuesday it will be forced to end its abortion services altogether by Friday if the state suspends its license. The closure is not related to new anti-abortion laws that Missouri Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican, signed last week to ban most abortions after eight weeks of pregnancy. The new laws don’t take effect until August.
Already the number of patients in Missouri seeking an abortion at the clinic from April 2018 until this April had dropped by 50% compared with the same period the previous year. Planned Parenthood spokesman Jesse Lawder attributes two-thirds of the decrease to the clinic’s refusal to do pelvic exams for abortions performed through medication — recently required by the state — thus forcing all such abortions to be performed out of state.For Dreith, while she expects the Missouri numbers to continue to grow at her Illinois clinic across the Mississippi River, it’s not the only state sending patients her way.
“Patients were literally coming to us from the last remaining clinics in Kentucky … so that they wouldn’t get past 24 weeks,” Dreith said. “We don’t want these patients in surrounding states traveling [to] New York [or] California like they once had to.”That’s how it was prior to the Roe v. Wade ruling, according to Mary Ziegler, a professor at the Florida State University College of Law who is writing her third book on the history of the legal battle around abortion access. She anticipates the pattern of privilege will repeat itself.“You would still expect women with resources to be able to travel as far as they needed,” she said. “And you would expect women without resources to not be able to travel. … The more the court retreats from protecting abortion rights, the more stark those differences will become.”For Dreith, the historical comparison to the pre-Roe era rings true, albeit with improved medical practices.There are safer, easier and more effective ways to perform abortions now than the “horror stories that we saw pre-Roe,” said Dreith. “But I think the travel will be one of the huge throwbacks and the scariest part will be the criminalization.”States such as Missouri could feel pressure to start arresting women who perform their own abortions with pills at home or travel out of state, Ziegler said. But, she said, “punishing women isn’t something that’s thought to be very popular.”Kaiser Health News (KHN) is a national health policy news service.

Steve Roberts, a St. Louis Democrat, said Tuesday he will run for the 5th District seat currently held by Sen. Jamilah Nasheed in the 2020 election.Nasheed, also a Democrat, is term limited and cannot run again.

“The fifth district is the vibrant and exciting center of the region,” said Roberts, who is in his second term as a member of the House. “If elected, I would be honored to represent the district and its diverse population, and will work tirelessly to make sure all its people’s voices are heard.”Roberts is the latest current or former House member to say he’s eyeing a move to the Legislature’s upper chamber.Rep. Doug Beck, D-Affton, is running for the 1st Senate District post held by term-limited Sen. Scott Sifton. Republican Marsha Haefner, who now works for Gov. Mike Parson, also is listed as a potential candidate in that race.Democratic Reps. Tommie Pierson of St. Louis and Alan Green of Florissant are raising money to run in the 13th Senate District currently held by Minority Leader Gina Walsh of Bellefontaine Neighbors. Walsh is term limited.Democrat Mark Osmack has filed paperwork to run against state Sen. Andrew Koenig, R-Manchester in the 15th Senate District, which includes much of west St. Louis County.Osmack made an unsuccessful bid for Congress against Republican Ann Wagner in 2018.Rep. Deb Lavender, D-Kirkwood, told the Post-Dispatch Tuesday that she decided over the weekend to run for the seat, setting up a Democratic primary if both she and Osmack stay in the race.Rep. Chrissy Sommer, R-St. Charles, has filed to run in the St. Charles County district currently held by fellow Republican Sen. Bill Eigel of Weldon Spring.
Prior to winning a seat in the House, Roberts was a prosecutor in the St. Louis circuit attorney’s office.In the House, Roberts has been an advocate for criminal justice reform and economic development.“Social justice and economic development will continue to be a central focus in my campaign and, if I am elected, in my work as a state senator,” Roberts said. “During my time as a prosecutor, I saw firsthand how the system can ensnare those who come into contact with it, especially low-income offenders and people of color.”
The district, a stronghold for Democrats, includes downtown St. Louis and hugs the Mississippi River, stretching from Gimblin Road in the north to the River Des Peres in the south.Roberts' announcement comes a week after he and a fellow lawmaker dropped their lawsuits stemming from an alleged sexual assault.The actions leading to the suits began in September 2016 when Rep. Cora Faith Walker accused Roberts of sexually assaulting her in his apartment in St. Louis.Roberts contended they had consensual sex and sued, accusing Walker of defamation, malicious prosecution and infliction of emotional distress.Walker filed her own civil suit in January 2017. It denied Roberts’ defamation allegation and also accused Roberts of drugging and sexually assaulting her, and claimed that his civil suit was filed to inflict emotional distress.Roberts also is being sued by a woman who alleges he sexually assaulted her at a St. Louis bar in 2015, when she was a law student.Jack Suntrup of the Post-Dispatch contributed to this report.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Trump administration questions why a single judge can block its policies nationwide,"May 26, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/national/trump-administration-questions-why-a-single-judge-can-block-its/article_e0ed8b0b-73ea-5292-b0da-9c3afc871c10.html,"Here are the stories our panel of top political reporters will be watching for in the week ahead, in this week's ""Inside Politics"" forecast.1. Border wall loses another round in courtA federal judge in California is blocking President Donald Trump's plan to use Pentagon funds to build his border wall. New York Times reporter Michael Shear says it's the 38th time a federal court has blocked one of Trump's policies.

Shear said what's particularly galling to the President is that a single district court judge has the power to block his plans everywhere, through a nationwide injunction.""Attorney General Bill Barr complained about it last week, saying that this practice is a violation of Constitutional principles,"" Shear said. ""So the Trump Administration will be going to the Supreme Court to ask the justices to stop this practice. Legal scholars say that's highly unlikely, but there's more than a little bit of irony here -- during eight years of Barack Obama's administration, a favorite tool of Republicans was, you guessed it, going to federal judges asking them to block policies they didn't like.""2. Democrats gear up for election-year fight over abortionMissouri Republican Gov. Mike Parson signed one of the nation's most restrictive abortion laws last week, barring the procedure beyond the eighth week of pregnancy, without exceptions for rape or incest.Missouri joins a growing list of red states seeking to all but ban the vast majority of abortions. Time's Molly Ball says Democrats want to make the future of Roe v. Wade a signature 2020 issue.""Thousands of women and others all over the country came out to protest these laws, and you have all of the 2020 Democratic candidates coming out against them,"" Ball said. ""Even some Republicans say some of these laws go too far. So this is an issue that's going to continue to simmer. You can expect it to still be going on when we get to next year, and you'll hear the candidates talking about this a lot.""3. Saudi weapons sales fightPresident Trump said on Friday he's bypassing Congress to sell more than $8 billion worth of arms to Saudi Arabia -- an announcement that drew condemnation from lawmakers in both parties who want to punish the Saudis for the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi and other human rights abuses.""This is something Congress had been blocking for months, and now they have gone around Congress to complete the sales,"" CNN's Phil Mattingly said, and that's something lawmakers never like.""Saudi Arabia's support on Capitol Hill has really wilted over the course of the last 10 or 11 months, and that is bipartisan,"" Mattingly said. ""You're going to see lawmakers consider a number of ways to try and stop this from happening in the future.""4. Congress & IranAnd that's not the only foreign policy flashpoint on Capitol Hill. Lawmakers are also concerned about the President's plan for Iran -- last week he approved sending an additional 1,500 troops to the region.
""You've seen steps be taken in the last week where the administration finally came down to Capitol Hill to explain the escalation and the movement of a combat strike group and everything else that's been going on in the Persian Gulf,"" Washington Post reporter Karoun Demirjian said.One question, Demirjian said, is whether some lawmakers will push for a new Authorization for the Use of Military Force -- known as an AUMF -- rather than relying on the one passed soon after 9/11 that's been used as the legal justification for military action in the region ever since.5. Recession worries in 2020And from CNN Chief National Correspondent John King:This weekend's presidential trip to Japan is more style than substance. The next one will be far more important -- for the global economy and for Trump's reelection hopes.
The Dow was down last week, and it was the fifth losing week in a row. That hasn't happened since 2011.Trade tensions are the biggest factor, and specifically trade tensions with China.It is easy to find analysts who say the market selloff would be even worse were it not for the anticipation that Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping will strike a deal -- or at least the outlines of an agreement -- when they meet next month at the annual G-20 summit in Osaka.But there are also a growing number of market watchers, or US-China relations experts, who look back at the last week and see steps by both countries that suggest longer-term nationalist instincts are trumping shorter-term economic concerns.Here in the states, the Trump administration's new restrictions on Chinese tech giant Huawei complicate any effort to resolve major trade differences.And those watching President Xi this past week as he traveled and focused on economic issues at home also see a leader digging in for a longer-term showdown.""Huawei is very iconic to the Chinese, kind of like Apple to us, so putting them on the entity list is a real slap in the face and threatens to take the trade war from economics to war over nationalistic pride,"" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. ""It makes it very difficult to stand down.""Trump says standing up to China's unfair trade and other economic policies is long overdue, and he continually voices the belief that the American economy is strong enough to absorb the pain of a trade war.But he also wants that humming economy as his re-election calling card, and a prolonged trade war could put that at risk.Zandi pegs the odds of 2020 recession at 30 percent if nothing changes in the current economic climate. And Zandi says, in his view, the odds of a pre-election recession jump to 50 percent or more if the US-China feud escalates and additional tariffs are added."
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"'Our bodies, our rights:' Hundreds protest Missouri bill banning abortion at 8 weeks","May 25, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/our-bodies-our-rights-hundreds-protest-missouri-bill-banning-abortion/article_5f58c107-53c6-5894-a5cd-d675141b61ab.html,"ST. LOUIS — Hundreds of people gathered Saturday in downtown St. Louis for a student-led protest against a sweeping piece of anti-abortion legislation they say puts lives at risk and is a step back for individual rights.“Our bodies, our rights,” Shri Anantha, 16, with STL Pro-Choice Student Activists, said to a crowd at Poelker Park that included students of all ages, healthcare workers, Missouri Democrats and candidates for state offices.The legislation signed Friday by Gov. Mike Parson bans most abortions at eight weeks of pregnancy, except in medical emergencies. There are no exceptions for rape, incest or human trafficking. The ban takes effect in late August.

“By signing this bill today, we are sending a strong signal to the nation that, in Missouri, we stand for life, protect women’s health, and advocate for the unborn,” Parson said in a statement Friday. “All life has value and is worth protecting.”Some attorneys have said the bill could subject women to felony charges if they perform their own abortions.Protesters Saturday said the ban puts people’s lives at risk by cutting off access to vital healthcare and would disproportionately affect African-Americans and people in poverty.“With this extreme ban on safe and legal abortion, our government is reducing us to our ability to get pregnant, erasing our moral agency, and disregarding our humanity,” said Sarah Felts, spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood. Planned Parenthood runs the only abortion clinic in the state, in the Central West End neighborhood of St. Louis.The bill will not stop abortions from being performed, it will force people to use less-safe methods, said Pamela Merritt, co-founder of the abortion-rights group Reproaction. She called on protesters to support abortion-rights groups and healthcare facilities.“Abortion will exist despite this ban,” she said.The protesters vowed to fight the bill in court and at the ballot box. The League of Women Voters attended the protest to register voters, particularly students who will be of voting age by 2020.“A vote in 2020 is a vote for a woman’s right to life, said state Sen. Jamilah Nasheed, D-St. Louis. “And a woman’s right to life is a woman’s right to choose.”
Trish Gunby, a Democratic candidate to fill a vacancy in Missouri’s 99th District in St. Louis County, said the bill represented a regression that conflicted with the rights established under the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade.“I did not think that 40 years ago, as a teenager, I would have more rights than I do today,” she said.If the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade, “in whole or in part,” the new Missouri legislation states that all abortions would be made illegal except in cases of a medical emergency.
The legislation requires both parents or guardians to be notified before minors can get an abortion, in most cases.Lauryn Donovan, 16, a student at Ladue Horton Watkins High School, said the bill was a form of “institutionalized oppression.”“Don’t force feed your views down somebody’s throat,” Donovan said.The abortion ban doesn’t just affect women, said Louie Westland, 17, a student at Rockwood Summit High School.“This is not a gendered issue,” Westland said. “This is an everybody issue.”Cort VanOstran, a lawyer who narrowly lost the race for Missouri’s 2nd congressional district in November to U.S. Rep. Ann Wagner, R-Mo., said he had a message for men in the crowd.“If we want to live in a country where personal freedoms mean something, we should stand up against laws that take away the rights of half the population,” he said.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Editorial: Will Humphreys lead the charge to take the GOP back from its extremists?,"May 25, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-will-humphreys-lead-the-charge-to-take-the-gop/article_4dd077b3-f15d-5c11-9939-00474b08df21.html,"Conservative mega-donor David Humphreys emerged as an unlikely hero last week in his appeal for Gov. Mike Parson to veto the bill passed by the Legislature on May 17 imposing draconian restrictions on abortion. Parson signed it anyway Friday, setting the scene for a potential battle in the months ahead for the soul of Missouri’s Republican Party.Humphreys made an open appeal for Republicans to err on the side of reason, moderation and compassion, especially for the victims of rape and incest who would be penalized by these new abortion restrictions. Parson, by signing House Bill 126 behind closed doors on Friday, has joined forces with the party’s social-conservative extremists.Humphreys feels so strongly about HB 126’s overreach, he might fund a ballot initiative in 2020 to reverse it, a source close to him told the Post-Dispatch’s Kurt Erickson. “I am personally opposed to HB 126 and believe it was poorly thought out and passed without appropriate public debate,” Humphreys said in a statement. “A bill this restrictive, without the opportunity for exceptions for rape and incest, is bad public policy and bad for Missourians.”

Parson’s decision to sign the bill anyway deepens the party’s ideological split just as campaigns gear up for the 2020 election, in which the governor would be seeking his first full term after succeeding disgraced Gov. Eric Greitens in the job a year ago. He is not a political heavy hitter, and ostracizing someone like Humphreys could prove to be a serious strategic error.
Humphreys rarely takes overt public stands on major social issues, and for him to do so now indicates how strongly he feels about legislative overreach.“I have never entered the public debate over abortion. Nor have I wanted to. Nor do I really want to now,” Humphreys stated. “It is a very difficult subject. And a very personal one with complicated moral issues for all involved. While I am personally opposed to abortion, I do support women’s right to choose particularly in the case of rape or incest. And I have to believe that the politicians in Jeff City that voted for this bill would themselves support their wives or daughters’ right to choose if their loved ones were raped.”
Our issue with Humphreys in the past has been that his generous donations to Republican candidates and causes unduly influences election results, skews democracy and dilutes the power of Missourians’ votes. Politicians, fearful of losing his support, too often blindly support his causes rather than voting their consciences.That he’s conflicted reflects that Humphreys recognizes the nuances of this complicated subject — as should we all — and has determined that extremist solutions are not the answer. Humphreys offers hope that reasonable, moderate Republicans will step forward to take back their party."
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri Gov. Mike Parson signs bill banning abortions at 8 weeks,"May 25, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/missouri-gov-mike-parson-signs-bill-banning-abortions-at-weeks/article_d0cdea5f-89b6-58bd-9221-53e5ee0cb5be.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — Gov. Mike Parson on Friday signed a sweeping piece of anti-abortion legislation that critics and others argue will subject women to felony charges if they perform their own abortions.Parson’s signature comes less than 24 hours after GOP mega donor David Humphreys urged the governor to veto the measure, which bans most abortions at eight weeks of pregnancy. Critics say the legislation — which includes no rape or incest exemptions — is too extreme.The eight-week ban will take effect in late August.

“By signing this bill today, we are sending a strong signal to the nation that, in Missouri, we stand for life, protect women’s health, and advocate for the unborn,” Parson said in a statement. “All life has value and is worth protecting.”Democrats and abortion-rights groups blasted the decision.“Missouri law now requires people to remain pregnant against their will, treating them as little more than fetal incubators with no rights or role in the decision, even in cases of rape and incest,” House Minority Leader Crystal Quade, D-Springfield, said in a statement.“We cannot long claim to be a free society when the heavy hand of government is used to crush individual liberty and subject us to the mandates of official state doctrine,” she said.Instead of holding a public ceremony, Parson signed the legislation in private Friday morning, an unusual move for a governor who has emphasized transparency during his tenure. He did not notify the public that he intended to sign the bill this week.Parson’s secretive predecessor, former Gov. Eric Greitens, also held a private ceremony in 2017 where he signed legislation further regulating abortion in the state.Parson’s spokesman Steele Shippy said Parson had intended to hold public signing events this week in Springfield and Cape Girardeau, but changed his mind after tornadoes and flooding tore up areas of the state.Parson’s signature comes as much of the state’s attention has turned toward natural disaster recovery.Before a tornado swept through Jefferson City Wednesday night, abortion-rights activists had mobilized in an effort to convince Parson, a Republican, to veto the measure.The 2019 legislation bans abortions in the state of Missouri at eight weeks of pregnancy, except in medical emergencies. There are no exceptions for rape, incest or human trafficking.If the Supreme Court overturns Roe vs. Wade, “in whole or in part,” the legislation states that all abortions would be made illegal except in cases of a medical emergency.The legislation also bans a woman from aborting a fetus that might have Down syndrome. It also requires both parents or guardians to be notified before minors can get an abortion, in most cases.
A Jefferson City attorney who analyzed the bill for the Post-Dispatch said it is possible that a woman could be charged with a Class B felony for performing or inducing her own abortion. A Class B felony carries a sentence of between five and 15 years in prison.“My opinion is that there are circumstances in which it is at least possible that a woman could be charged with a felony,” said Lowell Pearson, a Husch Blackwell managing partner who has represented a number of Republican clients, including U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri.The bill says: “Any person who knowingly performs or induces an abortion of an unborn child in violation of this subsection shall be guilty of a class B felony, as well as subject to suspension or revocation of his or her professional license by his or her professional licensing board.”Shippy, Parson’s spokesman, said women inducing or performing their own abortions under the law would not be charged, but he did not elaborate on how the governor’s legal team reached that conclusion.“We are confident in our legal analysis,” Shippy said.
A spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood Advocates in Missouri said the organization’s attorneys were analyzing the legislation and could challenge the new law in court.“We are examining all of our options to ensure Missourians have access to the healthcare that they need,” said Sarah Felts, of Planned Parenthood.Planned Parenthood runs the only abortion clinic in the state, in the Central West End neighborhood of St. Louis.Humphreys said Thursday he would fund an effort to overturn the legislation at the ballot in 2020 if Parson signed it.It is unclear whether putting a question on the ballot would have any significant impact on turnout or on Parson’s ability to win a full term.University of Missouri-St. Louis political scientist Dave Robertson said the same women who are mobilized to oust President Donald Trump also would be mobilized to head to the polls to try to overturn the new abortion law.“It’s a marginal impact,” Robertson said.The legislation is House Bill 126.Kurt Erickson of the Post-Dispatch contributed to this report.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Editorial: Short takes on 'consensual rape' and submarine subterfuge,"May 24, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-short-takes-on-consensual-rape-and-submarine-subterfuge/article_6dfdfed8-f6a0-5966-bc42-1088160ce320.html,"Consensual ignoranceIs there maybe something in the Missouri water? This state is quickly acquiring a national reputation for its bumper crop of men who think they can speak authoritatively about women’s sexuality and reproductive systems but who clearly don’t have a clue.First there was Rep. Todd Akin, who as a Republican U.S. Senate candidate disastrously coined the phrase “legitimate rape” when trying to weirdly explain that women’s bodies have a way of naturally rejecting pregnancy when they’ve been raped. As he explained, the body knows when the rape is legitimate. If pregnancy occurs, his thinking went, then it must not have been rape. The comment handed an easy victory to his Democratic opponent, Sen. Claire McCaskill.

Now comes state Rep. Barry Hovis, another Republican, who used the phrase “consensual rape” as a way of explaining why rape and incest should not be included as exceptions to a bill banning all abortions after eight weeks of pregnancy. That law was passed by the Legislature on May 17 and signed by Gov. Mike Parson on Friday.Hovis, of Jackson, told House members during debate on the closing day of the legislative session that it’s rare for real rape to occur under surprise circumstances involving strangers “jumping out of the bushes.” Such attacks occur maybe “one, two times out of 100,” he said. “Most of them were date rapes or consensual rapes, which were all terrible.”He later apologized, acknowledging that “there is no such thing” as consensual rape. But there is such a thing as consensual ignorance, and Hovis proudly waves its banner.Paying it forwardA billionaire philanthropist has pledged to eliminate the student loan debt of the entire 2019 graduating class of Morehouse College in Atlanta. It’s an astounding show of generosity and an example of social conscience that should occur more commonly among the richest Americans. If it puts a bright spotlight on the nation’s student-loan crisis as well, all the better.Billionaire investor and philanthropist Robert F. Smith announced his plan in a bombshell surprise during his commencement speech at the all-male, historically black college last Sunday. Smith, who is black, is chairman and CEO of Vista Equity Partners, a software and technology investment firm. Wiping out the student debt of the 396 new grads is estimated to cost about $10 million.Smith’s unscripted announcement stunned even the school’s administrators, who’d known nothing about it. Smith encouraged the students to “pay it forward” by helping “ensure we have all the opportunities of the American dream.”New housing for Wellston crook?A federal court should throw the book at Marchell Benton, the former head of the Wellston Housing Authority, for having stolen up to $40,000 of tenants’ rent money and deposited it in her personal bank account. She took the money between 2013 and 2015, when the authority, immersed in mismanagement, incompetence and malfeasance, had been driven into federal receivership.Fast forward to today. Hundreds of low-income Wellston parents and children now face upheaval as their long-neglected housing is threatened with demolition because inadequate funds are available to make the necessary repairs to keep their homes habitable. They could soon have to move — as Benton probably will.
The only difference is that Benton’s new housing should have cold concrete floors and steel doors that slam shut and only open when her prison guards authorize it. Benton has pleaded guilty. Her sentencing is scheduled for August.Semper Fortis?Male sailors aboard a Navy submarine kept a “rape list” and a sexual ranking system regarding female crew members, and invited comments on what types of sex acts the sailors wanted them to perform, according to a recently revealed internal investigation.The 74-page investigation, obtained by Military.comvia a freedom-of-information request, found that female crew members aboard the U.S.S. Florida — only the second Navy submarine to integrate women — were the subject of a list that male crew members kept on the submarine’s computer network. Another list sexually ranked female crew members using a star system.
As disturbing as the harassment itself was, the report’s conclusion is equally troubling: The sub’s commander (who was ultimately relieved of duty) and others in authority failed to adequately address it.In a 2014 scandal, female officers and midshipmen aboard a different submarine were secretly recorded while showering. The military has come a long way on gender issues, but clearly still has a long way to go.Majority rulesNevada in January became the first state in the nation to seat a majority-female legislature. Since then, bills focusing on women’s health and safety have topped the agenda, while sexual harassment within the legislature has been addressed head-on.In part in response to President Donald Trump’s election, Nevada voters in November elected 23 women of both parties to the Assembly and 10 to the Senate, giving women a combined total of 52 percent of seats.That gender power shift has dramatically impacted the focus of legislation. Almost 20 bills have been filed dealing with sexual assault, sex trafficking and sexual misconduct, with others addressing subjects like banning child marriage and examining the causes of maternal mortality.“There’s change in this building that is just this amazing story of transformation,” Nevada Assemblywoman Heidi Swank told The Washington Post. “And it really highlights the importance of the female majority being not just here, but finally being heard.”Compare that to, say, Alabama — where a dismal 15 percent of the Legislature is female, and which just passed what is arguably the most draconian abortion ban in America. That said, the state’s female governor signed it into law."
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,More than 70 buildings destroyed by tornado in Missouri capital,"May 24, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/more-than-buildings-destroyed-by-tornado-in-missouri-capital/article_d3e1843d-efb2-5c09-84aa-6dcc6263ac97.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — A preliminary review of tornado damage in Missouri’s capital city shows 78 buildings were destroyed in Wednesday’s overnight storm.According to information collected by a team of emergency personnel workers Thursday, the buildings include parts of a large apartment complex on the city’s south side, as well as structures near downtown that were more than a century old.Stacey Young, who operates an appraisal business out of a historic brick building on Capitol Avenue, was hurrying Friday to move records and other articles out of the two-story structure before the hot, sunny weather turned stormy again.

She said the level of destruction east of the unscathed Capitol building was heartbreaking to the property owners who are trying to transform the area.“We’ve all been working very, very diligently trying to get these buildings back in shape,” Young said. “We are all extremely grateful there were no lives lost, but we are wondering what’s going to happen to a lot of these structures.”Young said she had just spent $60,000 to upgrade an apartment on the second story of the building that now features a collapsed exterior wall.“I hope to get a structural engineer in there to find out whether the building can be saved,” Young said.Residents and workers worked Friday to dig out from the tornado that injured an estimated 25 people as it cut a swath across the mid-Missouri town of 40,000 residents. No fatalities were reported in Jefferson City, but three died near Golden City in Barton County.
var pymParent = pym.Parent('pym-content-2', '//graphics.stltoday.com/apps/maps/tornadoes/2019-05-22/jefferson-city/', {});The storm that hit Jefferson City was rated as an EF-3 with estimated peak winds of 160 miles per hour, the National Weather Service said.Along with the structures that were listed as destroyed, an additional 15 were listed as “failed” because of concerns that they could suddenly collapse.
The map shows hundreds of other homes, businesses and government buildings with moderate damage across the mid-section of the community.Gov. Mike Parson said the assessment was done by a team of volunteer engineers, architects, building inspectors, and other trained professionals as part of the Missouri Structural Assessment and Visual Evaluation program.On Saturday, the team is expected to evaluate about 200 additional structures in Cole County that are reported to have been damaged.
The American Red Cross was operating two shelters Friday — one at a Jefferson City middle school and another in Eldon, south of Jefferson City.On Thursday night, the shelter population totaled 33 people.In a press release, the Red Cross urged people to donate cash rather than household items such as clothes, food or furniture.“The shelters in Jefferson City and Eldon have received numerous donations such as clothing and toiletries and are requesting the public to hold off on any additional items at this time. The Red Cross is working with community partners to determine a specific location that is able to take additional items for individuals affected by the tornado and the information will be provided as it becomes available,” the organization said.As of Friday morning, Ameren Missouri and Three Rivers Electric Cooperative reported nearly 4,000 outages, down from 14,000 on Thursday.Although frontline workers like prison guards and law enforcement workers were still on duty, the majority of the more than 14,000 state government workers who descend on the office buildings in the city were off on Friday. In addition to ongoing cleanup and recovery efforts, employee parking lots near some state office buildings were underwater as the Missouri River topped its flood stage.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Conservative donor drops abortion bombshell, urging Parson to veto Missouri limits","May 24, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/conservative-donor-drops-abortion-bombshell-urging-parson-to-veto-missouri/article_f78ad070-3bc8-5287-9ee3-f449af754cfc.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — A wealthy conservative donor to Republican causes is urging Gov. Mike Parson to veto a restrictive abortion law approved by Missouri lawmakers last week.In a statement obtained by the Post-Dispatch, Joplin-based roofing magnate David Humphreys said a lack of exceptions in House Bill 126 allowing for abortion in cases of rape and incest of the mother “is bad public policy and bad for Missourians.”“I am personally opposed to HB 126 and believe it was poorly thought out and passed without appropriate public debate,” Humphreys wrote. “I have never entered the public debate over abortion. Nor have I wanted to. Nor do I really want to now.”

The email puts Parson, a Republican, in a tight political spot as he considers whether to sign the measure, which was designed to trigger a court challenge that could overturn the U.S. Supreme Court’s landmark Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized abortion.If Parson signs the legislation, a source close to Humphreys said the mega-donor would bankroll a ballot initiative in 2020 seeking to undo the changes. A spirited debate over abortion could play a pivotal role in Parson’s bid for a full term as chief executive.Parson’s office, which was monitoring and assessing tornado damage in the capital city on Thursday, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Humphreys, whose Tamko Building Products makes roofing shingles, has funneled millions of dollars toward GOP causes in recent years, including to the election of U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley and to the House Republican fundraising arm.During the 2016 election cycle, Humphreys and his family contributed more than $14 million to Republicans.Legislation sponsored the following year by former state Senate President Pro Tem Ron Richard, also of Joplin, would have limited a plaintiff’s ability to sue individually or in class-action lawsuits under the Missouri Merchandising Practices Act, a law that prohibits deceptive and unfair business practices.The proposed change came as Tamko was facing a class-action lawsuit under the act alleging it sold defective shingles. The company has denied the charges.Parson told reporters last week that he planned to sign the measure, which bans abortions at eight weeks of pregnancy, except when the life of the mother is threatened. There are no exceptions for rape, incest or human trafficking.The legislation also bans a woman from aborting a fetus that might have Down syndrome. It requires both parents or guardians to be notified before minors can get an abortion, in most cases.
The measure says anyone “who knowingly performs or induces an abortion” in cases that are not exempted by the legislation would be guilty of a Class B felony, which carries a minimum five-year prison sentence.If the Supreme Court overturns Roe vs. Wade, “in whole or in part,” the legislation states that all abortions would be made illegal except in cases of a medical emergency.Humphreys called abortion “a very difficult subject. And a very personal one with complicated moral issues for all involved.”“While I am personally opposed to abortion, I do support a women’s right to choose, particularly in the case of rape or incest. And I have to believe that the politicians in Jeff City that voted for this bill would themselves support their wives or daughters’ right to choose if their loved ones were raped,” he said.
“I hope that Governor Parson will consider the bill’s harmful impact on women and veto this legislation,” Humphreys added.Missouri already has some of the toughest abortion regulations in the country. There is one clinic in the state, in the Central West End neighborhood of St. Louis, but clinics also operate in Metro East — in Granite City and Fairview Heights. Planned Parenthood operates a clinic in Kansas, near Kansas City, Mo.In 2017, lawmakers approved, and then-Gov. Eric Greitens signed into law, a round of abortion regulations that proponents said would protect the health and safety of women.It requires that doctors explain the risks of abortion to women 72 hours before an abortion is performed. The law added annual inspections of clinics and new whistleblower protections for employees of clinics, and boosted requirements for pathologists who provide services to abortion facilities.Another Republican mega-donor, retired St. Louis financier Rex Sinquefield, is apparently not entering the debate over the abortion bill.A spokesman for Sinquefield said Thursday he had “no position” on the legislation.Jack Suntrup of the Post-Dispatch contributed to this report.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Tornado kills 3 in southwestern Missouri on anniversary of deadly Joplin twister,"May 24, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/state-and-regional/tornado-kills-in-southwestern-missouri-on-anniversary-of-deadly-joplin/article_b65db840-b6d7-539e-a28c-4b43a4ef49d9.html,"JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. — Theresa Stephens hunkered down in her pitch black apartment, listening to the violent tornado that was coming.""I didn't realize it was that close,"" she said. ""You could hear it coming. It was like, 'whoosh.""On Thursday, wrapped in a blanket at a shelter the morning after an EF-3 tornado blew overthrough Jefferson City, Stephens said she thought her apartment was undamaged, but said some of her neighbors weren't as lucky. When the storm passed, officials told Stephens and her neighbors to evacuate, and she left her five parakeets behind at the Hawthorne Park Apartments. 

""I hope they're OK,"" said Stephens, 59, sitting alone at a cafeteria table in Thomas Jefferson Middle School — one of countless people whose lives were interrupted by the twister Wednesday night. The tornado caused heavy damage in Missouri's capital city as severe weather swept across the state overnight, causing three deaths in southwest Missouri and leaving many people trapped in the wreckage of their homes.The National Weather Service confirmed the twister that moved over Jefferson City shortly before midnight Wednesday, moving northeast at 40 mph. The capital city has a population of about 40,000 and is located about 130 miles west of St. Louis.""Across the state, Missouri's first responders once again responded quickly and with strong coordination as much of the state dealt with extremely dangerous conditions that left people injured, trapped in homes, and tragically led to the death of three people,"" Gov. Mike Parson said Thursday morning, as the extent of damage was becoming clear.The three dead were on the outskirts of a town called Golden City, in Barton County, Mo., about 50 miles west of Springfield. Sgt. John Lueckenhoff of the Missouri Highway Patrol identified the victims as Kenneth Harris, 86; his wife, Opal Harris, 83; and Betty Berg, 56.Kenneth and Opal Harris lived in a frame home on 80th Lane near Golden City. ""They were found about 200 yards from where their residence once stood,"" Lueckenhoff told the Post-Dispatch.
var pymParent = pym.Parent('pym-content-1', '//graphics.stltoday.com/apps/maps/tornadoes/2019-05-22/golden-city/', {});Berg lived nearby, in a mobile home on Highway 126. Her husband, Mark Berg, 56, survived. The Bergs were found among debris from the mobile home, Lueckenhoff said.National Weather Service meteorologist Cory Rothstein said it's possible the tornado had a 50-mile path and could have been on the ground for 80 minutes. Teams were surveying the path Thursday and trying to determine whether one or multiple tornadoes had touched down.The National Weather Service office in Springfield issued its tornado warning there at 8:34 p.m., and based on radar, put the arrival time of the tornado around 9:08 p.m. Several other people were injured in the Carl Junction area of Jasper County. A 'chaotic' situationThe Jefferson City tornado cut a path about 3 miles long and a mile wide from the south end of Jefferson City north toward the Missouri River around 11:40 p.m. Wednesday, said police Lt. David Williams.
var pymParent = pym.Parent('pym-content-2', '//graphics.stltoday.com/apps/maps/tornadoes/2019-05-22/jefferson-city/', {});Emergency workers reported about two dozen injuries, Williams said, and dozens of people were in shelters. Hospitals reported treating injuries such as cuts and bruises. There were no immediate reports of any deaths or missing people in the capital city.Williams said authorities received multiple calls of people being trapped in homes and described the situation overnight as ""chaotic."" The National Weather Service sent survey teams to Golden City and Jefferson City areas to inspect the damage.Doug Tilly, meteorologist with the National Weather Service office in Weldon Spring, said the Jefferson City tornado appears to have covered at least 30 miles — from Eldon, Mo., on the south to north of Jefferson City.""As far as we can tell, it was on the ground the entire time,"" Tilly said.Thousands of power outages were reported, according to an outage map from Ameren.'It's a sad day'The tornado ripped a swath through the eastern edge of downtown Jefferson City, avoiding much of the main shopping district. But, on Marshall Street, Kent George bemoaned the damage to his 29-unit apartment building.
""I just put a new roof on it,"" George said.He was relieved none of his tenants were hurt.At the corner of Marshall and Capitol, where historic homes were being primed for redevelopment, trees and roofing material littered the streets. Utility crews cordoned off intersections where electric wires lay after poles snapped in the wind.The tornado did not damage the Missouri Capitol Building or the Governor's Mansion, but it did significant damage to the state Employment Security Building, located in the line of the storm. The facility's roof and air conditioning units will need to be replaced. Power at the building could be out for several days, said the governor's Office of Administration.The Missouri Career Center also received extensive damage. Other buildings that sustained minor roof damage include the Lewis and Clark State Office Building, the state public health lab and the Missouri Lottery headquarters.
While state Rep. Rudy Veit, an attorney from Jefferson City, surveyed the damage to his law offices on High Street, he also was thankful no one was injured when the glass-sheathed structure was hit.""We've already had offers of places to move while we rebuild,"" Veit said. ""Hopefully we can get the electricity back on and get back on track.""After 40 years in the communications business, Steve Veile was poised to head into retirement this year. Now he's not sure what his next step will be.
Veile’s building, like others, was built long ago by inmates at the shuttered Missouri State Penitentiary just down the street. He moved in and restored what had once been a family home with horse stables in the basement.It’s been home to his Communique Communications for 36 years. The company does strategic communications for businesses and organizations.“It’s a sad day,” Veile said.Gary and Lynette Jackson, of the 400 block of Marshall Street near downtown, were assessing the damage around noon to their one-story home. The wall to their sun room had blown off, and several windows on their cars and home were busted.""I'm still really nervous,"" said Lynette Jackson, 52, who works for the state.She worried about the structural integrity of the home where the couple had lived for 15 years, and whether damaged trees would fall and cause more damage.Birthday cake supplies and an old state manual were scattered around the home.""Everything inside is just turned around,"" Lynette Jackson said. ""The windows are busted out.""Anniversary of deadly Joplin tornado














        
            It seems like Tornado Alley is shifting - and Missouri and Illinois are seeing more

In the traditional alley states of Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas, tornado activity has dropped a little - but it's gotten higher here. And scient…




The string of storms included a tornado near Carl Junction that skirted just a few miles north of Joplin, Mo., on the eighth anniversary of a catastrophic tornado that killed 161 people in the city.Storms and torrential rains have ravaged the Midwest, from Texas through Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, Iowa, Missouri and Illinois.The Arkansas River was approaching historic highs, while the already high Missouri and Mississippi Rivers were again rising after a multiday stretch of storms that produced dozens of tornadoes. Forecasters predicted parts of Oklahoma, Missouri and Kansas could see more severe weather on Thursday.Deaths from this week's storms include a 74-year-old woman found early Wednesday morning in Iowa. Missouri authorities said heavy rain was a contributing factor in the deaths of two people in a traffic accident Tuesday near Springfield.Another weather-related death may have occurred in Oklahoma, where the Highway Patrol said a woman apparently drowned after driving around a barricade Tuesday near Perkins, about 45 miles northeast of Oklahoma City.The Associated Press and Kim Bell of the Post-Dispatch staff contributed to this report.

        Missouri Public Safety tweeted that there was a possibility of more tornadoes and flash flooding.Austin Thomson, 25, was in the laundry room of his apartment complex to do his wash and noticed the wind started picking up. He saw sheets of rain coming down and a flagpole bend and then slam to the ground. The windows broke and he dove behind the washers and dryers.
After it calmed down, he walked outside to check the damage.""There's basically one building that's basically one story now. Every building there is two stories.""The National Weather Service said it had received 22 reports of tornadoes by late Wednesday, although some of those could be duplicate reporting of the same twister.One tornado skirted just a few miles north of Joplin, Missouri, on the eighth anniversary of a catastrophic tornado that killed 161 people in the city. The tornado caused some damage in the town of Carl Junction, about 4 miles (6.44 kilometers) north of the Joplin airport.Storms and torrential rains have ravaged the Midwest, from Texas through Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, Iowa, Missouri and Illinois.
Two barges broke loose and floated swiftly down the swollen Arkansas River in eastern Oklahoma on Wednesday, spreading alarm downstream as they threatened to hit a dam.Authorities urged residents of several small towns in Oklahoma and Kansas to leave their homes as rivers and streams rose.The Arkansas River town of Webbers Falls, Oklahoma, was one such town. Town officials ordered a mandatory evacuation Wednesday afternoon because of the river's rising level.But Wednesday evening, a posting on the town's official Facebook page sounded the alarm about the runaway barges for its 600 residents: ""Evacuate Webbers Falls immediately. The barges are loose and has the potential to hit the lock and dam 16. If the dam breaks, it will be catastrophic!! Leave now!!""There was no word by midnight Wednesday where the barges were on the river, but local television stations showing live video of the river and the lock and dam said they had not yet arrived.The Arkansas River was approaching historic highs, while the already high Missouri and Mississippi Rivers were again rising after a multi-day stretch of storms that produced dozens of tornadoes. Forecasters predicted parts of Oklahoma, Missouri and Kansas could see more severe weather on Thursday.Deaths from this week's storms include a 74-year-old woman found early Wednesday morning in Iowa. Officials there say she was killed by a possible tornado that damaged a farmstead in Adair County. Missouri authorities said heavy rain was a contributing factor in the deaths of two people in a traffic accident Tuesday near Springfield.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Will Missouri women face felonies for performing abortions on themselves? Lawyers disagree.,"May 23, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/will-missouri-women-face-felonies-for-performing-abortions-on-themselves/article_0dd4868f-2a96-5445-a1ed-f6dfe19b4b5f.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — Democrats opposed to a Missouri proposal outlawing most abortions say women who perform one on themselves could soon be subject to felony charges. Republican sponsors say this would never happen.But detractors of the bill — which bans abortions at eight weeks of pregnancy — have laid out several scenarios in which they believe prosecutors may be able to charge a woman who undergoes an abortion.A scorned lover could accuse a woman who had a miscarriage of actually having an abortion, in violation of the law, they say. The woman could take a drug to induce an abortion, in violation of the law, they say.

Proponents say the hypothetical scenarios are scare tactics meant to sow doubt in one of the nation’s toughest anti-abortion proposals, which awaits Gov. Mike Parson’s signature.A Jefferson City attorney who analyzed the bill for the Post-Dispatch said it is possible that a woman could be charged with a Class B felony for performing or inducing her own abortion. A Class B felony carries a sentence of between five and 15 years in prison.“My opinion is that there are circumstances in which it is at least possible that a woman could be charged with a felony,” said Lowell Pearson, a Husch Blackwell managing partner who has represented a number of Republican clients, including U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri.Pearson also served as general counsel in the office of former Gov. Matt Blunt, a Republican. Pearson said he was not involved in the drafting of the bill and had not analyzed it before a reporter called him on Wednesday.If Parson, a Republican, signs the measure as expected, the provision in question would take effect in August. A spokesman for the governor said in an email, “It is our understanding that HB 126 does not provide for any criminal penalties against a woman receiving an abortion.”Democratic prosecutors in Kansas City and St. Louis are also grappling with the language — and considering whether women could be charged.The measure bans abortions at the eighth week of a woman’s pregnancy, except in medical emergencies.The bill says: “Any person who knowingly performs or induces an abortion of an unborn child in violation of this subsection shall be guilty of a class B felony, as well as subject to suspension or revocation of his or her professional license by his or her professional licensing board.”“It seems to me — if a woman takes some sort of drug or does some other activity to herself, she would be potentially within that provision,” Pearson said.“I think it’s a pretty big reach to try to read that in a way that says the woman would be liable,” said Rep. Mary Elizabeth Coleman, R-Arnold, who is a lawyer and who helped draft the bill.“When you read the language, it’s clear that there’s no penalties except for those who cause an abortion to be induced or performed,” she said, referring to the doctors or nurse practitioners who perform the procedure.The bill goes on to say that a “woman upon whom an abortion is performed or induced in violation of this subsection shall not be prosecuted for a conspiracy to violate the provisions of this subsection.”“To be abundantly clear, there’s another sentence immediately following that says a woman shall not be charged with conspiracy,” Coleman said.But an exemption for conspiracy charges would not cover a woman who completes an abortion herself, detractors argue.“If I live in Sikeston (Missouri) and I go to Illinois, get my pills, and then take my pills in Missouri, I think I could be prosecuted under this — not for conspiracy but for inducing an abortion,” said Rep. Gina Mitten, D-Richmond Heights, who is an attorney.“My reading of the statute is that it’s only a physician that performs or induces the procedure that could be prosecuted,” said St. Charles County Prosecutor Timothy Lohmar, a Republican.“I guess it could be boiled down to an interpretation of what does the word ‘induce’ mean,” he said. “Can a woman induce her own abortion? I don’t know. From my reading, I don’t think that was the intent, from the language that was drafted.
“If I were to get a warrant application for a woman who is accused of inducing her own abortion, I don’t think that under the version of the statute that I could prosecute that,” he said.When asked whether they would enforce the pending abortion law, and whether prosecutors believed women could be charged, St. Louis-area Democratic prosecutors sent statements that did not answer either question.“We are currently examining the ramifications of the passage of recent abortion legislation on health care professionals who provide women health services in the city of St. Louis,” said Susan Ryan, a spokeswoman for St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kimberly M. Gardner.St. Louis County Prosecutor Wesley Bell said in a statement, “Roe v. Wade is the law of the land and has been settled law since 1973. It is infuriating that this fundamental constitutional principal — and the humanity of women — is being put into play for political purposes.”The state’s only abortion clinic is located in the Central West End, which is under Gardner’s jurisdiction.Rep. Ian Mackey, D-Richmond Heights, said a woman who had a miscarriage could be accused of having an abortion in violation of the law.
“I think that’s completely plausible,” said Mackey, an attorney.It would be less plausible that she would be charged in St. Louis, Mackey said.But, he said, in conservative counties around the state: “I think that there are prosecutors who would prosecute that. I think there are husbands and ex-boyfriends and abusive paramours who would allege that.”If the U.S. Supreme Court strikes down Roe v. Wade, Missouri’s abortion laws would become even tougher, outlawing all abortions except in cases of medical emergency.Samuel Lee, an anti-abortion lobbyist who helped guide the measure to the governor’s desk, said Democrats and others are trying to confuse the public and dissuade Parson from signing the bill.In recent days, abortion rights advocates have lit up Parson’s office with phone calls, and they have held protests around the state urging him to veto the bill. St. Louis County Executive Sam Page, in a meeting with the governor this week, urged Parson to veto the bill. But Parson has said he will sign it.“It’s simply not true,” Lee said of whether women who undergo an abortion could be charged. “These are just detractors who are trying to find any way to undercut either the governor signing the bill, or confusing the public for whatever reason.“The implication in the law is that it is someone performing or inducing an abortion upon someone else,” he said of who would be charged.When told that there did not appear to be an explicit prohibition against charging women undergoing an abortion, Lee said: “I am absolutely, 100 percent confident that no woman would ever be charged under this bill.”The legislation is House Bill 126.(tncms-asset)fdaf5220-7a75-11e9-8d5a-00163ec2aa77[0](/tncms-asset)

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Another round of strong storms expected Wednesday night, but risk to St. Louis area will be lower","May 22, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/another-round-of-strong-storms-expected-wednesday-night-but-risk/article_131fbb80-c838-5805-afcc-a8305e2b24bf.html,"Strong storms roared across the St. Louis area Tuesday night, toppling trees and drenching everything but causing no major damage.Tornado sirens sounded in waves across the region, but by about 10 p.m. the only big weather left was rain.The storms are part of a weather system moving across the Midwest that began last weekend and will continue through the week, according to the National Weather Service. After Tuesday's storms, the St. Louis area is expected to see scattered showers through the weekend, causing the Mississippi River near St. Louis to rise further. 

The St. Louis area could see more thunderstorms on Wednesday, but the risk is higher to the west and north. A National Weather Service map shows the St. Louis area at slight to marginal risk. The storms are capable of producing large hail, wind damage and thunderstorms, with the highest risk in a swath of western Missouri.
Attention & Retweet: Severe thunderstorms EXPECTED this evening. Portions of #mowx upgraded to MODERATE RISK. #ilwx #stlwx pic.twitter.com/fEXOl66PVK— NWS St. Louis (@NWSStLouis) May 22, 2019
 Meanwhile, the National Weather Service said a tornado that touched down during Tuesday night's storm had been confirmed and was rated as an EF-1, with maximum sustained winds around 100 mph. There was also a EF-1 tornado further west in Yucatan, Mo., about 45 minutes earlier.
While we weren't able to survey all the areas that may have had tornadoes last night, we did find tornadoes near Yucatan and Augusta MO. Both tornadoes were rated at an EF-1 with maximum estimated winds around 100 mph. Thankfully no one was hurt #mowx pic.twitter.com/kfzqS56fyS— NWS St. Louis (@NWSStLouis) May 22, 2019
 Augusta Fire Protection District Assistant Chief Paul Hopen said multiple trees fell across roadways, causing some structural damage around the city.There were no other tornado touchdowns confirmed by radar in the metro area, Doug Tilly, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service, said on Wednesday morning.Gov. Mike Parson declared a state of emergency as the state braced for severe weather through Wednesday that is expected to worsen flooding. Flash floods had occurred in several counties in southwest Missouri by Tuesday, sending four people to the hospital and requiring emergency response to rescue other people, according to the governor's office. The state of emergency prompts state agencies to coordinate with local authorities to monitor river levels and fight flooding. Tuesday's fast-moving storm arrived in the metro area about the time that thousands of people were gathering downtown for the St. Louis Blues game. The St. Louis Cardinals game was postponed because of the inclement weather and rescheduled as an interleague, day-night doubleheader Wednesday.

 The area’s flooding woes are not over, according to the weather service. Heavy rainfall could cause flooding in areas along the Mississippi River, including in the St. Louis area. Scattered showers are expected through the rest of the week. 
A flood warning issued Monday morning will continue until further notice, officials said. The National Weather Service advises people in the St. Louis area to never drive cars or other vehicles through flooded areas, as the water could be too deep to safely pass through.The Mississippi River has been above flood level of 30 feet for weeks, reaching 41.7 feet on May 6, said Patrick Walsh, with the National Weather Service in St. Louis. That's the seventh highest crest in the records. The river had since receded to about 35 feet by Tuesday, but was expected to rise back to 41 feet or higher by Memorial Day, Walsh said.Authorities in Lincoln County urged evacuation of an area east of Highway 79 from Foley south to the southern section of the Winfield Main Levee. The river is expected to peak at 34.9 feet in the area of Winfield, where a 300-foot wide breach in the Winfield Main Levee remains from flooding earlier this month.""If you live or work in these areas, you are urged in the strongest possible terms to evacuate,"" Lincoln County Emergency Management said in an alert. ""The breach in the levee means you will experience the rise of the Mississippi River as it happens, with little or no lag time.""
Aubuchon Road in the Hazelwood area was closed due to the possibility of a levee breach in the area that could endanger motorists.On Monday evening, Gov. Mike Parson announced that President Donald Trump had granted a request for a disaster declaration for 13 Missouri counties that were impacted by storm and flooding damage from March 11 to April 16. The affected counties are Andrew, Atchison, Buchanan, Carroll, Chariton, Holt, Mississippi, New Madrid, Pemiscot, Perry, Platte, Ray and Ste. Genevieve.The declaration grants millions of dollars in federal assistance to these counties to assist with bridge and road repair, as well as making up some of the cost of emergency response during the storms and flooding. It also makes assistance available from the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s Hazard Mitigation Program, which is designed to reduce long-term risk to people and property due to natural hazards, according to a statement from the governor’s office.David Carson and Kim Bell of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch contributed to this report.• St. Louis weather truisms• Find the latest forecast• Flooding forecast: How high will floodwaters rise? • Check local traffic conditions• Road conditions and closures from MoDOT

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Editorial: Parson should leave Missouri's motorcycle helmet law firmly strapped in place.,"May 22, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-parson-should-leave-missouri-s-motorcycle-helmet-law-firmly/article_fe36004d-10f9-51b0-99b9-643517d5688b.html,"If Gov. Mike Parson signs a bill to remove Missouri’s motorcycle helmet requirement, it will cost lives. That’s virtually undebatable. Missouri currently requires all riders and passengers on motorcycles to wear helmets. The Legislature passed a bill this session to make the rule apply only to riders under age 18, allowing adults to ride with the wind in their hair — and, in some cases, inevitably, their brains on the asphalt.While America has steadily moved toward near-universal seat belt laws for years, trends in motorcycle helmet laws have been all over the road. Helmets-for-all laws like Missouri’s are currently in force in 19 states. Almost 30 others require them only for minors, leaving the vast majority of riders unprotected.With states variously loosening and tightening their helmet laws over the years, it’s possible to track trends in helmet effectiveness that essentially confirm common sense. As the Post-Dispatch’s Kurt Erickson reported Wednesday, Texas alone has been a case study in the difference helmets make.

The Lone Star State saw a 35 percent jump in motorcycle fatalities after it did what Missouri is contemplating. In 1977, the state changed its universal-helmet law to cover only minors. When Texas reinstated its universal helmet law in 1989, deaths dropped by 11 percent. When it again changed the law in 1997 to cover only riders younger than 21, deaths again jumped, by 31 percent.Helmet-law opponents argue numbers like that merely reflect fewer riders riding where there are helmet laws, and that helmets can cause accidents by impeding riders’ vision. Neither claim has much validity, studies have found.
But the primary argument made against helmet laws isn’t about data, anyway. It’s about the philosophical premise that people have the right to increase their risk of death if they want to. As one Missouri anti-helmet lobbyist told the Post-Dispatch: “It’s about freedom.”
However, the implication that going helmetless affects only the rider is a myth. A study by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on the societal costs of motorcycle accidents — costs like immediate and long-term medical expenses that often get passed onto the taxpayers, lost productivity for the economy and higher insurance rates for everyone — are demonstrably higher in motorcycle accidents with unhelmeted riders.The reason is simple: With unhelmeted riders, head trauma is more often part of the equation. “For victims of serious head injury,” the report says, “acute hospital care might be only the first stage of a long and costly treatment program. For many crash victims, lost wages from missed work days will outweigh medical costs.”As Parson decides what to do with this legislation, he should imagine how he would come down on a bill seeking to give Missourians a specific legal right to publicly engage in games of Russian roulette. Because that’s effectively what this bill does."
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Abortion bills are regressive and unconstitutional,"May 22, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/mailbag/abortion-bills-are-regressive-and-unconstitutional/article_8e7bcbd1-3ba9-5e2a-a5de-aba47eb9cc64.html,"The bills passed in Georgia, Alabama and Missouri are anathema to the majority of Americans. These bills seek not to protect lives, but to subjugate women by criminalizing our health care decisions. These draconian laws are in direct violation of our basic human and constitutional rights.Whether to terminate a pregnancy or not is a personal, private decision into which no government has the right to interfere. In the United States, every woman has the unalienable right to her own life, liberty and the pursuit of her own happiness.

These regressive measures are also racist and classist, denying poor women and women of color the freedoms that wealthy white women will continue to exercise.
They will have a disastrous impact on our economy and result in the deaths of many women.
I demand that Gov. Mike Parson vetoes these misogynist attacks on women’s rights.Kathleen Corbett-Otto • Overland"
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Across US, and in St. Louis, activists protest new wave of abortion bans","May 21, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/across-us-and-in-st-louis-activists-protest-new-wave/article_9adcbf86-4564-5908-b7c3-5c219a131a7d.html,"At the U.S. Supreme Court, statehouses and other sites across the nation, abortion rights supporters held rallies Tuesday in opposition to the wave of sweeping abortion bans being enacted this year in Midwestern and Southern states.Organizers — including Planned Parenthood, NARAL Pro-Choice America and the American Civil Liberties Union — predicted tens of thousands of people would attend hundreds of events scheduled in all 50 states.The ""National Day of Action to Stop the Bans"" came in response a near-total ban on abortion recently signed into law in Alabama, as well as bills enacted or nearing passage in Mississippi, Kentucky, Ohio, Georgia and Louisiana aimed at banning abortion once a fetal heartbeat is detected. That can happen in the sixth week of pregnancy, before many women know they're pregnant. Missouri lawmakers have passed an eight-week ban.

None of the laws has taken effect, and all will likely be blocked while legal challenges play out. Ban supporters hope one or more of the measures might reach the Supreme Court and possibly trigger reversal of the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion nationwide.In St. Louis, a crowd stretched from the west side of Luther Ely Smith Park, in the shadow of the Arch, across Fourth Street to the steps of the Old Courthouse.Their cheers, and boos for politicians who passed the ban, were joined by the honks and raised thumbs of passing drivers.Signs warned that ""Signers of HB126 will pay at the polls"" and said ""Women will die. Republicans don't care.""Speakers, including The Rev. Traci Blackmon; St. Louis Treasurer Tishaura Jones; Rep. Cora Faith Walker, D-Ferguson; two OBGYNs and Alison Dreith, deputy director of Hope Clinic for Women; told the crowd that the bill would was about controlling women and would not stop abortions, but simply prevent safe access to them.They passed out Gov. Mike Parson's phone number and implored the crowd to ""flood"" his office with calls and vote those who supported the ban out of office.At the end of the organized event, some protesters filled Fourth Street, blocking traffic and chanting ""veto"" and ""we won't go back"" for about 20 minutes before leaving.In Washington, a demonstration outside the Supreme Court drew hundreds of protesters and several Democratic presidential candidates. Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, in addition to Reps. Eric Swalwell of California and Tim Ryan of Ohio, were among the attendees as multiple members of Congress spoke to a crowd that hoisted signs defending abortion rights.""I cannot tell you how important this moment in our country's history is,"" Gillibrand said. ""Do not allow this moment to lapse without putting everything you can behind it. Organize, advocate and vote.""Some protesters carried purple signs that declared, ""Abortion is a human right."" Among their chants: ""No church/No state/Women must decide their fate.""Lauri Ploch, 67, came from Alexandria, Virginia, with a sign depicting a drawing of a uterus and the message, ""Mine, not yours.""Ploch recalled the conflict over birth control and abortion rights in her youth, and suggested that her generation mistakenly believed that such struggles were in the past.""I got complacent for a little while. I think a lot of people did,"" she said. ""Right now we need to really get up in their faces and show that we are ready to fight to keep our rights.""
In Atlanta, several hundred protesters jammed onto the steps of the Georgia statehouse.Chants of ""Vote them out!"" and ""My body, my right!"" blared through a loudspeaker as passing drivers honked their horns in support. One woman carried a coat hanger with a sign that read, ""Not going back.""Brandi Borgwat, 42, drove about 30 minutes from her home in Woodstock, Georgia, to join the protests.""I didn't protest before because it sounded so insane that I didn't believe it would pass,"" Borgwat said of Georgia's new law. It's scheduled to take effect on Jan. 1, but opponents have vowed to sue to block it.In St. Louis, several hundred protesters gathered in a park between the Gateway Arch and the historic courthouse where the Dred Scott case decision that deemed black slaves as property, not citizens, was heard.
Katie Lorentz, a 19-year-old college student, said she worries that if she ever needs an abortion she'll be criminalized.""It puts a lot of women in danger,"" Lorentz said of the new law. ""States with strong anti-abortion laws have higher women mortality rates and infant mortality rates.""Ashley Buck, 30, a waitress from St. Louis, held a cardboard sign that read, ""I'm a Pro-Choice Mom"" on one side and ""Ask Me About My 2 Abortions — I Am Not Ashamed"" on the other. She said she had one at age 16, and another at age 27.""My choice,"" Buck said.That same message was echoed by several hundred people gathered in the Utah State Capitol Rotunda. Their chant: ""My body, my choice!""Utah legislators recently passed a ban on abortions after 18 weeks but have agreed not to enforce the ban as a court challenge plays out.In the crowd of abortion rights activists, one counterprotester, Deanna Holland, stood with an anti-abortion sign urging people to care for unborn fetuses.Robert Patrick of the Post-Dispatch contributed to this report.Associated Press reporters Ben Nadler and Sanya Mansoor in Atlanta, Ashraf Khalil and Elena Schor in Washington, Morgan Smith in Salt Lake City and Jim Salter in St. Louis contributed to this report.EDITOR'S NOTE: An earlier version of this story gave an incorrect title for Alison Dreith, deputy director of Hope Clinic for Women.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri abortion law is against Constitution,"May 21, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/mailbag/missouri-abortion-law-is-against-constitution/article_58c14113-a3d5-5376-b888-d388b6c75665.html,"This extreme and dangerous Missouri legislation criminalizes abortion as early as eight weeks, before some women even know they’re pregnant, with no exception for rape or incest. The bill now goes to the desk of Gov. Mike Parson, who has made clear his willingness to sign.

For many Missourians, the unconstitutional ban would remove access to safe abortion. It violates Supreme Court precedent in an attempt to ultimately overturn Roe v Wade. Abortion is an incredibly personal and sometimes complex decision that should and must occur between a pregnant woman, her family and her doctor — not categorically decided by politicians inexperienced in matters of reproductive and maternal health care.

In a state already lacking health care and an abysmal maternal mortality rate that exceeds that of some developing nations, Gov. Parson and anti-choice state lawmakers have made the express decision to fuel the continuing decay of health care in Missouri. They also uphold the egregious claim that the government deserves a hand in the bodily autonomy and deeply personal parenting choices of pregnant Missourians. I call on the governor to reject this unconstitutional ban.Alex Keeley • Kirkwood"
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri officials reject bid to overturn medical marijuana contract,"May 21, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-officials-reject-bid-to-overturn-medical-marijuana-contract/article_93d43069-2eff-55cc-8e9a-a375dcefff7e.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — Missouri officials have rejected a politically connected company’s challenge of a contract to help run the state’s fledgling medical marijuana program.In a decision issued Monday, Gov. Mike Parson’s administration said it was denying a protest by BioTrackTHC, which said the state should not have awarded a contract to a competitor in April because it could contain hidden costs.At issue is a contract to register patients, license facilities and track marijuana from seed to sale.

BioTrackTHC suggested Metrc was able to submit a lower bid to the state because it would charge additional fees to growers and dispensaries.In rejecting the protest, the state said its contract with Metrc does not allow the company to charge additional fees. The 14-page decision, written by Karen Boeger, director of the state's purchasing division, said no further action would be taken.Although it lost its bid to overturn the state’s decision for the estimated $5 million job, BioTrackTHC called the protest a win for the industry because Metrc will not be able to charge additional fees.“We are pleased that the results of the protest reaffirm that additional variable costs to the licensees or the State will not be allowed,” the company said in a statement Tuesday.A spokesman added that the company does not intend to take the matter to court.
“We are satisfied and do not intend to pursue any further action regarding this contract,” said Jeffrey Gonring.As part of its bid to land the state contract, BioTrackTHC hired lobbyist Steve Tilley, a former speaker of the Missouri House. Tilley is co-sponsoring a fundraiser for Parson on Tuesday.
Voters approved Amendment 2 in November, making Missouri the 33rd state to legalize marijuana for medicinal use. Sales are to start early next year. Tax proceeds and licensing fees are supposed to go into a newly created veterans health care fund, which is expected to generate about $20 million per year.BioTrack and Metrc are among the top operators vying to help states administer their marijuana programs. Metrc has contracts with at least 10 states, while BioTrack has seven.In some states, different companies handle the various aspects of operating a medical marijuana program. But Missouri wants one company to do most of the information technology set-up for its licensing and tracking system. The contract with Metrc, if it survives the protest, will run for five years.Missouri is required by law to approve at least 60 commercial growers,86 facilities that manufacture marijuana-infused products and 192 dispensary licenses — 24 dispensaries for each of Missouri’s eight congressional districts.The St. Louis area will probably have more than 48 dispensaries. Two congressional districts cover St. Louis and St. Louis County and parts of St. Charles, Jefferson and Franklin counties.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Without helmet requirement, Missouri likely to see more motorcycle deaths","May 21, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/without-helmet-requirement-missouri-likely-to-see-more-motorcycle-deaths/article_5f909097-bb3f-5fdf-a3b9-77c6b05f6b64.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — The number of motorcycle riders who die in Missouri is likely to increase if Gov. Mike Parson signs off on a new helmet law this summer.According to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, states that have approved laws similar to the bill Missouri lawmakers sent Parson last week have seen fatalities increase by more than a third.“When states enact universal helmet laws, deaths, injuries and medical costs go down. When they repeal those laws, the reverse often happens,” the institute noted in its 2017 annual report.

Before adjourning for the summer on Friday, the House and the Senate approved legislation that would require motorcycle riders under the age of 18 to wear protective headgear. That means adults will be able to go without helmets, as long as they can prove they have health insurance.The legislation has been on the wish list of motorcycle rights groups for years, but it has never made it to a governor’s desk.Tony Shepherd, lobbyist for A Brotherhood Aimed Toward Education, or ABATE, said getting the helmet law across the finish line came as a surprise given its long history of failing.“We are stoked,” the 62-year-old O’Fallon, Mo., resident said. “We’re still in disbelief.”The original sponsor of the proposal is Sen. Eric Burlison, a Springfield Republican who had backed similar legislation during his tenure in the House.The measure awaits Parson’s signature. As a member of the House in the 2000s, Parson twice voted in favor of abolishing the state’s helmet laws. If approved, the change would take effect Aug. 28.Shepherd attributed the win to a new mix of lawmakers in the Senate and the fact that the legislation was just one provision in a larger mix of transportation-related changes that were included in one bill.“It just happened to come at the right time,” Shepherd said.
In the past, there has been resistance largely in the Missouri Senate because operating a motorcycle tends to be more hazardous than operating a car.According to National Highway Transportation Safety Administration, 1,859 motorcyclist lives were saved in 2016 because they were wearing helmets. In addition, if all riders had worn helmets, an additional 802 lives would have been saved, the report notes.According to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, helmets reduce the risk of head injuries from motorcycle crashes by 69 percent and deaths by 37 percent.
Currently, 19 states and the District of Columbia have universal helmet laws requiring all motorcyclists to wear a helmet. Twenty-eight states require only some motorcyclists to wear a helmet. Three states — Illinois, Iowa and New Hampshire — do not have a motorcycle helmet law.According to the institute, when California imposed a helmet law covering all riders in 1992, the number of motorcyclist fatalities dropped by 37 percent.When Texas changed its law in 1977 to require helmets only for riders younger than 18, the state saw a 35 percent increase in motorcycle fatalities. The Lone Star State reinstated its helmet law in 1989 and saw serious injury crashes decrease by 11 percent.In 1997, Texas again weakened its helmet law, requiring helmets only for riders younger than 21. Operator fatalities increased 31 percent in the first full year following the repeal.Shepherd downplayed the statistics, saying he’s crashed his bike with and without a helmet.“It’s about freedom. We want to get the government out of our lives. We’re not outlawing helmets. We are letting you decide,” Shepherd said.The legislation is Senate Bill 147.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Missouri Democrats, in political exile, want GOP to pay price for 'extreme' abortion bill","May 21, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-democrats-in-political-exile-want-gop-to-pay-price/article_42363f02-39f0-51c4-a5a3-bccc9911487e.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — House Minority Leader Crystal Quade said on the last day of the legislative session that she was sorry there were too few Democrats in the capital city to stop a GOP-backed bill that would ban most abortions.“I’m sorry,” Quade, choking up on the House floor, said Friday to abortion rights activists gathered in the Capitol. “I’m sorry there aren’t enough of us in this chamber to stop this. I’m sorry you’re viewed as second-class citizens. Now it’s up to you to change this.”On Saturday, Quade, D-Springfield, sent a fundraising email to her supporters, asking them to donate to her campaign. Democrats control fewer than one-third of state House and Senate seats.

So, in exile, the party is casting the bill — pending before Republican Gov. Mike Parson — as extreme. There are no exemptions allowing abortions in cases of incest or rape. Abortions would be banned at the eighth week of a pregnancy, the only exception being for medical emergencies.And, if the U.S. Supreme Court would overturn Roe v. Wade, nearly all abortions would be made illegal, according to the bill. The only exception would be for medical emergencies.Parson has said he will sign the bill, but it’s still unclear when he will do so.“By signing HB 126, Governor Parson is telling survivors of rape, incest and human trafficking that the whole system is against you,” Auditor Nicole Galloway, a Democrat considering challenging Parson in 2020, said in a statement.“Not only are Governor Parson and Republicans in Jefferson City out of step with the majority of Missourians, they don’t care about women’s health, re-victimizing survivors, or the law,” Galloway said.

When asked why he would sign the bill, given that there are no exceptions for rape or incest, Parson first said that he would sign it because that was the version the Legislature sent him. He later said he believed all life was valuable, regardless of how it was conceived.Jean Peters Baker, chairwoman of the state Democrats, said the bill was “far too extreme to the majority of Missourians” — an angle that may resonate with some of Missouri’s conservative-leaning electorate, who may be ambivalent toward total abortion bans.President Donald Trump said over the weekend he supported a woman’s right to an abortion in cases of rape or incest — a view that, according to a Gallup tracking poll, is likely more in line with national public opinion than the stance the Missouri bill takes.In 2018, 18% of Americans polled believed abortions should be outlawed in all circumstances, according to Gallup.In the same poll, 29% of respondents said abortion should be legal in all circumstances, while 50% said it should be legal only under certain circumstances — suggesting most people have mixed views on the procedure, and that they do not agree with either extreme in the abortion debate.Missouri’s electorate has tended to be more conservative than the nation as a whole, but the near-total ban could signal trouble for some suburban Republicans, where voters have been more receptive to Democrats in recent election cycles.In his St. Louis County district, Rep. Shamed Dogan said, many constituents have nuanced views on abortion.Dogan, of Ballwin, was the only Republican to vote against Missouri’s abortion measure last week. He said he did so because there were no rape or incest exceptions.“I think I’ve only gotten two or three people voicing their opposition who were constituents,” Dogan said. He said more than 100 constituents have contacted him supporting the vote.“These weren’t form emails,” he said. “These were individuals writing in on their own. A lot of them had personal stories. None of these emails was a copy-and-paste.”
Whether abortion resonates as an issue in November 2020 obviously is yet to be determined.Voters rejected a Republican-backed right-to-work law by a wide margin in August 2018. But in November 2018, Democrats did not gain any ground in the Republican-controlled Legislature.On the other hand, Democrat Mike Revis was able to snag a GOP-held Jefferson County House seat in a February 2018 special election in which right-to-work dominated debate.In November, voters in the 99th District in St. Louis County — which borders Dogan’s 98th District — will choose a replacement to former Rep. Jean Evans, R-Manchester, in a special election. She resigned earlier this year to become the executive director of the Missouri Republican Party.
Evans has said she was able to pull off victories in the swing district by knocking on doors and winning over independent voters.Evans won 53% of the vote last year, under-performing then-Democratic U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill, who won 55% of the vote in the 99th District.Democrat Mark Osmack has filed paperwork to run in 2020 against state Sen. Andrew Koenig, R-Manchester.The 15th Senate District includes much of west St. Louis County, including Dogan’s district. Koenig handled the abortion bill in the Senate, and is one of the chamber’s most conservative members.Democrats are betting voters will find Koenig out of step with the district.Indeed, Democrats’ performance in the Kansas City and St. Louis suburbs in 2018 represented one very minor silver lining in an otherwise dismal year for the party.Though McCaskill lost in 2018, and Democrats lost three seats in the Legislature, they also gained three suburban House seats — one centered in Maryland Heights and part of St. Charles, and two in Kansas City.U.S. Rep. Ann Wagner, R-Ballwin, kept her seat in Congress — but narrowly, by fewer than 5 percentage points. Since then, Democrats have said they would spend more resources on the suburban St. Louis seat in 2020.Wagner has started aggressively fundraising in anticipation of the race.The legislation is House Bill 126.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"In his first session as Missouri governor, Parson scores wins","May 19, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/in-his-first-session-as-missouri-governor-parson-scores-wins/article_70e13c18-f192-5da6-ad7f-07f764b7439b.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — When Gov. Mike Parson took over as Missouri’s 57th chief executive nearly a year ago, he pledged to bring calm to a state roiled by the scandal of his predecessor, fellow Republican Eric Greitens.Although the closing month of the legislative session was a rocky ride for the rookie governor, Parson emerged from the five-month legislative session with much of his agenda intact.His so-called “workforce development” push won support after he paired it with a package of subsidies for the General Motors truck and van plant in Wentzville. Lawmakers also delivered on their promise to further restrict abortion in the state, giving Parson some conservative bonafides after being attacked from the right for some of his policy proposals.

And, although his original plan was pared down by Republicans in the House, he received permission to borrow $301 million to fix bridges across the state.“I applaud House and Senate leaders for partnering on the shared priorities of infrastructure and workforce development. Thanks to their leadership we were able to pass a comprehensive economic development strategy for growth across Missouri and take a substantial first step to meeting our state’s infrastructure needs,” Parson said Friday.The five-month session marked Parson’s second significant challenge as governor. While he had largely succeeded in stabilizing state government after the Greitens turmoil, he hadn’t yet navigated a session from the second floor.Parson, a former member of the House and Senate, put that experience to use in his dealings with lawmakers. And, he put together a staff that also brought experience to the table.His team, assembled on the fly after the departure of Greitens, proved deft in working the marble-lined corridors of the House and Senate.Led by chief of staff Aaron Willard and chief legislative director Justin Alferman, the duo sent sometimes recalcitrant lawmakers a strong message: Parson was not going to budge on certain issues, so either get on board or step to the side.“Last year when I became governor, I’m not sure what any of us expected. I’m not sure I knew what I expected,” Parson told reporters Friday. “For the people that have worked in the governor’s office, under the circumstances that they come in here, and for us to hit the ground running back in June, and to stay focused on what the priorities were for this state. You know, I just appreciate the people that work in this office.”Among Parson’s biggest challenge was dealing with a bloc of six conservative senators, who sought to cast Parson as too moderate for their taste when it came to spending and some social issues.During a debate over the General Motors expansion proposal, the caucus suggested that Parson wanted access to a $25 million slush fund without legislative oversight.“Those funds have been plagued with inefficiencies, with mismanagement,” said Sen. Bob Onder, R-Lake Saint Louis, referring to similar funds in other states. “And with these slush funds, there’s always the allegation of pay-to-play corruption.”Asked whether the Conservative Caucus’ lengthy, overnight floor debate was little more than a tantrum over his policies, Parson refused to take the bait.Instead, he said the six members gave up when they realized the end of session plan, choreographed by Parson and Senate leadership, was based on a simple premise: Time.With a 6 p.m. Friday deadline looming and a sweeping abortion bill still unfinished, the caucus sat down, explaining that they didn’t want to block the abortion bill from being completed.“We were faced with a choice whether or not we wanted to continue that discussion on corporate welfare or move the discussion to something more positive on protecting life,” said Sen. Bill Eigel, R-Weldon Spring.After the vote, Parson left his second floor warren of offices to take a victory lap outside of the Senate chambers.“We felt like all along that we were on the right side of this issue and that time would prevail. And time did prevail,” Parson told reporters. “The people who spoke against it had every right to speak against it, but at the end of the day, I truly believe there’s a right thing to do, and that’s why we stayed where we were at.”The legislation includes a four-part plan to help existing businesses and draw new companies to the state, including the $10 million Fast Track program, which will provide scholarships for adult learners to pursue training for high demand industries.It also streamlines the state’s workforce training programs and creates a $25 million deal-closing fund to give Missouri a key negotiating tool to finalize business investment opportunities.And, it gives General Motors $50 million in tax credits if the automaker spends $750 million to upgrade its facility.On top of the workplace development plan, Parson cheered a strict new abortion law, passage of a $30 billion state budget and efforts to change the civil court system to make it better for businesses.
“I thought he had a very successful first session,” said House Speaker Elijah Haahr, R-Springfield. “He’s been very accessible. He understands both the House and the Senate and so he’s always been willing to communicate openly with us. And I’ve had a great working relationship with him.”Good, bad, uglyBut some conservatives remain critical of the governor.Rep. Justin Hill, R-Lake Saint Louis, slammed Parson’s push to borrow money to fix bridges, calling the idea “gross.”“I cannot understand how a Republican-elected majority is going back to the people to borrow money,” Hill said.By contrast, Parson won accolades from business groups for pushing the workplace development proposal across the finish line in the face of an intra-party spat.“Gov. Parson deserves a tremendous amount of credit for the leadership he demonstrated this session. He laid out an aggressive agenda early in session and took a hands-on approach in the Legislature to help it clear serious obstacles. He never backed down, he never wavered and the Missouri business community applauds Gov. Parson for his leadership this session,” said Dan Mehan, executive director of the Missouri Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
Democrats, too, say there is plenty to criticize — even though he has quelled the chaos brought on by his predecessor.“I think we can characterize it as the good, the bad and the ugly,” Rep. Gina Mitten, D-Richmond Heights, said Friday of Parson’s first legislative session. “I think the governor has had some big wins with the bonding bill, certainly with the GM changes.“Obviously there’s been bad, too. We’ve seen joinder and venue and more legislation that will close the courthouse doors to Missourians, particularly in rural areas. And the obvious ugly, which is the abortion legislation passed today.”The governor didn’t get everything he wanted. He had sought to reform the state’s low-income housing tax credit program, but a series of changes floundered in the final month of the session. A plan to fight opioid abuse by creating a prescription drug monitoring program ran aground in the Senate again over privacy concerns.Parson also failed to convince lawmakers to approve a framework for collecting online sales taxes after conservatives vowed to block any plan that did not include a corresponding decrease in income taxes.Parson, who runs a cattle operation in Bolivar, is expected to take a break from Jefferson City before he begins acting on the various pieces of legislation headed toward his desk.Tentative summer plans include attending the Paris Air Show in June and potentially heading overseas in August for a trade mission.He’ll also be moving out of the Governor’s Mansion, which is undergoing repairs, and into a house at a National Guard training base near Jefferson City.Parson also will be raising money for his 2020 campaign for a full four-year term.With state Auditor Nicole Galloway, the only Democrat elected to statewide office, showing signs that she is running for governor, Parson and his allies have raised over $3 million for the looming fight.On Tuesday, he’ll add more to his campaign chest at a fundraiser in St. Louis.Jack Suntrup of the Post-Dispatch contributed to this report.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Yes, GM subsidy is corporate welfare, but it's necessary in a competitive world","May 19, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/business/columns/david-nicklaus/yes-gm-subsidy-is-corporate-welfare-but-it-s-necessary/article_16b61472-0826-50c1-a929-9dbe11bd1ef1.html,"It’s hard to argue that a $50 million state subsidy for an automaker isn’t corporate welfare, but Rob Dixon doesn’t like the term.Dixon, Missouri’s director of economic development, had to defend Gov. Mike Parson’s administration against conservatives’ slings and arrows during debate over one of the governor’s priorities, a bill that offers General Motors incentives to invest $1 billion in its Wentzville plant.

Republican critics said the bill made the state pick economic winners and losers, using a new “deal closing fund” that amounted to a slush fund. It’s no such thing, Dixon says: The fund provides flexibility in handing out some Missouri Works tax credits, but still requires clawbacks if a company fails to create jobs.As for the corporate welfare label, the criticism applies to much of what Dixon’s department does, which is handing incentives to companies that invest in the state.Missouri competes with other states, and Dixon doesn’t see unilateral disarmament as an option. “Every state uses incentive tools,” he said. “Whether you like it or not, they are indisputably a part of the economic development competition across the country.”Indeed, Alabama dangled $700 million last year to win a joint Toyota-Mazda plant. Wisconsin offered Foxconn $4.8 billion to lure a giant electronics factory, although the company now seems likely to build something much smaller.Missouri has never played in such a pricey league, and the new economic development bill doesn’t change that. In fact, Dixon says, it allocates no more money than the state was spending under existing programs.“We think we’re being somewhat conservative and fiscally responsible with this program,” he said.The bill extends a program created in 2010 to encourage a Ford expansion in Kansas City. The GM subsidies could start in 2023, after the old law’s funding ends, at up to $10 million a year.
GM hasn’t said whether it will add jobs in Wentzville, but Dixon argues that keeping the current 3,500 jobs is critical. “They have a major impact on our state economy and on the everyday lives of millions of Missourians,” he said.GM contributes $2 billion a year to Missouri’s economy and supports 12,000 jobs at suppliers and other businesses, the state says.It’s important to note that GM is shrinking its overall production capacity. “You fight for those kinds of jobs every chance you get,” says Steve Johnson, chief executive of the St. Louis Regional Economic Development Alliance. “Talk to the people in Lordstown and see if they think you can take these jobs for granted.”He’s referring to Lordstown, Ohio, where GM ended auto production two months ago. The company also may close four other plants in North America.
Incentives, Johnson says, help make the case that GM should invest in Wentzville and not somewhere else. “The competition for capital within a company is fierce,” he said. “Sometimes communities assume that they’re not going to walk away, but expansion projects of this sort are every bit as competitive as a green-field project.”The new economic development bill does invest in people as well as companies: It provides financial aid for adults, over age 25, who return to school for education or training in a high-demand field such as computer science, nursing or welding.That part of the bill should improve the state’s long-term future, because most firms say a lack of suitable workers is their biggest barrier to growth.Meanwhile, subsidizing GM should ensure that the region doesn’t lose some of its highest-paying manufacturing jobs. Unfortunately, fierce competition for such jobs has made corporate welfare a necessary evil.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,The push for a statewide prescription drug monitoring program failed again. Why is Missouri the last holdout?,"May 19, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/lifestyles/health-med-fit/the-push-for-a-statewide-prescription-drug-monitoring-program-failed/article_54652e23-6de8-5541-a997-c4b18cfd4b97.html,"ST. LOUIS — Missouri retained its lonely title as the only state without a statewide prescription drug monitoring program — for the seventh year in a row — after the legislative session ended Friday.Patient advocates, politicians, experts and members of the medical community had hoped this would finally be the year Missouri would create a statewide electronic database designed to help spot the abuse of prescription drugs. After all, Republican Gov. Mike Parson had pushed for it and, more important, its longtime opponent was no longer in office to block it.But, because of ongoing fears about privacy violations tangled up with gun control, the bill never got a full Senate vote. And finance site WalletHub last week ranked Missouri third worst in the country for its drug use based on a review of arrests, overdose rates, opioid prescriptions and other measures.

Katie Reichard, a lobbyist with Missouri Primary Care Association who has been working in and around the Missouri Legislature for almost 15 years and previously pushed for the issue, said this proposal has bedeviled the state capital as none other while the opioid crisis continues to rage nationwide.“I’ve never seen anything take seven years to get anywhere, and especially something that’s going to be put into place to save lives.”Missouri’s cities, neighboring states and the federal government have been forced to create a patchwork of incomplete workarounds. Those include a voluntary program tracking patients’ prescriptions run by St. Louis County that receives federal funding and a statewide monitoring system put into place by former Republican Gov. Eric Greitens that tracks physicians’ prescriptions.And yet, the state cannot seem to legislate a complete fix. “It’s frustrating to watch the rest of the country get this done and watch Missouri be the last one,” said Dr. Sam Page, the St. Louis County prescription drug monitoring program architect and current St. Louis County Executive.To be sure, the databases don’t eliminate the ability of drug abusers to acquire prescription opioids. But the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has called such statewide patient monitoring databases “among the most promising state-level interventions” to improve opioid prescribing and protect at-risk patients.It’s an embarrassment Missouri can’t figure out its own statewide system, said St. Joseph pharmacist JulieMarie Nickelson. “No one in the pharmacy or medical world really understands it,” she said.Privacy, guns and oppositionWhile a drug-monitoring bill has been introduced every year in the Legislature since 2005, it was initially championed by the minority Democratic Party, which meant it didn’t have much of a shot at passing until 2012.Then New Hampshire approved a statewide program in 2012, leaving Missouri as the sole holdout. That pressure, combined with an uptick in awareness of drug abuse, led to a swell of bipartisan agreement.A statewide drug monitoring bill passed the Missouri House handily that year, then met its biggest adversary: Republican state Sen. Robert Schaaf, whose district stretched from Kansas City to St. Joseph along Missouri’s western border.Since then, Schaaf — who is also a family physician — filibustered or insisted on kill clauses that would never pass the House, citing his concerns over privacy and personal liberty issues along with his belief it was an ineffective tool. Year after year, his efforts defeated drug monitoring bills.Schaaf has said the risk of a database of patient information being hacked — and the government having access to the information — far outweighed the potential benefits. He also tapped into underlying fears of privacy violations, driven in part by a 2013 scandal over the Missouri Highway Patrol turning over a database of concealed weapons permit holders to a federal agent.“I’ve always been opposed to taking private citizens’ information and putting it on a government database to which many, many people have access,” he told Kaiser Health News. “My understanding is there is no computer information to which the NSA is not privy. How long is it going to be ’til this is used to pare down the number of people with concealed weapons or weapons at all?”By stoking privacy fears and connecting them to gun rights, Schaaf also helped tap into grassroots far-right opposition that lives on to this day. A YouTube video tweeted by opponents of prescription drug monitoring programs details how the St. Louis County system could be used in “passing your personal information on to the federal government, which could use it to infringe on your right to bear arms.”To date, the only reported hack has been of Virginia’s database, though it is unclear if the hackers were able to access medical records.Over the years, Missouri’s drug monitoring advocates, led by Republican Rep. Holly Rehder, unsuccessfully tried to assuage such concerns by offering amendments to delete records older than three years and to ensure medical information could not be tied to buying a gun. And while Schaaf did an about-face in 2017 and agreed to stop filibustering the proposal, he effectively killed it with his only stipulation: that all physicians be required to use it. That measure, which took away the inherent voluntary aspect of the program, failed in the House.“If they’re going to take our liberty away for something that’s never been proven to work, doctors have to use it,” Schaaf told Kaiser Health News.
The former head of the St. Louis County Health Department, Faisal Khan, who in 2017 helped start the voluntary county-based prescription drug monitoring program that now covers other portions of the state, claims the opposition goes deeper than what he called “totally unfounded” privacy concerns.“They view St. Louis County and St. Louis city and St. Louis, in general, as this liberal Democratic bastion that they don’t want anything to do with,” he said. “It’s the usual nonsense that we’re seeing around the country at the moment, and it’s stymying progress in the parts of the state where we need it the most.”But this year, Schaaf had hit his term limit of eight years in office and did not return to the Missouri Senate. Passing a prescription drug monitor program finally seemed within reach — until a group of six Republican state senators formed a new conservative caucus and filibustered yet again over the issue, citing the same privacy issues and civil liberties.“The conservative caucus has carried his torch on,” Reichard said.A series of workarounds Now, because the legislature has refused to move on the issue, cities, states and the federal government must continue to rely on the stopgaps they created to help address the opioid problem ravaging Missouri.Today, 72 jurisdictions have opted into St. Louis County’s voluntary prescription drug monitoring system so pharmacists and doctors could check a patient’s other prescriptions. It now covers 84% of the state’s population.
Even St. Joseph, one of the areas hardest hit by the opioid epidemic and where Schaaf lives, joined last year.For Nickelson, a pharmacist at Rogers Pharmacy in the city of about 76,000 people, the voluntary database means she no longer has to spend upward of 30 minutes on the phone tracking down whether a patient had prescriptions for drugs elsewhere.“It’s really helpful to us as it makes it so we can make sure that patients aren’t taking medications that interact and can increase risk for an overdose,” she said. “We just want to make sure our patients are safe, and we want to make sure medication that’s not necessary doesn’t get into the community.”Since her city’s voluntary PDMP has been in effect, she estimates she sees a handful fewer people each week who were doctor-shopping, a particular risk considering the pharmacy is less than 5 miles from the Kansas border.Missouri was a premier destination for pill-shopping, Page said, but that’s changed.“Our PDMP is first-class, as any in the country,” Page said. “We have gaps, but those will continue to fill in. If the state continues to not move forward with this, then St. Louis County will continue to do the right thing.”And while St. Louis County built its voluntary database in part with $200,000 from the U.S. Department of Justice, interstate sharing of the data with neighboring Illinois, Kansas and Oklahoma didn’t happen until February. Eight states border Missouri and more states are expected to collaborate with St. Louis County’s system this year. But data-sharing can occur only among states that have managed to bend or rewrite their regulations to accommodate the one state in the nation without a statewide program.Tennessee even created and passed legislation to allow it to communicate with the St. Louis County program while Missouri was still haggling over its PDMP bill, according to Spring Schmidt, acting head of the St. Louis County Department of Public Health.The system that Greitens created when governor, along with Express Scripts, to monitor physicians’ prescriptions for unusual patterns led to 50 referrals to the Missouri Healing Arts Board — the disciplinary board for medical practitioners in Missouri — for prescribing issues since March 2018, according to Missouri’s head of Health and Senior Services, Dr. Randall Williams.Ideally, Williams said, he would love to combine a statewide version of the voluntary PDMP system with Greitens’ physician-monitoring one, but he’s waiting on the legislation.Reichard can’t help but wonder why the state won’t join the rest of the nation in passing it.“I’m not saying do what everyone else is doing,” she said. “But if 49 other legislatures are saying ‘This is important, we need to save lives,’ I don’t understand why Missouri can’t find a way to compromise and do what’s best for its citizens.”Kaiser Health News is a nonprofit news service covering health issues.

Eric Greitens improperly used his office staff to work on his campaign's social media accounts.

The Kansas City Star reported that Schmitt's announcement concludes what is believed to be the last investigation into alleged wrongdoing during Greitens' administration. Greitens resigned last spring amid allegations of sexual misconduct and campaign finance violations.

Former Attorney General Josh Hawley, now a U.S. senator, began an investigation last year into whether taxpayer resources were illegally misused and whether Greitens and his staff violated Missouri's open records laws.Schmitt's office said Thursday that the issue is closed. New Gov. Mike Parson's office has signed agreements essentially promising that he and future governors will use best practices in using social media and email.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri voters to decide on more term limits,"May 18, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-voters-to-decide-on-more-term-limits/article_a825a688-7b56-56bd-98c4-7fbfcc3b6d22.html,"JEFFERSON CITY •  Missouri voters will decide next year whether to impose term limits on all statewide elected officials following action Friday by the Legislature.

Lawmakers gave final approval Friday to a proposed constitutional amendment to limit the lieutenant governor, secretary of state, auditor and attorney general to being elected to two four-year terms.

That would match term limits already in place for the governor and state treasurer. State legislators already are limited to two four-year terms in the Senate and four two-year terms in the House.The amendment on executive-branch term limits will appear on the November 2020 ballot unless Gov. Mike Parson schedules an earlier vote.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Near-total ban on abortion approved by Missouri House, heads to governor","May 18, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/near-total-ban-on-abortion-approved-by-missouri-house-heads/article_0c275d72-6791-5d70-8505-f3b4c524429f.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — Drawing jeers from activists seated in the Missouri House, lawmakers on Friday approved a sweeping piece of anti-abortion legislation, a bill that would ban most abortions in the state of Missouri.The final vote was 110-44, and the proposal now heads to Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican, who is expected to sign the measure.“We’re told abortion will not be safe if it is illegal. I’m here to tell you abortion is not safe,” said Rep. Mary Elizabeth Coleman, R-Arnold, one of the proposal’s main backers. “A person dies in every procedure.”

The proposal is designed to trigger a court challenge that the GOP sees as a way of overturning the landmark Roe v. Wade decision that made abortion legal nationwide. The measure has drawn nationwide scrutiny, and its passage brought an emotional end to Missouri’s five-month legislative session.The bill bans abortions in the state of Missouri at eight weeks of pregnancy, except when the life of the mother is threatened. There are no exceptions for rape, incest or human trafficking.“If we are in fact pro-life what kind of hypocrite would I be to not have a bill that is 100 percent pro-life?” asked Rep. Adam Schnelting, R-St. Charles, one of the main backers of the proposal.He said the purpose of the bill is to “optimize” life — his rationale for including exemptions in cases where the life of the mother is in jeopardy.The legislation also bans a woman from aborting a fetus that might have Down syndrome. It also requires both parents or guardians to be notified before minors can get an abortion, in most cases.The measure says anyone “who knowingly performs or induces an abortion” in cases that are not exempted by the legislation would be guilty of a Class B felony, which carries a minimum five-year prison sentence.If the Supreme Court overturns Roe vs. Wade, “in whole or in part,” the legislation states that all abortions would be made illegal except in cases of a medical emergency.The bill drew condemnation from Democrats, who control less than one-third of the state’s House seats.“Laundry bleach, acid, bitter concoction, knitting needles, bicycle spokes, ballpoint pens, jumping from the top of the stairs or the roof,” said Rep. Sarah Unsicker, D-Shrewsbury. “These are ways that women around the world who don’t have access to legal abortion perform their own.”Rep. Barbara Washington, D-Kansas City, said Missouri was not a pro-life state as long as children lose Medicaid coverage, or receive free and reduced-price lunches.“We support the death penalty in this state,” she said. “That is anti-life.”“This gives more rights to the rapists than it does the mother,” said Rep. Doug Beck, D-south St. Louis County. “Perpetrators of incest would have more rights.“This law is barbaric. We should rethink this,” he said.Rep. Rocky Miller, R-Lake Ozark, said that he “was involved” in an abortion when he was a young man.“I did not know what I was doing,” Miller said. He said he would vote for the anti-abortion measure. “Missouri takes a giant step forward to save life today. And I thank God for that.”Rep. Barry Hovis, R-Cape Girardeau, was met with hisses when he used the phrase “consensual rape” during debate.He said most of the sexual assaults he handled before retiring from law enforcement weren’t strangers “jumping out of the bushes” but instead “date rapes or consensual rapes.” Abortion-rights supporters who attended the debate hissed in response.As a vote on the abortion bill grew closer, dozens of activists started chanting from the chamber gallery.“When you lie, people die,” they shouted as doormen cleared the activists from the gallery. “Shame on you!”One Republican voted “no.” Rep. Shamed Dogan, R-Ballwin, said: “I really struggled with this one. I wanted to, as we talked about earlier, include rape and incest exceptions.”Rep. Steve Butz, D-St. Louis, who took an anti-abortion stance during a Democratic primary last year, ultimately voted “no” on the bill. He said it was because there were no exceptions included for rape or incest.
Missouri’s lawsMissouri already has some of the toughest abortion regulations in the country. There is one clinic in the state, in St. Louis’ Central West End neighborhood, but clinics also operate in the Metro East, in Granite City and Fairview Heights. Planned Parenthood operates a clinic in Kansas, near Kansas City, Mo.In 2017, lawmakers approved, and then-Gov. Eric Greitens signed into law, a round of abortion regulations that proponents said would protect the health and safety of women.It requires that doctors explain the risks of abortion to women 72 hours before an abortion is performed. The law added annual inspections of clinics and new whistleblower protections for employees of clinics, and boosted requirements for pathologists who provide services to abortion facilities.At the time, there was no clear conservative majority on the U.S. Supreme Court.But with Justice Brett Kavanaugh winning confirmation to the bench last year, anti-abortion activists in Missouri and elsewhere are hopeful the 5-4 conservative majority will reconsider the 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision.Encouraged by that majority, some conservative states are moving to ban most abortions outright.“Today, the Missouri House stood for the unborn,” House Speaker Elijah Haahr, R-Springfield, said in a statement. “Every child has an intrinsic value given to them by the Creator of life. The bold legislation we sent to the Governor’s desk is the strongest and most comprehensive pro-life bill in the country.”Abortion statistics
In Missouri, the number of recorded abortions has declined in recent years.In 2015, there were 4,311 abortions completed here on Missouri residents, according to the Department of Health and Senior Services.By 2017, the year the previous round of regulations took effect, there were 3,522 abortions completed here on Missouri residents, according to the department.At the same time, the number of abortions sought by Missouri residents out of state has increased.Out-of-state abortions sought by Missouri residents totaled 3,163 in 2015, according to the state. That total dipped in 2016 before increasing to 3,268 in 2017.Data on out-of-state abortions sought by Missouri women for 2018 were not available, a spokeswoman said, and some states do not report data back to the state DHSS, the spokeswoman said.Dr. Erin King, executive director of the Hope Clinic in Granite City, said the clinic will work with patients from conservative states such as Missouri who may lose access to abortion services.“Our doors remain open for any patient who needs abortion care,” she said in a statement. “We will do everything in our power to make sure that further barriers like expenses associated with seeking this care such as traveling long distances, time off from work, and childcare are lessened to the best of our ability.”The legislation is House Bill 126.The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"In bid to help tourism, Missouri lawmakers approve later school start date","May 18, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/in-bid-to-help-tourism-missouri-lawmakers-approve-later-school/article_05e2169b-3f52-53d6-b4f1-4346ac0425be.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — Over the objections of local school superintendents, Missouri lawmakers have approved legislation barring schools from starting classes before late August.The measure, which now heads to Gov. Mike Parson’s desk, was among scores of bills that moved through the House and Senate on the Legislature’s final day of the 2019 session.In all, the Republican-controlled chambers sent more than 40 bills to Parson, including one that would place strict limits on abortion in the Show-Me State.

The school starting date legislation would set the first day of school for K-12 districts no earlier than 14 days before the first Monday in September.It moved out of the House on a 116-25 vote Friday.Supporters, including Lt. Gov. Mike Kehoe, argue that earlier school start dates are affecting the tourism industry as more families end their summer vacations in early August.The change could give tourism-related businesses one more summer weekend to make money.The legislation was included in a package of school-related changes to state law that moved through both chambers on the final day of the Legislature’s annual session.In the coming school year, most St. Louis area school districts are set to start in mid-August. St. Louis Public Schools are to open Aug. 13.Among those favoring the prohibition were amusement park operators and lobbying groups representing hotel owners, campground owners and river outfitters.Opponents included the Missouri School Boards’ Association, which said the decision should be made locally.An early start can mean finishing a semester and squeezing in final exams before winter break. It allows more learning to take place before standardized tests are given in the spring. And it can prevent holding classes in June to make up for snow days after a harsh winter.The legislation is House Bill 604.Bridge funding planAlso heading to Parson’s desk is a short-term bridge funding plan sought by the governor after voters in November rejected an increase in the state’s motor fuel tax.The Republican-led House voted 107-31 in support of the plan, which is designed to pay for repairs to 215 bridges across the state.“This is not a long-term solution by any means,” said Rep. Kip Kendrick, D-Columbia. “We’ve put ourselves in a dangerous situation. We can’t go years without addressing a long-term solution.”Parson initially sought to borrow $351 million to finance the upgrades to be paid back over 15 years.Lawmakers balked and agreed to a $301 million bond package that would be paid out over seven years.“This has been truly a compromise solution,” said House Budget Chairman Cody Smith, a Jasper County Republican.Parson, a Republican, has made funding bridge projects a priority this legislative session, saying the state must find a long-term plan to fix the state’s roads and bridges.It will cost about $46.1 million a year to pay back the loan. Interest will amount to about $22.6 million.The proposal would devote $50 million in general revenue next fiscal year to jump-start the bridge replacement program. An additional $35 million would go toward a cost-share program for infrastructure improvements with counties and cities.It also allows the state to issue the bonds only if the state wins a federal infrastructure grant. One grant application seeks money to replace the Interstate 70 bridge in Rocheport; another application seeks money for bridge repairs.Officials have said the state is more likely to win federal money if it commits some of its own resources to the repairs. Parson has said that if the state devotes money toward the bridge repairs, it would free up dollars for road repairs.While the infusion of state and federal money would be a catalyst to repair long-term assets, the spending would not erase the state’s infrastructure backlog.
The legislation is Senate Concurrent Resolution 14.Motorcyle helmet lawThe House and Senate signed off on a package of transportation-related changes in state law, including one that would lift the requirement that all riders wear protective headwear.Motorcycle riders under the age of 18 would still need to wear a helmet. Those over 18 could go without if they have health insurance.During earlier debate, lawmakers agreed motorcyclists should wear helmets, but some said the choice should be a matter of personal freedom.“I think there’s a limit of what government should be involved in our lives,” Sen. David Sater, R-Cassville said.Opponents were quick to point out that drivers of other vehicles are subject to their own safety requirements and began listing statistics on motorcycle accidents.More than 5,000 motorcyclists died in 2017 according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The NHTSA, a branch of the Federal Department of Transportation, found the crashes result in billions of dollars in hospital bills each year, costs that are lower in states that require all motorcyclists to wear helmets.
“We’re going to be paying for this,” Sen. Bill White, R-Joplin said. “That’s where your freedom stops is when it enters my pocket book.”The legislation package, including other transportation provisions, passed 21-12. The House sent the legislation to the governor on a 94-46 vote.The legislation is SB 147.Vehicle emissions testThe House and Senate backed off a plan to end vehicle emissions tests, which have been taking place for decades in the city of St. Louis, and St. Louis, St. Charles, Jefferson and Franklin counties.Senate President Pro Tem Dave Schatz wanted to end the testing because air quality has improved in the region and newer cars emit less pollution.But, lawmakers refused because doing so could potentially cost the state millions of dollars in federal funding.Schatz, R-Sullivan, said he didn’t want to leave the Missouri Department of Transportation with a $211 million hole in its budget.Because of high ozone levels, the St. Louis region is the only area in Missouri where emissions testing is required when motorists go to renew their license plates. Automobiles are the largest source of the chemicals that form ozone, but factories, utilities, the petroleum industry and industrial solvents also contribute.Ozone is a respiratory irritant that can cause health problems, especially for children, the elderly and people with heart and lung diseases.In addition to potentially losing federal dollars, a fiscal analysis shows the state would lose $2.8 million in license fee receipts it collects to pay for the program.The emissions testing language was stripped out of a larger bill that includes an increase in driver’s license fees, to $6 from $3.50 for one year and to $12 from $7 for two years.Title transfer fees, instructional permits, chauffeur’s licenses and other specialty licenses would increase to $6 from $2.50.The proposal, sponsored by Rep. Jeff Knight, R-Lebanon, is designed to help license offices in rural areas cover increasing costs. Along with an increase in the minimum wage, the offices must use specific types of office equipment, Knight said.The fees have not been increased since 1999.In addition to boosting revenue for the office operators, the proposal would generate $22.4 million for the state’s highway fund. Cities would receive $4.5 million and counties would see a share of $2.9 million.The legislation is House Bill 499.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Editorial: Short takes on 'talking telegraphs' and deep-sea trash,"May 17, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-short-takes-on-talking-telegraphs-and-deep-sea-trash/article_50ef3fed-c8e8-55c6-85ee-e1dad2e174af.html,"Parson invokes invention of ‘talking telegraph’Missouri Gov. Mike Parson is expected to be the top ambassador touting this state’s hi-tech prowess and modern infrastructure capable of attracting new employers and investors. His six-minute interview on National Public Radio Wednesday accomplished exactly the opposite — not so much for anything he said but for the abysmal quality of the phone equipment he was using.The interview was almost intelligible at the start, but the longer it lasted, the more it sounded as if Parson were speaking through a long irrigation tube on his farm while crushing graham crackers into the mouthpiece. The connection quality degraded to the point where almost nothing was understandable.

We live in cost-conscious times, for sure. But it seems the governor’s office could spring for a few extra dollars to upgrade his phone so he doesn’t embarrass the state and invoke the olden days when Missourians communicated using a new device called the “talking telegraph.”Tree muggersA California couple wanted a massive, protected 180-year oak tree on their property to be in different spot. So they had it dug up and transplanted, killing it in the process. Fittingly, a judge has now fined them almost $600,000 for their little landscape project.For close to two centuries, the majestic tree stood in a wooded area north of San Francisco, on land now owned by Toni and Peter Thompson. Although there’s a conservation easement requiring the land to stay in its natural state, the couple wanted the tree, and two others, moved to another location. So they ignored the easement and brought in the backhoes, to disastrous outcome.In a searing ruling, Judge Patrick M. Broderick sided with the land trust and fined the couple $586,000 to fund restoration efforts. He cited their efforts to hide what they did and obstruct the investigation.The couple’s lawyer protested that they are “responsible, law-abiding citizens” who love the land. Funny way of showing it.Trump 2.0It appears college student John Lambert, a co-founder of the national campus group Students for Trump, is perfectly suited for promoting the ethos of our 45th president: Lambert has been charged with posing online as a high-powered lawyer to fleece unwitting “clients.”During and after the 2016 election, Lambert became a celebrity for young fans of President Donald Trump. He traveled to various college campuses, touting Trump’s policies and pushing back on the narrative that students tend to oppose him.But federal prosecutors allege that Lambert, operating out of North Carolina, invented an online persona named Eric Pope, described as a prominent New York attorney, and used it to bilk unwary people seeking legal services out of tens of thousands of dollars.In Trump’s younger days, he used to talk himself up to reporters while pretending to be a non-existent spokesman named John Barron. He also was sued for ripping off students of the now-defunct Trump University. If Lambert beats the rap, maybe there’s a cabinet post for him.Deep-sea dumpsterThe deepest ocean dive ever undertaken has yielded some intriguing sights, and a depressing one: human trash, in the furthest depths that human eyes have ever glimpsed.
Explorer Victor Vescovo recently unveiled details of his history-making dive in the southern Pacific Ocean, part of a mission to chart the deepest parts of the globe. Inside a submersible called The Limiting Factor, Vescovo descended seven miles, to the bottom of the Pacific’s Marianna Trench. It is the deepest manned sea dive on record.In those never-before-seen depths, Vescovo came across what are believed to be several previously unknown species of fish.He also came across a plastic bag and some candy wrappers.An estimated 100 million tons of trash are in the world’s oceans, with some 8 million more added every year.
Crime shouldn’t payFormer St. Louis County Executive Steve Stenger had been on track to eventually get a county pension despite pleading guilty to corruption in office. But as the Post-Dispatch’s Jeremy Kohler reports, County Council member Tim Fitch wants the council to create a law like the one that already governs Missouri state employees: If they’re convicted of a felony committed in relation to their official duties, they forfeit their pensions.Stenger will be sentenced Aug. 9 and could face three to four years in prison. Yet under current statute, that combined with his resignation in disgrace from office wouldn’t prevent him from collecting his county pension as early as 2032.As Fitch puts it: “If he was committing crimes while he was in his elected position, why would taxpayers want to pay his pension for the rest of his life?” Good question.The next small stepHalf a century after Neil Armstrong first walked on the moon, NASA is planning to release some long-sealed samples of moon rocks to scientists to be tested with technology that wasn’t available when they were first brought to Earth.Much of the more than 800 pounds of rocks and soil collected during the six Apollo moon missions from 1969 through 1972 remain vacuum sealed or frozen, untouched by human hands on Earth.Testing on some samples offered clues about the origins of both the moon and Earth. Other material was preserved on the assumption that future scientists with advanced technology could make deeper discoveries.Scientists will test samples for trapped water molecules and other secrets — an apt way to mark the July 20 anniversary of Armstrong’s first walk 50 years ago.Of course, they aren’t unsealing all of it. Who knows what scientists 50 years from now might be able to learn?EDITOR'S NOTE: The final item in Short Takes has been updated to correct the date of the first moon walk."
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Most St. Louis aldermen blast Legislature's move to ban most abortions,"May 17, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/most-st-louis-aldermen-blast-legislature-s-move-to-ban/article_b1d894ff-8c7b-5be5-82f5-232b2874f13f.html,"ST. LOUIS  •  Aldermanic President Lewis Reed and 23 of the 28 ward aldermen on Friday issued a statement blasting what they called the ""draconian"" bill to ban most abortions passed by the Missouri Legislature.""This alarming bill seeks to ban a woman's access to safe and legal abortions in our state and outlaws abortion just eight weeks into pregnancy, which is often much sooner than a woman even knows she is pregnant,"" the statement said.The statement, issued after the Board of Aldermen held its regular weekly meeting, also complained that the Legislature has failed to consider or pass key initiatives to improve health care for women and children such as expansion of Medicaid.

The state measure was given final approval about the same time by the Missouri House and sent to Gov. Mike Parson, a supporter, for his signature.
The aldermanic statement also said state lawmakers haven't dealt with the state's rates of death and injury from gun violence, an ""out of control"" incidence of syphilis and the ""opioid crisis.""""If Governor Parson and the Missouri General Assembly are truly concerned about Missouri women's health and 'life', we suggest starting with any of these urgent problems in our state,"" the group said.
City Treasurer Tishaura Jones, a former state representative, also endorsed the statement. Alderman Christine Ingrassia of the 6th Ward gathered support for the statement.The five aldermen who didn't back the statement were Joe Vollmer of the 10th Ward, Larry Arnowitz of the 12th, Tom Oldenburg of the 16th, Joe Roddy of the 17th and Joe Vaccaro of the 23rd.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Rep. Bruce Franks quitting Missouri House, cites family and mental health issues","May 17, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/rep-bruce-franks-quitting-missouri-house-cites-family-and-mental/article_7cc0982b-60ae-56a4-b4b7-4b9d48fffd22.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — A high-profile member of the St. Louis-area delegation in the Missouri Legislature is calling it quits after less than three years in office.Rep. Bruce Franks, who rode into the Capitol after challenging the status quo in a contested election in 2016, said he is stepping down with a year left in his term to tend to his mental health and his family.“It’s about taking a step back,” Franks said in an interview Thursday.

Franks announced his decision to his colleagues in the Missouri House on the second-to-last day of the legislative session.The 34-year-old activist and community organizer moved into the public eye in 2014 during protests over a Ferguson police officer’s fatal shooting of Michael Brown.He parlayed that notoriety in 2016 to unseat Democrat Penny Hubbard in the 78th House District, which takes in downtown St. Louis, most of the near north side and parts of the city’s south side.In Jefferson City, Franks worked to bridge the rural-urban divide that dominates policy discussions under the Dome. His floor speeches often brought hushed tones to the Legislature’s lower chamber as he called for compromise and comity.He said he was proud of winning support from the Republican majority to fund youth programs in St. Louis during his abbreviated tenure.“I was able to build some bridges,” Franks said. “But I feel like I can be more effective outside the system.”“I am not resigning my role as a leader in my community,” he added.In 2017, Franks helped lead protests after former St. Louis police officer Jason Stockley was found not guilty of murder in the death of drug suspect Anthony Lamar Smith.Critics said a lawmaker should not be advocating for people to stage protests.His decision comes after St. Louis Mayor Lyda Krewson launched an investigation and called for a state audit in January of a city jobs agency amid reports of financial mismanagement.
At the time, television station KMOV reported there were discrepancies in time sheets submitted by Franks, who worked as a youth mentor through the program with reported work hours not matching up with events and locations posted on Franks’ social media pages.Franks said the mentoring job associated with the St. Louis Agency on Training and Employment, or SLATE, was not a typical 9-to-5 office position and included late night phone calls.In August, Franks filed for bankruptcy, saying his sole income is derived from being a state representative: $2,993 a month. He did not report any income from his mentoring position, which he left in February.
Franks said his decision to resign was not motivated by the taint of scandal, but by a desire to show people of color that they can address mental health issues.He said he has been wracked by anxiety and depression brought on by “survivors guilt.” On his desk in the Capitol is a collage of recently deceased family and friends.“In December I hit bottom. I’ve lost a lot of people,” Franks said. “We don’t talk about it. We are elected officials, but we are humans.”

            From Ferguson protester to state legislator, Bruce Franks Jr. says he will never stop fighting





Franks had signaled he wanted to run for Sen. Jamilah Nasheed’s 5th Senate District seat when she is forced out by term limits after the November 2020 election.He didn’t rule out a future run for office, but said he’s relieved to have made a decision to end his service in the House.“I feel like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders,” he said.A special election to fill the post could be scheduled for November by Gov. Mike Parson.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,All eyes will be on the Missouri House Friday for abortion bill vote,"May 17, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/all-eyes-will-be-on-the-missouri-house-friday-for/article_1ea1da4b-d7ee-5f71-a6fa-d96eeabcc1f4.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — Shortly before 4 a.m. Thursday, the Missouri Senate pushed through a tough anti-abortion bill. Republicans declared victory for the unborn.Several hours later, staff at the Planned Parenthood clinic in the Central West End — the only abortion clinic in Missouri — began getting calls. National media had begun to notice.“I’ve been shuffling media around all morning,” said Jesse Lawder, spokesman for Planned Parenthood. “National, international, local — and they’re just showing up. Like I got a call from CBS Evening News this morning. They’re like, we’re at the airport.”

All eyes will be on the Missouri House Friday, where state representatives likely will approve the measure. They face a deadline of 6 p.m., when the legislative session ends.The House passed a version of the bill earlier this year, but because the Senate made changes, the House needs to vote again before sending the measure to Gov. Mike Parson’s desk.One of the most striking changes overnight was offered by Republicans. Under the House legislation, abortions would have been banned if a fetal heartbeat could be detected, which can occur as early as six weeks into a pregnancy.But GOP senators removed the fetal heartbeat language, replacing it with a strict eight-week ban on abortions. That language, they reasoned, may better withstand court challenges.Missouri is joining an effort with other states to tighten restrictions on abortion and give the U.S. Supreme Court a chance to rescind abortion rights.The measure approved by the Missouri Senate would be one of the toughest anti-abortion laws in the nation: It allows abortions in medical emergencies, but makes no exceptions in cases of rape, incest or human trafficking.Lawder, of Planned Parenthood, predicted that if the vast majority of abortions are outlawed in Missouri, patients would head to Illinois where abortion is more accessible.“The mood here is — is, I mean, people here are really concerned about what this means for patients,” he said.Democrats spent most of the day Wednesday filibustering the measure in the Missouri Capitol.And Republicans worked all night to get it passed.By 4 p.m., the Senate recessed and Democrats and GOP Senate leadership met for behind-the-scenes negotiations.At 5:30 p.m., the governor, a Republican, held a campaign-style rally in his office. He invited a crowd of abortion foes. And GOP House members helped fill the room.Parson demanded the Democrats relent, allowing the legislation to come to a vote. Sen. Bob Onder, R-Lake Saint Louis, urged GOP leadership to stop negotiating with the Democrats.Onder is one of the leaders of the so-called Senate Conservative Caucus, a six-member cohort that has acted as a thorn in the side of Parson and President Pro Tem Dave Schatz all legislative session.
“Stop by leadership’s office,” Onder told the crowd. “Tell them: Get this bill to a vote. Don’t dilute it. Don’t gut it. Every piece in this bill is important.”About 5:50 p.m., when asked whether the two sides had a deal, Sen. Gina Walsh, D-Bellefontaine Neighbors, said, “No, we do not”At 7:55 p.m., Onder sent out an “EMERGENCY ACTION ALERT” to supporters.“We can’t let them weaken, dilute or ALTOGETHER GUT the bill, CAN WE?” the email said. He urged supporters to contact Senate Majority Leader Caleb Rowden, R-Columbia, and Schatz “and ask them to bring this bill to the floor NOW, not WEAKENED, NOT DILUTED, NOT ALTOGETHER GUTTED!”At 9:30 p.m., the conservatives held a news conference expressing the same sentiment. Negotiations between Republicans and Democrats continued.
Sometime overnight, Schatz, R-Sullivan, emerged from his office and spotted Bev Ehlen, an anti-abortion activist who had posted online the cellphone numbers of Schatz and Rowden that evening.“Never come to my office,” Schatz angrily told Ehlen as he breezed by, according to the account of a Kansas City Star reporter.“Take it like a man,” Ehlen called out to Schatz.Schatz, according to the report, turned around and got in her face: “That is so amateur for you to put my cell number out there.”Talks continued. Shortly before 12:30 a.m., Sen. Jamilah Nasheed, D-St. Louis, was filmed doing push-ups against a brass water fountain on the third floor of the Capitol. She was waiting.Shortly before 4 a.m., the Senate reconvened, and Republicans pushed the bill through. Democrats won small concessions, they said.After negotiations, Democrats allowed a vote on the bill, and they all voted “no.”To keep filibustering would likely have meant forcing Republicans to resort to a “nuclear” option — moving to call the previous question — which could have triggered a melt down, with Democrats using procedural maneuvers to stall progress on all legislation.Onder expressed displeasure at the concessions, but GOP Senate leadership declared victory.“We all collectively stand as one to protect the unborn,” Rowden said, choking up. “It’s a subject we care deeply about.”The legislation is House Bill 126.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Nathan's Law, designed to crack down on dangerous day cares, headed to Missouri governor","May 17, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/nathan-s-law-designed-to-crack-down-on-dangerous-day/article_6a2faae9-fe17-5d67-bee0-80b67f9ccd81.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — A St. Louis County lawmaker’s proposal to crack down on unlicensed day cares is headed to Gov. Mike Parson’s desk, the result of years of advocacy and a Post-Dispatch investigation that exposed Missouri’s lax regulations of in-home day cares.“Nathan’s Law” was inspired by Nathan Blecha, who died in 2007 after suffocating at an unlicensed day care in Jefferson County. He was 3 months old. His caretaker, Nathan’s mother found, was taking care of 10 children at the time, four of whom were her grandchildren.The Post-Dispatch, as part of its Deadly Day Cares series, published an article about Nathan on Oct. 10, 2011.

Currently, in-home day cares may serve four children, but caretakers may watch an unlimited number of relatives — a loophole that poses risks as caregivers are spread too thin.Nathan’s Law, sponsored by Sen. Jill Schupp, D-Creve Coeur, would limit the total number of children allowed at a home day care to six.The bill would exempt only children living “in the caregiver’s home who are eligible for enrollment in a public kindergarten, elementary, or high school” from being counted toward the six-child limit.Caretakers also would be allowed to care for no more than three children younger than age 2.Anyone who violates Nathan’s Law would be guilty of a Class C misdemeanor and would be subject to a maximum fine of $750.Missouri law now says a person who violates the current limits is guilty of an “infraction” and shall be fined up to $200.
Subsequent offenses under Nathan’s Law carry a $2,000-per-day fine.Subsequent violators would be guilty of a Class A misdemeanor, which carries a maximum one-year prison sentence, the same as penalties under current law.“It has real teeth to encourage prosecutors to prosecute when there are problems,” Schupp said. “It also gives the Department of Social Services the ability to go in and prosecute if the local prosecutor will not.
“And it raises the fines and fees, so it’s really going to discourage people from watching too many kids and putting their lives in danger,” Schupp said. Deadly Day Cares: A special reportSchupp said she had filed Nathan’s Law for 11 years, and credited former Post-Dispatch reporter Nancy Cambria with exposing the problem of unregulated day cares in Missouri.“She worked diligently to get background information, to get stories, to get information from coroners and share that with me over the years,” Schupp said. “And now all of that work, for all of these years, has come to fruition.”Schupp said that Parson, a Republican, had also supported her efforts this year.Nathan’s Law was included in House Bill 397, a wide-reaching proposal dealing with topics related to child welfare.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Up next for Missouri lawmakers: outlawing vast majority of abortions,"May 16, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/up-next-for-missouri-lawmakers-outlawing-vast-majority-of-abortions/article_3a440a53-e931-52d9-82c0-0f295abfa301.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — Inspired by President Donald Trump’s moves to shape a more conservative U.S. Supreme Court, Missouri Republicans raced the clock to join a parade of other states seeking to overturn the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized abortion.Facing a 6 p.m. Friday adjournment deadline and a deep desire by Democrats to block the sweeping legislation, senators worked overnight on a package of changes that would ban the vast majority of abortions in Missouri.Shortly before 4 a.m. Thursday, the GOP-led Senate approved a version of a sweeping abortion bill that the House had approved months earlier. The measure will need another vote in the House before heading to Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican, who is expected to sign the legislation.

""We all collectively stand as one to protect the unborn,"" Senate Majority Leader Caleb Rowden, R-Columbia, said after the vote, which fell along party lines, 24-10. ""It's a subject we care deeply about.""

 Although Missouri already is one of the more restrictive states when it comes to access to abortion, the latest push by the Republican-controlled Legislature comes amid a nationwide effort by abortion foes to get anti-abortion laws on the books that could be upheld by the newly revamped high court.At a campaign-style rally in his office, Parson on Wednesday evening urged the Senate to approve the package.“We have the opportunity to be one of the strongest pro-life states in the country,” Parson said. “It’s a God-given right to live. That’s why we’re here today, to protect people who don’t have a voice.”Democrats held court on the Senate floor for much of the day, stopping other work and criticizing the legislation and working to try to ease some of its harsher provisions.“I would characterize this legislation as extreme,” said Sen. Lauren Arthur, D-Kansas City. “I think this legislation will be struck down as unconstitutional.”“This is an unconscionable use of our power as a legislature,” added Sen. Jill Schupp, D-Creve Coeur.Under the House's version, sponsored by Rep. Nick Schroer, R-O’Fallon, and handled in the Senate by Sen. Bob Onder, R-Lake Saint Louis, abortions would be banned if a fetal heartbeat can be detected. It would also make abortion illegal in Missouri if the Supreme Court strikes down Roe v. Wade.Specifically, the measure would require providers to check for a fetal heartbeat before performing abortions or pay a $1,000 fine and face a potential loss or revocation of a physicians’ medical license.The provision is similar to “heartbeat” laws put on the books in Mississippi, Kentucky, Ohio and Georgia that ban abortion once a fetal heartbeat is detected. That can occur in about the sixth week of pregnancy.Kentucky’s six-week ban was challenged after it was signed in March, and a federal judge temporarily blocked it. Similar versions of the law have been struck down in North Dakota and Iowa.If the heartbeat provision is struck down, the bill calls for abortions at the “pain capable gestational age,” or about 20 weeks after fertilization, to be prohibited.The Missouri proposal also includes a requirement that both parents be notified if a minor seeks an abortion. And, Republicans tacked on a provision barring abortions from being performed solely because the fetus has Down syndrome.The measure says an abortion can be performed in “cases of medical emergency,” which is defined as “a condition which, based on reasonable medical judgment, so complicates the medical condition of a pregnant woman as to necessitate the immediate abortion of her pregnancy to avert the death of the pregnant woman or for which a delay will create a serious risk of substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function of the pregnant woman.”House Speaker Elijah Haahr, R-Springfield, told reporters the measure is not designed to draw a court challenge.
Rather, he said, “This is the type of legislation designed to withstand a challenge.”Rep. Mary Elizabeth Coleman, R-Arnold, said abortion was one of the primary reasons she ran for office last year.“We want to make abortion not only illegal, but unthinkable,” Coleman said.Sen. Jamilah Nasheed, D-St. Louis, blasted the Republican reaction to Trump’s attempt to swing the balance of the court to the conservative side.“They are pandering to this goofball,” Nasheed said. “He’s dangerous.”The abortion measure was approved in the House in February on a 117-39 vote.Opponents said abortion laws should be left alone in order to allow women to decide what’s best for their lives.
Schupp outlined several problematic provisions within the measure, but said one was particularly troubling.“There was no exception for a pregnancy caused by rape or incest,” Schupp said.“This is a massive blow to the reproductive rights of women in the state of Missouri. Everyone should be appalled by that,” Nasheed said.St. Louis has the only clinic able to offer abortions in the state. Last year, there were 2,911 abortions performed in Missouri, down from 3,903 in 2017, according to the Department of Health and Senior Services.M’Evie Mead, director of Planned Parenthood Advocates of Missouri, called the legislation an attack on health care.“The state of health care in Missouri is abysmal. Gov. Parson is willfully aiding in the systematic downturn of health outcomes across our state, and banning safe, legal abortion is just the latest effort,” Mead said.But, said Onder, “There is still more work to do.”After hours of closed-door meetings late Wednesday, Senate President Pro Tem Dave Schatz, R-Sullivan, was unwilling to say whether a deal had been struck to move forward with a vote.But, Sen. Bill Eigel, R-Weldon Spring, suggested the Senate could return to action as early as 11:30 p.m. to resume debate, but 11:30 came and went without movement.The Senate eventually convened after 3 a.m. Thursday and had approved the bill within the hour.The legislation is House Bill 126.Jack Suntrup of the Post-Dispatch contributed to this report.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Lawmakers approve plan to shine more light on how Missouri draws its political maps,"May 16, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/lawmakers-approve-plan-to-shine-more-light-on-how-missouri/article_662a4cf1-2c97-5c7d-a5c0-81b5d9d288cb.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — Missourians could get the chance to weigh in on the state’s redistricting process under legislation heading to Gov. Mike Parson’s desk.Voters approved Amendment 1, known as Clean Missouri, in November, which altered how Missouri’s political maps will be drawn.A nonpartisan state demographer will lead the redistricting effort for state legislative seats prior to the November 2022 elections. The end result could be more Democrats serving in the Republican-dominated Legislature.

Legislation by Sen. Dan Hegeman, R-Cosby, and Rep. Curtis Trent, R-Springfield, would require the demographer to create an online portal for public commentary. The provisions do not alter Clean Missouri itself. ""Hopefully it will make the process stronger,"" Trent said.The measure was approved in the House Thursday on a 142-3 vote.
People submitting comments would be required to disclose whether anyone funded their submission, and who cut the check. Auditor Nicole Galloway, the only Democrat holding statewide office, is in charge of the demographer application process. She will submit the names of at least three candidates to the Senate majority and minority leaders.
The state's current system of once-every-decade redistricting involves bipartisan commissions of political appointees who carve up the state's legislative districts.Republicans have sought to weaken a separate part of Clean Missouri that subjects lawmakers to the Sunshine Law. They also have attempted to undo the redistricting changes.But, those efforts have stalled in the waning days of the spring session.The legislation is Senate Bill 213.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Medical pot lobbyist co-hosting high-dollar fundraiser for Gov. Mike Parson next week,"May 16, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/medical-pot-lobbyist-co-hosting-high-dollar-fundraiser-for-gov/article_bc906233-8b0f-5fd3-a7e6-84a4cdfc7b46.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — Steve Tilley, lobbyist for the Missouri Medical Cannabis Trade Association, is co-hosting a high-dollar fundraiser for Gov. Mike Parson next week, according to a copy of an invitation obtained by the Post-Dispatch.Guests are asked to spend between $2,600 and $25,000 at the fundraiser, with money going toward Parson's campaign committee and its sister political action committee, Uniting Missouri, which does not have to adhere to campaign contribution limits imposed after a 2016 ballot initiative.The fundraiser comes as Missouri officials are finalizing rules for the state's fledgling medical marijuana program, which is scheduled to launch next year.

In addition to representing the medical pot trade group, Tilley also  represents Florida-based BiotrackTHC, a marijuana products software company seeking a state contract to help Missouri run the medical marijuana program. The company did not win a potentially lucrative state contract, and its attorney has filed a challenge to the decision with the state that as of last week was unresolved.""We have a very broad cross-section of supporters who contribute,"" said John Hancock, chairman of Uniting Missouri. ""The governor really is not very involved in the fundraising and solicitations at all.""Hancock said the identities of all donors are disclosed.""My job with the PAC is to raise money,"" he said. ""We are raising money and every nickel we raise is disclosed.""Missouri voters legalized medical marijuana in November, starting a stampede of business owners looking to capitalize on the new market.By 2025, sales of the various forms of the product are expected to top $100 million.Under the new law, the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services is required to grant at least 24 dispensary licenses in each of Missouri’s eight congressional districts, for a total of 192.The law also calls for the state to license 60 growers and 86 processing facilities.The complete list of applicants is not known because the state will not release their names. The Post-Dispatch has filed a lawsuit alleging the state is violating the Sunshine Law.Officials have said the text of a constitutional amendment authorizing the program precludes them from doing so, but one of the men who pushed for the amendment has said backers never intended for the names of applicants to be kept secret.Tilley’s involvement in the fundraiser comes after Parson collected at least $15,000 in campaign contributions from a separate consortium involved in the state’s burgeoning medical marijuana business.
The contributions to Parson’s Uniting Missouri PAC came on March 4. They include $5,000 from Blonie Dudney, a St. Louis eye doctor who is heading a newly formed medical marijuana company called Artemis Therapeutics.The other $5,000 contributions are from JoAnn’s Greenhouse, a Perryville retail plant grower and distributor, and Richard Buchheit, the son of the greenhouse owners, where Dudney wants to open his growing facility if he wins a license.Tilley, who is also a former Missouri House speaker, is not the only host of the fundraiser.Others include Sterling Bank of Poplar Bluff, which is involved in the state's low-income housing tax credit program that former Gov. Eric Greitens helped freeze in late 2017.
Greitens' exit led to Parson's elevation to governor from his former post as lieutenant governor.John Bardgett, of John Bardgett & Associates, is also listed as a co-host. That company has had to respond to pay-to-play allegations regarding a contract it won to lobby for the St. Louis Economic Development Partnership.The contract was mentioned in the indictment of former St. Louis County Executive Steve Stenger last month.In a statement, John Bardgett said his firm had worked for 31 years with St. Louis County and its economic development organizations.“This has occurred through the administrations of 5 county executives of different party affiliations — we do not, have not and never will place any conditions on any contribution to any organization,” he said in an email last month regarding the Stenger indictment.Michael Hafner, a former campaign adviser to former Gov. Eric Greitens, who eventually testified against the governor in a campaign finance scandal, is listed as a coordinator for the fundraiser on the invitation.""I haven't been working with Parson or his team up until a month and a half ago or two months ago,"" he said. ""They approached me because they needed help coordinating fundraising.""He said he is a long-time political consultant who has worked for several candidates. Hafner said he is still paying off legal bills stemming from the Greitens scandal.""I've had a role in these high-level races for literally my entire career,"" he said.The fundraiser is scheduled for next Tuesday evening at the Dean Team Automotive Group location in Maplewood, 7700 Manchester Road.
