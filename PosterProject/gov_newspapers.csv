Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Editorial: Nothing says 'pro-life' like prosecuting the victim for being shot while pregnant,"Jul 1, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-nothing-says-pro-life-like-prosecuting-the-victim-for/article_e73e9589-d39f-5d1a-8294-4507c0380218.html,"It was only a matter of time before the national debate over fetal rights and abortion would lead to this: A woman in Alabama has been charged with manslaughter for allegedly being involved in an argument in December that ended when another woman shot her in the stomach. The victim was five months pregnant and lost her baby. The shooter has walked free.The charges, filed last week, focus new scrutiny on Alabama over a new law that treats doctors who perform abortions as Class A felons subject to potential life imprisonment. The law bans abortions at any stage of pregnancy. Missouri Gov. Mike Parson signed a law in May criminalizing abortions beyond eight weeks of pregnancy, with doctors subject to between five and 15 years of imprisonment.Although women who seek abortions aren’t subject to prosecution under the new Alabama law, existing law defines “an unborn child in utero at any stage of development, regardless of viability as a person and human being for purposes of the state laws dealing with murder, manslaughter, criminally negligent homicide, and assault.”

Against that backdrop, some zealous prosecutors and law enforcers undoubtedly feel they have a green light to determine motive and culpability when a pregnant woman is involved in situations that endanger the life of her fetus. Women are at increasing risk of becoming legally defined as mere reproductive vessels, with their own rights becoming subservient to those of the unborn.Details of the Alabama case are not entirely clear. Marshae Jones, 27, of Birmingham, was five months pregnant when she got into an argument with Ebony Jemison, 23, regarding the unborn baby’s father. Jemison told BuzzFeed News that she tried to get away when the argument became too heated, but Jones allegedly persisted. Jemison got into her own car, grabbed a gun and shot Jones in the stomach.
“The investigation showed that the only true victim in this was the unborn baby,” the website AL.com quoted Pleasant Grove, Ala., police Lt. Danny Reid as saying in December. He added ominously: “It was the mother of the child who initiated and continued the fight, which resulted in the death of her own unborn baby.”
Jemison was originally charged with manslaughter in December, but a grand jury declined to indict her. The grand jury later indicted Jones.It’s a patently ludicrous case. Prosecutors effectively must argue in court that Jemison had no other choice than to shoot Jones, though no life-threatening conditions appeared to exist. Far more difficult will be proving that Jones knew she would be shot if she persisted in confronting Jemison.The case opens vast new avenues for prosecutors to go after pregnant women who smoke, drink, jaywalk, jog or even travel in a car that later is involved in an accident. This is exactly where “pro-life” zealotry is leading."
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Order allows abortions at Planned Parenthood clinic in St. Louis until at least Aug. 1,"Jun 28, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/order-allows-abortions-at-planned-parenthood-clinic-in-st-louis/article_f9024fb2-5dc1-570c-8627-3f2ed91bf430.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — The Missouri Administrative Hearing Commission on Friday issued an order allowing Planned Parenthood to continue performing abortions at its Reproductive Health Services clinic in St. Louis for the foreseeable future.Commissioner Sreenivasa Rao Dandamudi granted Planned Parenthood’s motion for a stay, which will allow abortions to continue at least until he hears the case later this year. The next administrative hearing is scheduled for Aug. 1.Planned Parenthood “has an active license that shall remain in effect for the pendency of RHS’ (Reproductive Health Services’) case at the Commission,” he wrote.

The order represents a victory for Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region and Southwest Missouri, which is seeking to continue abortion services in St. Louis despite action from the state Department of Health and Senior Services, or DHSS. The state is seeking to stop abortions there over concerns about patient safety.“We are relieved to have this last-minute reprieve, which means patients can continue accessing safe, legal abortion at Planned Parenthood in St. Louis for the time being,” Dr. Colleen McNicholas, a clinic obstetrician/gynecologist, said in a statement. “This has been a week-to-week fight for our patients and every Missourian who needs access to abortion care.”

On June 21, the DHSS denied Planned Parenthood’s application to continue abortion services at its clinic on Forest Park Avenue, citing a series of deficiencies there.But, the clinic was allowed to continue abortion services through Friday because of an order issued last week by St. Louis Circuit Judge Michael Stelzer. In his order, Stelzer said the state Administrative Hearing Commission, or AHC, which handles bureaucratic disputes, should review the case.Dr. Randall Williams, DHSS director, on Friday referred questions about the case to the attorney general’s office.“We’re currently reviewing the AHC’s decision closely to determine next steps,” said Chris Nuelle, spokesman for Attorney General Eric Schmitt, a Republican.McNicholas said the biggest effects from Friday’s decision will be on the St. Louis clinic’s patients. During weeks of legal uncertainty, staff employees had to call women each day to tell them whether their appointments would stand.McNicholas was in the St. Louis clinic Friday when news of the decision was announced to clinic staff.“There were cheers and even some tears,” she said, adding that the decision is “a brief moment of celebration, but now back to work both for our patients and the larger cause.”In a filing earlier this week, Planned Parenthood attorneys argued the hearing commission should order the state to renew the clinic’s license.
“Petitioner affirmatively states that its renewal application was complete and that all of the applicable requirements for licensure have been met,” attorney Charles W. Hatfield wrote in a complaint filed Monday night. “Nothing in Missouri’s statutory or regulatory scheme provides any basis or justification for Respondent’s asserted grounds for license denial.”The state filed a brief in response denying the clinic’s claim that its action to deny the license was “arbitrary and capricious.”In denying Planned Parenthood’s license, Missouri cited inadequately supervised pelvic exams, failed surgical and medication abortions, untimely reporting of those failed procedures and poor communication with a contracted laboratory.The attorney general’s office argued the license denial was justified in part because Planned Parenthood had not made available five physicians whom the state wanted to interview concerning patients who had suffered complications.
“It is not arbitrary or capricious for the Department to request interviews with treating physicians in an investigation,” the state said in response to Planned Parenthood’s motion. “And it is not arbitrary or capricious for the Department to infer from the noncooperation of RHS and its physicians that they lack satisfactory explanations for their conduct,” the state said.Dandamudi, ruling on behalf of the entire four-member commission, wrote that the DHSS’ argument that it had to deny the license because it could not interview the physicians was “unpersuasive.”Because of Missouri law, according to DHSS, “it must deny RHS’ application because it cannot determine RHS complied with applicable statutes and regulations without the interviews it seeks. At this point, we find DHSS’ position unpersuasive,” the commission said.“Our review of the applicable statutes and rules finds no provision that affirmatively provides an obligation for DHSS to make, or RHS to procure, such interviews,” the commission said.The commission said the DHSS had cited other reasons for denying Planned Parenthood’s license, but that the crux of the health department’s justification in denying the license relied on the lack of physician interviews.“The absence of these interviews in itself does not constitute a failure to comply with licensure requirements,” the commission said.If the state ultimately succeeds in ending abortion services at the St. Louis clinic, Missouri would be the first state since the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, which legalized abortion nationwide, to not have at least one abortion clinic.Reproductive Health Services is the only clinic providing abortion services in operation in Missouri.Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican, last month signed a strict anti-abortion law that will ban the procedure at eight weeks of pregnancy, except in medical emergencies. The law takes effect Aug. 28.Erin Heffernan of the Post-Dispatch contributed to this report.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,St. Louis congressman pushes bill to allow cities to pass their own gun laws,"Jun 28, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/st-louis-congressman-pushes-bill-to-allow-cities-to-pass/article_654dead3-3082-5a27-878e-26748e83ca23.html,"ST. LOUIS — U.S. Rep. William Lacy Clay, D-University City, announced a federal bill Friday that would allow local governments, including St. Louis, to pass stricter gun laws without approval from a state legislature.Clay announced the effort at St. Louis Children’s Hospital, which treats more gunshot wounds than almost any children’s hospital in the country. He was joined by St. Louis Mayor Lyda Krewson, city Public Safety Director Jimmie Edwards and local hospital and nonprofit leaders.The bill is the latest effort to address gun violence, what the mayor calls one of the city’s most critical issues, and comes after several unusually violent weeks in St. Louis that saw five children or teens killed by gunshot wounds in the city this June.

Clay’s bill — H.R. 3435, the Local Public Health and Safety Protection Act — attempts to address the problem by forcing states to allow local governments to pass their own gun laws, even if they are stricter than state laws. Any state that receives federal public safety funding would need to comply.“I’m tired of the violence,” Clay said at the Friday press conference. “I’m tired of the excuses. And I’m tired of our state Legislature being unable or just too frightened to do something about gun violence.”Cities in 43 states, including Missouri, are prohibited from enacting their own gun laws by state statute today, Clay said. He argued the legislation is needed in cities like St. Louis, which has for years been ranked among the most violent cities in America.“Unless we get control of the flow of unrestricted guns into our community, we are not going to solve this problem,” he said.The legislation has 20 co-sponsors in the U.S. House, but faces dim prospects of becoming federal law any time soon. It would need approval from the Republican-controlled U.S. Senate that, according to Clay, is “captive” to gun rights advocates at the National Rifle Association.Krewson said if the city got the power to write its own gun laws, her top priority would be to require a permit to carry a gun, reversing a vote by the Missouri Legislature to abolish the state’s concealed carry permits in 2016.“This has become so much more of a crisis in the last few years because Missouri no longer requires gun owners to carry a permit,” Krewson said after the news conference Friday. “So that’s the first step. So then if a law enforcement officer stops you with a gun they can ask, ‘Let me see your permit.’”
Edwards, the public safety director, said Friday that without local control over gun laws, the city’s police department has taken other routes to controlling the use of guns including referring more weapons cases to federal agencies and taking guns from minors through child safety laws.Gov. Mike Parson’s office did not respond to a request for comment on the legislation Friday. Statewide gun rights advocates at the Missouri Firearms Coalition argue the bill would overly restrict gun rights while doing little to curb the city’s violence.“There have been so many bills hyped as a magical cure to gun violence,” said Aaron Dorr, policy adviser for the Missouri Firearms Coalition. “And instead they are used to demonize and prosecute law-abiding gun owners and ignore the criminals that are actually committing the crimes.”Clay acknowledged Friday that city gun laws wouldn’t be a cure-all to the crime problem.
“This is a sliver of what we need, but at least it gives us another tool,” he said.But hospital leaders at the press conference Friday supported the bill, arguing they see the effects of the city’s gun violence firsthand.So far in 2019, more than 40 children have been treated at St. Louis Children’s Hospital with critical or fatal injuries from gunshot wounds, said the hospital’s chief medical officer, Alexis Elward.Medical professionals at the hospital routinely operate on toddlers riddled with bullets and treat children shot while walking to the bus stop or playing in the front yard, Elward said.“But there is nothing routine or natural about it,” Elward said. She added: “For the healthcare professionals here this is not political. This is not just professional. It’s intensely personal.”Jack Suntrup of the Post-Dispatch contributed to this report.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Controversy, complaints about secrecy have followed Missouri's top health official","Jun 27, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/controversy-complaints-about-secrecy-have-followed-missouri-s-top-health/article_35b45cb6-e0f1-5735-accd-ba4a5efcf3fd.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — Missouri’s top health official, a licensed obstetrician/gynecologist, is the face of the state’s effort to end abortions at the only clinic in Missouri that performs them.Dr. Randall Williams, a holdover from former Gov. Eric Greitens’ administration, is the expert Gov. Mike Parson leans on to explain why officials believe Planned Parenthood should be barred from terminating pregnancies at its Central West End clinic.The abortion issue has put Williams, director of the state’s Department of Health and Senior Services, front and center in a debate that coincides with Parson, a Republican, signing legislation last month that will prohibit women from terminating their pregnancies after eight weeks, except in medical emergencies.

Williams anticipated criticism when he took the job as state health director in 2017, he said in response to written questions from the Post-Dispatch.“Our job is to ensure the nearly 4,000 licensed health facilities are complying with current Missouri laws and regulations,” Williams said. “As for feedback, both positive and negative, I try to use it to help make us better at serving the people of Missouri.“I also remember an old adage from my many years in court as an expert witness: If the facts are on your side, argue the facts; and if the facts are not on your side, impugn people’s motives. So I am discerning in interpreting some people’s motives when they provide feedback.”Williams did not address his own views on abortion, saying only, “Abortion is legal in Missouri, and I want it to be safe.”He wasn’t always a bureaucrat. From 1989 until 2015 he was an obstetrician in private practice in Raleigh, North Carolina. In that role, he says, he delivered more than 2,000 babies.In 2011, Williams was a candidate for mayor of Raleigh, but came in last in the three-way, nonpartisan race. News reports at the time said Williams was a Republican who had supported President Barack Obama.After Patrick McCrory was elected governor of North Carolina in 2013, Williams served on his transition team for health care issues. In 2015, he was named health director in North Carolina.After two sometimes turbulent years, Williams came to Missouri in 2017 as Greitens assembled his cabinet.Since his arrival, Williams has been among the most high-profile agency directors, primarily because he has generated controversy as the head of a department that licenses health care facilities, tracks the spread of disease and is setting up the state’s medical marijuana program.

With the clamor over the new abortion law still reverberating, a St. Louis judge issued an order this month allowing Missouri’s only abortion clinic to remain open amid a battle over the facility’s license.That order expires on Friday, but meanwhile, Planned Parenthood has appealed the license denial to the state’s Administrative Hearing Commission, where the judge said the matter belonged.Planned Parenthood has asked the commission to allow it to continue abortions until at least Aug. 1, when the state and the clinic are scheduled to meet for a hearing.The dispute centers around the results of a two-month state investigation into Planned Parenthood’s St. Louis clinic. The state has outlined 30 deficiencies at the clinic, and it says the clinic has addressed a handful to the state’s satisfaction.The deficiencies cited included inadequately supervised pelvic exams, failed surgical and medication abortions, untimely reporting of those failed procedures and poor communication with a contracted laboratory.The state said some problems noted in the investigation caused “serious patient harm.”In response, Planned Parenthood officials accused Parson’s administration of politicizing state health regulations to restrict access to legal abortions in Missouri.Williams says politics have nothing to do with his department’s decision to revoke the license of the St. Louis clinic.“There is no influence that is exerted or accepted in those areas, whether it be from the governor or the Legislature,” he said.He also denied trying to discourage medication abortions by requiring pelvic exams before prescribing the pills. Planned Parenthood argues the exams are medically unnecessary in most cases, but Williams has said they are standard medical practice.Missouri residentWillams, 62, often wears a bow tie and likes to talk about running. According to his biography, he has run marathons in Boston, New York, Paris and Jerusalem, among other locations.He has kept a home in North Carolina, where his wife, Elizabeth Williams, still lives and works. In Jefferson City, he lives in an apartment near the Capitol. He said he votes and pays taxes in Missouri.Early in the morning, he often takes his dog Mo and sets off across the Missouri River bridge for a run. He says the Katy Trail is among his favorite places in Missouri.“I love my run in the morning,” Williams said.But his time in the capital city hasn’t always been tranquil.Williams has sparred with lawmakers on a number of occasions, including in July 2018 when House budget writers scolded him for bungling a program that helps get stroke and heart attack patients to the most appropriate facility in the shortest amount of time.
The dust-up came after Parson vetoed $153,000 from the program, setting off alarm bells that the program might be discontinued.Williams said the veto was a way to force hospitals to pay more to fund the program. He and Parson attempted to play down potential problems, arguing that their maneuver would not result in a break in service.Lawmakers said they were misled about the intent of the veto.Williams also was targeted by the House budget panel after he refused to release information about an outbreak of the tick-borne Bourbon virus.In blocking the release of information, Williams cited confidentiality laws. Lawmakers responded by cutting eight positions in his agency’s budget.Williams has been accused of being too secretive on other issues, as well.This year, Cole County Circuit Judge Patricia Joyce said the health department must release the results of lab tests related to 2017 protests in downtown St. Louis.The judge wrote that Williams’ agency violated open records laws when it refused to release lab tests of a liquid that St. Louis County police said was thrown at officers during protests, which were sparked by the acquittal of former police Officer Jason Stockley on a murder charge for the fatal shooting of Anthony Lamar Smith.The judge ordered the state to pay the ACLU of Missouri, which sought the records, $10,754 in fines and legal fees.The liquid was identified by police as apple cider vinegar.
Joyce’s ruling came two days after the Post-Dispatch filed a lawsuit against the agency for refusing to release records showing who is seeking to sell and grow medical marijuana in Missouri.The department says the constitutional amendment that legalized medical marijuana forbids the release of the records.Circuit Judge Daniel R. Green ruled in the Post-Dispatch’s favor last week.The department also eliminated geographic details from its reporting of West Nile virus cases, citing privacy concerns.“One of our agency’s top priorities is to follow the law and provide transparency and access to public information while using an abundance of caution to follow the law and protect confidential information,” Williams said.N.C. controversyThe controversies Williams has faced in Missouri were foreshadowed during his tenure in North Carolina.In 2016, the state’s toxicologist testified in a lawsuit that Williams and other environmental officials attempted to “play down the risk” of coal ash contamination of drinking wells by rescinding a do-not-drink notice.The toxicologist said in a deposition that the state was telling people the water was safe when it knew it wasn’t.Williams said he rescinded the warning notices because they were stirring up unwarranted fears.“And that there was a concern that we had alarmed people disproportionate to the risk,” he said in a deposition.The dispute led to the resignation of at least one state health official, who said she couldn’t support how Williams had downplayed the risks.Williams’ actions became an issue when he was being confirmed in the Missouri Senate.“After Flint, Michigan,” said Senate Majority Leader Gina Walsh, “I just want to make sure things like that don’t happen in my state,” referring to Flint’s problems with lead in its water supply. “Is it not your job to enforce your own rules?”Williams ultimately was confirmed unanimously by the Senate.When asked this week if he planned to continue on in Missouri, Williams said he would.“I love Missouri, my colleagues, and the opportunity to help people and serve our great state.”

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Missouri Auditor Galloway, planning run for governor, asks Gov. Mike Parson to combat ‘dark money’","Jun 27, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-auditor-galloway-planning-run-for-governor-asks-gov-mike/article_39070652-d42e-5d92-913e-efb1d943a7bb.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — Auditor Nicole Galloway on Thursday issued an open letter to Gov. Mike Parson pressuring the governor to address the influence of so-called dark money in state government.Galloway, a Democrat who is preparing to launch a campaign for governor, said Parson, a Republican, could take executive actions that would address the perception of pay-to-play politics by groups that do not have to reveal the sources of their donations.The letter was the latest effort by Galloway to differentiate herself from Parson, whom she would likely face in next year’s gubernatorial election if both decide to run as expected. Parson’s office did not respond to a request for comment.

“You could issue an executive order immediately to ensure transparency when it comes to the role of dark money in securing government contracts,” Galloway said, adding that she had proposed legislation that would act as a framework for such an executive order.Her legislation, she said, would require people or businesses entering into a state contract for $5,000 or more to disclose payments over $500 annually to 501(c)(4) nonprofits, which do not have to reveal donors.Galloway, 37, was appointed state auditor in 2015 and narrowly won a four-year term last November. That means she could run against Parson, 63, next year without sacrificing her statewide office if she lost.Her letter comes a year after she sent a similar letter to Parson, days after former Gov. Eric Greitens left office and Parson was sworn in. Greitens’ 501(c)(4) nonprofit, A New Missouri, raised $6.1 million in contributions in 2017, and the identities of the vast majority of the nonprofit’s donors remain secret.In her 2019 letter, Galloway cited Kingdom Principles, a 501(c)(4) nonprofit that tried to alter how colleges and universities handle sexual assault claims, as a reason Parson should address dark money.
“Media reports uncovered a trail of correspondence strategizing about this matter between lawmakers and a lobbyist who formed the dark money group behind the legislation,” Galloway said.She also suggested a measure pending on Parson’s desk would create “the conditions for public corruption” if signed into law by reducing the number of requests for proposals advertised by the state and ultimately making the bidding process less competitive.
Among the provisions of House Bill 1088, nicknamed by proponents the “Million Dollar Boondoggle Act,” is one that she argued would make the “potential use” of shortlisting “discretionary to all state contracts.”Shortlisting is a method used by state entities to limit the number of businesses eligible to compete in the bidding process.In the 2018 letter, Galloway asked Parson to “resolve the specter of dark money and secret donors influencing government.”She said the Legislature should pass a law requiring 501(c)(4) nonprofits — such as A New Missouri — to disclose donors. Lawmakers did not approve that legislation during the last legislative session.Parson’s allies have not launched a 501(c)(4) nonprofit of their own. Instead, the governor has raised money for his election through a political action committee that files paperwork with the Missouri Ethics Commission.Unlike a traditional campaign account, his Uniting Missouri PAC can accept unlimited donations. But unlike a 501(c)(4) nonprofit, Parson must reveal the source of every donation.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri Auditor Nicole Galloway 'very serious' about running for governor next year,"Jun 26, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-auditor-nicole-galloway-very-serious-about-running-for-governor/article_11fe4575-fa0e-59e4-a673-bcbc47f41db7.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — Missouri Auditor Nicole Galloway is planning to run for governor next year, the executive director of the Missouri Democratic Party told the Post-Dispatch.""She's very serious about the race and is taking steps to assemble a team and the resources it would take to win,"" said Lauren Gepford, executive director of the state Democrats, adding that she did not know when Galloway would make a formal announcement.Galloway, a Democrat, won a four-year term as auditor in November after being appointed to the post in 2015 by then-Gov. Jay Nixon, a Democrat. She narrowly defeated Republican Saundra McDowell last year, winning 50.4% of the vote. 

Galloway's pending entrance into the race presents a dilemma for state Sen. Scott Sifton, D-south St. Louis County, who said earlier this year he intended to run for governor. He declined to comment for this article.If both did run, the two would face off in an August 2020 primary, which Democratic insiders would like to avoid.Sifton reported having $313,000 in his campaign coffers as of April 1. Galloway had $65,798 in her account after raising $114,194 in the first quarter.Galloway, 37, of Columbia, would be the first woman elected governor in Missouri if she were to win in November 2020. She would have to defeat Gov. Mike Parson, 63, to win the office.Parson, a Republican, has more than $3 million in campaign funds spread across two separate accounts. Parson ascended to the state's top job one year ago after then-Gov. Eric Greitens, a Republican, resigned after months of scandal.Before Greitens' election in 2016, Democrats controlled most statewide offices in Jefferson City.But as of this year, Galloway was the only Democrat left holding statewide office in Missouri.In the last several months, she has made moves to differentiate herself from Parson.
During her inaugural address in January, Galloway criticized the Parson administration's Department of Revenue for secrecy concerning a tax withholding error that sent jitters through state government. During the speech, Parson was sitting feet from Galloway's podium.“The administration might have been trying to sweep this under the rug, but I will hold them accountable to you,” Galloway said in her address. “Missourians deserve transparency.”In May, she needled Parson's office for citing the First Amendment to close public records, and asked a Parson ally, Attorney General Eric Schmitt, to issue an opinion on the legality of such a citation. Schmitt has yet to issue one.
She also criticized a new anti-abortion law Parson signed last month, which bans the procedure at eight weeks of pregnancy. ""He wants a woman’s decisions over her health care to be criminalized,"" Galloway said. ""It’s extreme and cruel.""Jean Evans, executive director of the Missouri Republican Party, said it was no surprise Galloway was preparing a run for governor.""She's been attacking the governor for a while so we knew she was running,"" Evans said. ""It's not news. I mean, it is. But it's not to us.""President Donald Trump won Missouri in 2016 by 19 percentage points. That said, Missouri Democrats running for U.S. Senate and governor that year lost by more narrow margins.Still, Evans predicted Parson, who was elected lieutenant governor in 2016, would win a full four-year term as governor. She cited economic growth and the governor's stable hand as reasons voters would give him another four years in office.""It doesn't matter if it's Nicole, Scott Sifton, or anyone else ... I think the governor matches what people want in Missouri,"" she said.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Execution date set for Missouri death row inmate convicted of 1996 murder,"Jun 25, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/execution-date-set-for-missouri-death-row-inmate-convicted-of/article_8f2c5427-bed3-5df0-bdef-f5f976f8dcba.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — The Missouri Supreme Court on Tuesday issued a warrant of execution for Russell Bucklew, who was convicted of killing a southeast Missouri man in 1996 during a crime rampage.The state’s high court set Bucklew’s execution date for Oct. 1.

The warrant comes after the U.S. Supreme Court in April ruled against Bucklew’s bid to halt his death by lethal injection. Attorneys for Bucklew, now 51, argued his medical condition would lead to extreme suffering when put to death by lethal injection.Bucklew’s medical condition, cavernous hemangioma, causes weakened and malformed blood vessels, and tumors in his nose and throat could rupture and bleed.

“The Eighth Amendment has never been understood to guarantee a condemned inmate a painless death,” Justice Neil Gorsuch said in April. “That’s a luxury not guaranteed to many people, including most victims of capital crimes.”Bucklew’s execution has been delayed numerous times in the 22 years since he was convicted of first-degree murder.In 1997, a Boone County jury recommended the death penalty for Bucklew after convicting him of killing Michael Sanders, 27, the boyfriend of Bucklew’s ex-girlfriend.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,License dispute over Missouri's last abortion clinic heads to state commission,"Jun 25, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/license-dispute-over-missouri-s-last-abortion-clinic-heads-to/article_ca7814b5-cee2-5e07-9e54-ac6738684981.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — Attorneys for Missouri’s only abortion clinic have asked a state panel to reverse a decision by regulators that would stop legal abortions in the state.On Friday, the state Department of Health and Senior Services denied Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region’s application to continue abortion services at its Central West End clinic, citing a series of deficiencies there.The clinic is allowed to continue abortion services through Friday because of an order by St. Louis Circuit Judge Michael Stelzer. In his order, Stelzer said the state Administrative Hearing Commission, which handles bureaucratic disputes, should review the case.

Attorneys for Planned Parenthood have asked the commission to conduct a hearing on the dispute. They asked the commission to force the state to re-license the clinic.“Petitioner affirmatively states that its renewal application was complete and that all of the applicable requirements for licensure have been met,” attorney Charles W. Hatfield wrote in a complaint filed Monday night. “Nothing in Missouri’s statutory or regulatory scheme provides any basis or justification for Respondent’s asserted grounds for license denial.”The case has been assigned to Commissioner Sreenivasa Rao Dandamudi, and the commission has set a hearing for Aug. 1 in St. Louis.Because Planned Parenthood is only authorized to perform abortions through Friday, its attorneys asked Dandamudi for an order allowing it to continue providing abortions until the commission reviews the case.
He is one of three judges on the Administrative Hearing Commission and was appointed by then-Gov. Jay Nixon, a Democrat, in 2010.
Dandamudi has also served as an assistant attorney general for Missouri and has worked as general counsel for the state Board of Registration for the Healing Arts.The fight before the Administrative Hearing Commission is the latest development in a licensing dispute that has drawn national attention.If Planned Parenthood’s St. Louis clinic is forced to stop providing abortions, Missouri would be the first state since 1974 to have no abortion clinic in operation.Beyond the licensing dispute, Missouri lawmakers this year approved a sweeping anti-abortion proposal that bans the procedure, in most cases, at eight weeks of pregnancy.Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican, signed the measure last month. Most of its provisions take effect in August.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Editorial: State's traffic-stop racial disparities suggest much work remains to be done,"Jun 25, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-state-s-traffic-stop-racial-disparities-suggest-much-work/article_61401f6b-89c9-552a-8ca9-2f945494bade.html,"Missouri appears to be working hard to maintain its NAACP designation as a state perhaps best avoided. The state attorney general’s office this month released its assessment of 2018 traffic stops by local police, and the results are dismal: Black drivers are on average 91 percent more likely than white motorists to be pulled over.Attorney General Eric Schmitt made no attempt to sugarcoat the statistics, which local law enforcement agencies are required to report. The racial breakdown of drivers involved in traffic stops helps authorities keep tabs on police jurisdictions where bias might play a role in law enforcement decisions.An elevated number of traffic stops doesn’t always signify racial bias. For example, cities with overwhelmingly dominant black populations in theory should have a number of traffic stops skewed toward blacks. The same should hold true of white drivers in heavily white-dominated cities.

But that’s not how the numbers worked out. Particularly in the St. Louis area, blacks are being stopped far out of proportion to their representation in the population. In St. Louis city, blacks were subjected to traffic stops at a rate six times higher than their representation in the population and were 16.5 times more likely to be stopped than whites. That’s bad news for a city already immersed in controversy over reports of overt racism within police ranks.In Bellefontaine Neighbors, blacks were stopped nearly 8.6 times more than their numbers are represented in the population. Whites were stopped less than one-tenth of their ratio in the population.
Statewide, there were a total of 1.54 million traffic stops, with most — 1.18 million or 76.5% — involving white drivers. The statewide driving population is 82.8% white. Blacks represent only 10.9% of the driving population but represented 19.2% of traffic stops.
Roughly 6.6% of cars and/or drivers were searched. Blacks and Hispanics statewide were subjected to far higher rates of search. Interestingly, however, blacks and Hispanics were less likely than whites to have possessed illegal items than whites, the report says.Although the details in Schmitt’s report were exhaustive, there is still room for improvement. Including the time of day when a stop was made, for example, has helped other states identify specific police departments suspected of persistent racial harassment. That’s based on statistics indicating that traffic stops involving blacks are demonstrably higher during daylight hours, when officers can see the race of the driver, versus nighttime when lighting makes racial distinctions more difficult to detect.The NAACP issued a travel advisory on Missouri in 2017, citing in part the high disparity in traffic stops between blacks and white. Since then, the disparities have worsened. If Gov. Mike Parson truly cares about the state’s reputation and its ability to attract new business, he should make reversing these numbers a top priority."

Eric Greitens took $50,000 from an organization affiliated with Charles Koch, a Kansas businessman and GOP mega-donor.Tax filings made by The Seminar Network Chamber of Commerce Inc. show the group donated the money in 2017 to A New Missouri, the “dark-money” outfit formed by allies of Greitens early that year to promote Greitens’ conservative agenda and personal brand.A New Missouri raised $6.1 million in 2017, but the sources of the vast majority of that war chest remain shrouded in secrecy because the 501(c)(4) nonprofit does not have to reveal its donors.

Because of tax filings made by The Seminar Network and one other organization, some information about A New Missouri’s fundraising has been made public.The Center for Responsive Politics revealed in May that A New Missouri also accepted $500,000 from the Judicial Crisis Network, an organization that promotes conservative judges.The Seminar Network’s donation to A New Missouri represented a small portion of the network’s overall activities in 2017, the filing shows.According to its tax filing, The Seminar Network also gave $47.5 million to Americans for Prosperity, a 501(c)(4) group that supports Republicans and which doesn’t have to reveal its donors.The Seminar Network Chamber of Commerce said in its tax filing that it was formed to “advance its members’ common business interests by advancing the principles of free markets and a free society.”Mark Holden is listed as The Seminar Network’s president. He is also the senior vice president of Koch Industries Inc. and is chairman of Americans for Prosperity Foundation, according to its website.
A New Missouri filed its own tax return — known as a Form 990 — late last year, several months after Greitens, a Republican, resigned following months of scandal.A New Missouri’s filing confirmed the organization received enough money in 2017 to rival the campaign accounts of statewide candidates. It shows that money flowed to political consulting firms tied to Greitens and his campaign — reinforcing concern over close ties between Greitens’ campaign and the nonprofit.Unlike a traditional state campaign committee, A New Missouri was able to accept unlimited campaign donations and was able to shield its donors.
In July, at the culmination of a monthslong Missouri House investigation into Greitens’ campaign apparatus, then-state Rep. Jay Barnes, R-Jefferson City, wrote in a complaint to the Missouri Ethics Commission that A New Missouri was formed to evade state campaign contribution limits and donor disclosure requirements.Indeed, the 67 donations recorded in the 990 filing all exceed $2,600 — the cap voters in 2016 placed on individual donations to candidates.The ethics complaint is still pending, and the ethics committee’s proceedings are private, meaning little is known about how the agency is handling Barnes’ complaint.Greitens’ successor, Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican, has avoided raising so-called “dark money.” Instead, his allies have used the Uniting Missouri PAC to raise money for Parson’s election in 2020.While the political action committee does not have to adhere to donation limits set in 2016, it does have to disclose its donors under Missouri law.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri's only abortion clinic can keep license through Friday as it appeals to state commission,"Jun 25, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/missouri-s-only-abortion-clinic-can-keep-license-through-friday/article_4b92137e-1a6e-55d0-a398-75657d7abeaa.html,"ST. LOUIS — A judge’s ruling Monday extended Planned Parenthood’s St. Louis clinic license through Friday, allowing Missouri’s only abortion clinic time to appeal to a state commission.


            Judge Michael Stelzer's ruling in Planned Parenthood v MissouriSt. Louis Circuit Judge Michael Stelzer extended his June 10 preliminary injunction through 5 p.m. Friday to give the clinic time to challenge the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services’ decision to deny its license to the Administrative Hearing Commission.

“The Court has no authority to intercede in this matter until there has been a final decision by the AHC,” Stelzer’s ruling said.Stelzer’s ruling also dismissed other counts in the lawsuit, removing the case from state courts and ordering that it be taken up with the AHC. The panel handles licensing disputes between state agencies, businesses and people.Earlier this month, Gov. Mike Parson appointed a former judge to the AHC who has supported an anti-abortion pregnancy center.The Missouri Supreme Court in 2015 reprimanded former Macon County Associate Circuit Judge Philip Prewitt for encouraging people to donate to local charities on Facebook, including Ray of Hope Pregnancy Care Ministries, an anti-abortion nonprofit.Prewitt said he would consider recusing himself if requested by a party in the case.“I don’t see where it would be a conflict,” Prewitt said. “It doesn’t violate the judicial rules, so I don’t see how it would violate any commissioner rules either.”Parson spokesman Steele Shippy said the governor named Prewitt to the commission based on his experience as a judge and his past military service and that his stance on abortion was not a factor.The four commissioners work independently, and cases are assigned on a rotating basis.Dr. Colleen McNicholas, an obstetrician-gynecologist at the St. Louis clinic, said in a statement Monday that the “terrifying reality is that access is hanging on by a thread with a narrowing timeline. The truth is, if the Administrative Hearing Commission does not act by Friday, abortion access in the state of Missouri will be gone. This creates uncertainty for the patients we serve.”A health department spokeswoman declined to comment Monday.Planned Parenthood had not appealed to the AHC as of 5 p.m. Monday, records show.If the commission sides with the state, Missouri could become the first U.S. state without an abortion clinic since the Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade decision in 1973 established a woman’s right to terminate her pregnancy.
The state license only affects abortion services. The clinic also provides routine medical care to men and women, cancer screenings, sexually transmitted disease tests, permanent birth control procedures and counseling.The state denied Planned Parenthood’s license last week, citing deficiencies from an investigation of the clinic this spring.

            DHSS license denial letter to Planned Parenthood


            DHSS 'Emergency Amendment' to licensing regulations



            DHSS notice of deficiencies in Planned Parenthood lawsuitIn denying Planned Parenthood’s license, Missouri cited inadequately supervised pelvic exams, failed surgical and medication abortions, untimely reporting of those failed procedures and poor communication with a contracted laboratory.The state investigation found four instances of incomplete surgical abortions, which may have been hindered by patients’ obesity or uterine malformations. One of the patients also experienced a failed medication abortion, according to the state’s report.Incomplete abortions are a rare complication occurring in fewer than 1% of all procedures.Planned Parenthood officials have accused Gov. Mike Parson’s administration of politicizing health regulations to restrict access to legal abortions in Missouri.In a statement issued Friday, Parson said “Planned Parenthood is losing its license because it failed to meet basic standards of care.”Planned Parenthood sued the department last month claiming the state agency had illegally refused to renew the St. Louis abortion clinic’s annual license amid an investigation into the clinic. The state says Planned Parenthood has failed to comply with regulations by not compelling five doctors who have worked at the clinic to be interviewed.In May, Parson signed one of the nation’s strictest abortion laws, banning the procedures after the eighth week of pregnancy. Most of the provisions in that law take effect Aug. 28.The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Fate of Missouri's only abortion clinic in hands of judge after state denies license,"Jun 22, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/fate-of-missouri-s-only-abortion-clinic-in-hands-of/article_2fadbd35-596b-57e8-9573-c02ea662acdc.html,"ST. LOUIS — Planned Parenthood will continue providing abortions at least until a St. Louis judge issues a ruling in the clinic’s legal battle with the state Department of Health and Senior Services, which on Friday declined to renew the facility’s license.


            DHSS license denial letter to Planned ParenthoodCircuit Judge Michael Stelzer said in a brief court hearing Friday that despite the state’s decision, the abortion clinic’s license remains valid because of his June 10 preliminary injunction preserving the license. 

“Planned Parenthood’s doors remain open,” M’Evie Mead, director of Planned Parenthood Advocates of Missouri, said after the hearing. “The judge left his injunction in place, which means that Missourians can continue to access the full range of reproductive health care in Missouri for now.”The fate of the license now rests with Stelzer, who said he would issue a ruling soon.If the state’s denial stands, Missouri would become the first U.S. state without an abortion clinic since the Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade decision in 1973 established a woman’s right to terminate her pregnancy. The denial means Planned Parenthood can appeal to a state licensing commission.The state license only affects abortion services. The clinic also provides routine medical care to men and women, cancer screenings, sexually transmitted disease tests, permanent birth control procedures and counseling.Dr. Randall Williams, director of the Department of Health and Senior Services, said at a news conference Friday in Gov. Mike Parson’s office that politics played no role in the state’s decision to deny the license and that the clinic had not corrected more than two dozen deficiencies state inspectors had identified earlier this year.

A key point of contention has been the state’s requirement of pelvic exams prior to an abortion. The clinic said a recent state requirement had compelled physicians to perform two pelvic exams before an abortion — one 72 hours prior, and the second the same day of the abortion.The department, however, said pelvic exams must be completed 72 hours prior to an abortion because of the state’s informed consent law, which says doctors must identify risks to a patient three days before an abortion.On Friday, a Planned Parenthood spokeswoman said the St. Louis clinic a day earlier had stopped performing pelvic exams three days before an abortion, instead resuming its practice of doing exams on the same day of abortions.Williams said his agency had issued a regulation that would allow Planned Parenthood to conduct pelvic exams when it sees fit.“I am issuing an emergency rule today that Planned Parenthood can defer the pelvic exam until the day of the surgery if in their estimation — using their clinical judgment — that they think there’s a medical reason that they should do that,” Williams said. “We do not want patients having two pelvic exams.”

Lisa Cox, spokeswoman for DHSS, said the state had not required two pelvic exams prior to an abortion. She said the disagreement over the timing of the exam is what led to physicians performing two pelvic exams.“We’ve never required two,” she said.Missouri health officials had asked Stelzer to reconsider his order allowing Missouri’s only abortion clinic to remain open through Friday. Health officials also filed records of its two-month investigation into the clinic noting “at least 30 deficiencies” that the state says must be corrected before the clinic’s license can be renewed.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Judge says Missouri should open some medical marijuana records,"Jun 22, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/judge-says-missouri-should-open-some-medical-marijuana-records/article_c90773fd-ed1c-5fc5-aab4-719458b6b7c8.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — A Cole County judge on Friday sided with the Post-Dispatch in a lawsuit challenging the state’s ability to keep secret the identities of those seeking to sell medical marijuana in Missouri.Circuit Judge Daniel R. Green overruled the state’s motion to dismiss the Post-Dispatch’s lawsuit. He granted the newspaper’s motion for summary judgment to force the state to release the records.“I think that tie goes to the runner in a Sunshine Law case,” Green said on Friday.

The state does not have to immediately produce the records because Green delayed the effective date of his order so the state could decide whether to appeal.Dr. Randall Williams, director of the Department of Health and Senior Services, which regulates medical marijuana, said Friday afternoon he had yet to meet with his legal team to decide the state’s next steps.“It’s always our intent to comply with the law,” Williams said. “The judge ruled, and unless there’s some compelling reason from the attorney general’s office or our lawyers I would think we would provide that information as quickly as we can.”“In its oral ruling, the Court acknowledged that the case was a close one,” said Lisa Cox, spokeswoman for DHSS. “The Department cannot comment on how it will proceed until a final written order is entered and reviewed.”The Post-Dispatch sued the DHSS in January, accusing the state agency of violating the Sunshine Law by closing the applicant identifying information.The department said the text of the constitutional amendment legalizing medical marijuana precluded the state from releasing such information, but Joseph Martineau of Lewis Rice, an attorney for the Post-Dispatch, argued the state was relying on an “overly restrictive interpretation” of the amendment to close the records.The Missouri attorney general’s office moved to dismiss the case, while the Post-Dispatch filed a motion for summary judgment, seeking release of the records.The amendment voters approved in November says, in part, that the department “shall maintain the confidentiality of reports or other information obtained from an applicant or licensee containing any individualized data, information, or records related to the licensee or its operation … .”“(T)he provision does not say that the Department ‘shall maintain the confidentiality of the applicant or licensee‘ as well as the reports or other information obtained from the applicant or licensee,” Martineau wrote in the Post-Dispatch’s lawsuit.
Martineau wrote the state’s interpretation “is flawed, unsupported by the language of the provision, contrary to the provision’s intent, and disregards the important public policy that the process of applying for and awarding licenses to manufacture, distribute and dispense marijuana should be open and transparent.”State attorneys argued Green should apply a “traditional constitutional interpretation” to the constitutional clause that says the state should “maintain the confidentiality of … any information.”“The Post-Dispatch’s position is untenable and cannot be allowed to prevail over the will of Missouri voters and the plain language of the Constitutional provision they adopted overwhelmingly,” the state said.Missouri is required by law to approve at least 60 commercial growers, 86 facilities that manufacture marijuana-infused products and 192 dispensary licenses — 24 dispensaries for each of Missouri’s eight congressional districts.
As of late May, the state had collected $3.67 million in nonrefundable application fees from 510 pre-filed application forms, according to the state.The DHSS has said it will use a blind scoring process to assess the applications.Companies have also retained lobbyists as the application process intensifies.For example, Steven Tilley, former Missouri House speaker and a well-known lobbyist, has signed on numerous cannabis industry clients. He also lobbies for the Missouri Medical Cannabis Trade Association.He was scheduled to co-host a fundraiser last month for Gov. Mike Parson, who oversees the Department of Health and Senior Services.Because of the competition associated with the burgeoning industry, lawsuits could follow if the state rejects licenses.There has already been one dispute, between two companies seeking a state contract to help manage the state’s medical marijuana program. The state has rejected a protest by BioTrackTHC and has granted Metrc LLC the potentially lucrative contract.

LOUIS — A city alderman wants to tighten the city’s curfew for children under age 17 so that they’d have to be home by 10 p.m. Friday and Saturday nights and by 9:30 p.m. other nights.Under the current law on the books for decades, kids have to be inside by midnight Fridays and Saturdays and 11 p.m. the rest of the week.“That’s unacceptable,” Alderman Brandon Bosley, D-3rd Ward, said in an interview after introducing his bill on Friday.

“There’s no reason if you’re not an adult to be outside after hours when we’ve got all of these things going on in the city,” referring to violent crime.Bosley acknowledged that the current law isn’t enforced much. But he said he works closely with police in his north St. Louis ward and that the curfew tightening would be an additional tool in dealing with crime.If the bill passes, he said he’d work to make sure residents in his ward get a notice regarding the changes.
The bill also would end the curfew each day at 7 a.m., an hour and a half later than the current standard.As in the current law, exemptions would be made for kids returning home from school, work, a city-sponsored activity or a religious activity.
Exceptions also are provided for youths accompanied by a parent or someone over 21 years old authorized by a parent.Also Friday, Bosley said he’d soon send a letter to Gov. Mike Parson urging him to send in the Missouri National Guard or Missouri Highway Patrol to St. Louis to help undermanned police deal with violent crime.“Things have to change or they will get worse,” Bosley said.Bosley in April first made the call for the National Guard after a man was shot after a confrontation in an alley that started when the shooter wouldn’t move his car. The victim died at a hospital.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri's Republican attorney general amassing funds as he eyes 2020,"Jun 20, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-s-republican-attorney-general-amassing-funds-as-he-eyes/article_d8bbdb58-41c8-58ab-88f3-24f609812836.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — Just as Missouri Gov. Mike Parson is amassing a campaign war chest in anticipation of a run for a full term, the man he appointed attorney general also is ramping up fundraising heading toward 2020.Supporters of Republican Eric Schmitt of Glendale have raked in more than a half million dollars on his behalf, collecting cash from big money donors like retired St. Louis financier Rex Sinquefield, who wrote a check for $250,000 in February.At the helm of the fundraising efforts for the pro-Schmitt political action committee known as MO Opportunity PAC is Meredith Gibbons, who formerly raised millions of dollars for disgraced former Gov. Eric Greitens. Records show she is receiving $8,000 a month to fill the coffers.

The PAC snared a $100,000 check from Herzog Contracting, a St. Joseph-based construction services company run by Stanley Herzog. Herzog is a large donor to Republican causes. In 2016, for example, the company gave $650,000 to Greitens.Other big donors include August Busch III who gave $50,000 in May.As of April 1, the PAC had $147,000. However, that doesn’t count an additional $350,000 the PAC has in a certificate of deposit that comes due in September 2019.And, that doesn’t account for the money Schmitt has raised for his own personal campaign account. The latest reports show he has $415,000 in that account.For now, the only Democrat who has announced plans to run has just $13,930 in his campaign account.St. Louis attorney Elad Gross is a political newcomer who is hoping to return the seat to Democratic hands. Before 2017, the post had been held by Democrats dating to 1993.
Schmitt was appointed attorney general after fellow Republican Josh Hawley vacated the office to join the U.S. Senate. He earned his law degree from the St. Louis University School of Law in 2000. He served two terms in the state Senate representing parts of west St. Louis County, and was a partner at the Lathrop Gage law firm until being sworn in as treasurer in 2017.The two men serving as treasurer and deputy treasurer are Carl Struby and Jean Paul Bradshaw, both of whom are Lathrop Gage attorneys.Attempts to discuss the fund with them were unsuccessful.
The campaign fund is similar to one formed on behalf of Parson. Unlike their personal campaign accounts, which cannot receive contributions over $2,600, the separate campaign committees can take in unlimited contributions.Since Missouri voters enacted limits on campaign contributions in 2016, a growing number of candidates have set up political action committees that do not have to abide by those rules.But unlike Greitens’ use of a nonprofit to raise money, the names of donors and the amounts they contribute are publicly disclosed.During his 17 months in office, Greitens used the nonprofit group A New Missouri to promote his agenda.The use of the nonprofit, which also employed Gibbons, led to accusations that Greitens violated Missouri campaign finance law by intentionally concealing donors, and worries that his backers gained unfair influence within state government.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Ex-judge who supported anti-abortion pregnancy center will help decide fate of Missouri's only abortion clinic,"Jun 18, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/ex-judge-who-supported-anti-abortion-pregnancy-center-will-help/article_8cf62786-718f-5b54-8928-11a794b4e2cf.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — Gov. Mike Parson appointed a former judge who has supported an anti-abortion pregnancy center — and been disciplined for publicly doing so — to an administrative panel that could handle a licensing dispute with the state’s only abortion clinic.The Missouri Supreme Court in 2015 reprimanded former Macon County Associate Circuit Judge Philip Prewitt for encouraging people to donate to local charities on Facebook, including Ray of Hope Pregnancy Care Ministeries, an anti-abortion nonprofit.The Republican governor, an abortion opponent who last month signed into law one of the strictest abortion laws in the country, on June 3 appointed Prewitt to the Administrative Hearing Commission, a panel that handles disputes between state agencies and businesses or individuals.

Lawyers for the state have argued that the commission should adjudicate a dispute between the state’s only clinic performing abortions and the state health department, which is refusing to renew the clinic’s abortion license. The dispute is now in St. Louis circuit court.Prewitt has weighed in on abortion previously. He ran as a Republican for a state representative seat in 2000 and received a $250 campaign donation from Missouri Right to Life PAC. When he was serving as an associate judge in 2014, he supported Ray of Hope on his Facebook page.“I am happy to be supporting Ray of Hope Pregnancy Center again at their fundraising dinner,” the post read. “Even if you didn’t attend, consider donating to this wonderful organization.”Prewitt also posted about donating to a local cancer fundraiser and local schools.A state judicial oversight organization — the Missouri Commission on Retirement, Removal and Discipline — in 2015 found that Prewitt’s Facebook posts violated a state Supreme Court rule that bans judges from abusing the “prestige of office to advance the personal or economic interests ... of others,” including a rule that a judge may not “personally participate in the solicitation of funds or other fundraising activities.”The commission in court filings noted that Prewitt had no prior complaints against him, was “cooperative and truthful” during the investigation, and that in response he stopped the questionable Facebook posts.
Prewitt told the Associated Press on Monday that he doesn’t see a problem with the reprimand or his past support for the pregnancy care center and from Missouri Right to Life. He said he would consider recusing himself if requested by a party in the case.“I don’t see where it would be a conflict,” Prewitt said. “It doesn’t violate the judicial rules, so I don’t see how it would violate any commissioner rules either.”Parson spokesman Steele Shippy said the governor named Prewitt to the commission based on his experience as a judge and his past military service and that his stance on abortion was not a factor. He said the governor’s office was aware of Prewitt’s previous reprimand, but noted that the Supreme Court did not go further to suspend or revoke his license.
“Based on those qualifications, we believe that he would execute the responsibilities of commissioner appropriately,” Shippy said.Commissioners work individually, and Prewitt said cases are assigned on a rotating basis by a scheduling clerk. Three other commissioners currently serve on the panel and could also be assigned the abortion clinic case, if it ever makes it to the commission.Prewitt lost re-election in 2018 and in December resigned early. He said he applied for an open seat on the Administrative Hearing Commission several months ago and heard back around March.“Many months ago was I considered for the appointment, so this wasn’t even an issue when I was talking to the governor’s office about the appointment,” he said.Since he left his judgeship, Prewitt has continued to be active on Facebook. In February, he posted a photo of a truck with writing on the back that says: “What’s the difference between a gun and a whiny liberal? A gun has only one trigger. #buildwall.” He’s also shared memes about vegans, atheists and a post with a photo of a woman that says, “Why is she wearing leggings?”

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Planned Parenthood earns win in fight over funding in Missouri,"Jun 17, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/planned-parenthood-earns-win-in-fight-over-funding-in-missouri/article_ff1500dc-e4cc-51be-81d2-860b0965b5fd.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — A St. Louis judge has blocked Missouri’s Republican-led Legislature from cutting off funding to abortion providers and their affiliates.In a decision that adds another legal front to the courtroom battles already underway between a state government controlled by the GOP and affiliates of Planned Parenthood, Judge David Dowd said the attempted funding prohibition was constitutionally flawed and couldn’t be completely enforced.The ruling potentially protects health care options for an estimated 7,000 people.

The case stems from a 2018 initiative by lawmakers to block Medicaid funding from going to “any abortion facility” and “any affiliate or associate thereof.”It has become a common practice for lawmakers to use the budget to legislate policy initiatives. This year, for example, they used the maneuver to block college students with unlawful immigration status from receiving in-state tuition rates at Missouri universities.In the case of the abortion language, Planned Parenthood sued the state saying some of its chapters provide preventive health care, but not abortion, and should not be penalized.In his decision, Dowd wrote that “eligible individuals are allowed to choose the provider they wish to see and the state is required to pay for those services on behalf of the eligible individual.”It remains unclear whether a tweak in this year’s budget might allow the prohibition to stay intact in the new fiscal year beginning at the end of this month.In a statement, Gov. Mike Parson suggested the ruling would be appealed.
”Our office is still reviewing the court’s decision, however, we will always defend our position that no state taxpayer dollars should be used to fund abortion,” the statement noted.The ruling comes as the state and abortion rights advocates continue to fight on multiple issues.



            Planned Parenthood order
On Thursday, the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services filed a motion asking St. Louis Circuit Judge Michael Stelzer to withdraw his preliminary injunction extending the license for Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region.The state’s court filing also outlined results of a two-month investigation into the clinic and attached a letter highlighting “at least 30 deficient practices” the state says must be addressed before the clinic’s license can be renewed.Planned Parenthood officials accused Parson’s administration of politicizing state health regulations to restrict access to legal abortions in Missouri.A separate court fight is underway over attempts to put a question on the 2020 ballot asking if Missouri voters support a restrictive new law that prohibits abortion after the eighth week of pregnancy.That issue is pending at the appeals court level.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Editorial: New child-wellness numbers suggest 'pro-life' lawmakers are missing the mark,"Jun 17, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-new-child-wellness-numbers-suggest-pro-life-lawmakers-are/article_d009a3ef-dc2e-5a73-92a0-12d4c9d95151.html,"For state legislatures around the country, the latest “Kids Count” report by the Annie E. Casey Foundation offers some important guideposts on funding priorities to ensure fewer children aren’t forced to grow up in poverty with substandard health care and education. The report has lots of good news but also points to some persistent trouble spots.For Republican-dominated states like Missouri, the report’s findings serve as a stark warning: Despite claims of being “pro-life,” lawmakers fall seriously short when it comes to ensuring a quality existence for all children beyond the womb. Forced-birth laws such as the one passed by Missouri’s Legislature last month and signed by Gov. Mike Parson have been celebrated by abortion-rights opponents as a major victory. But lawmakers continue to shortchange children in terms of their education, health care and financial security.First some good news from the report: Nationwide, the percentage of children growing up in poverty dropped 4 percentage points between 2010 and 2017. Fewer parents lack secure employment, and fewer teens are listed as neither in school nor working. But today, more than 13 million children — about 18% of all children — still live in poverty, while more than a quarter of all parents lack secure employment.

In Missouri, 19% of kids are growing up in poverty, and 27% of parents lack secure employment. More Missouri children are growing up in single-parent households, but a smaller percentage are in families where the head of household lacks a high school diploma. Teen births also show a promising, sharp downward trend. But there’s been a sharp increase in child and teen deaths per 100,000 population.
The educational picture continues on a stubborn trajectory. Nationally and in Missouri, more than half of children ages 3 and 4 are not in school despite research pointing to improved educational outcomes when young children receive prekindergarten instruction. Missouri showed only slight improvement in the number of fourth graders not proficient in reading, dropping from 64% in 2009 to 63% in 2017.The percentage of Missouri eighth graders not proficient in math has worsened over the past 10 years. Two-thirds now rank as nonproficient. Nevertheless, nationally as well as in Missouri, the percentage of high school students graduating on time is on a dramatic upswing.
Missouri consistently ranks in the middle or among the bottom half of states in performance on overall child well-being, economic security, education and health. It shares those low rankings with Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, Arkansas and Louisiana — states where the most restrictive abortion laws in the country have recently been passed.These male-dominated legislatures claim to be fighting for children when they enact laws forcing women to give birth regardless of their emotional or financial preparedness for parenthood. But the latest Kids Count numbers expose the hypocrisy behind those “pro-life” claims."
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Voters said no to gas tax hike, so Missouri will start limited bridge replacement program","Jun 17, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/voters-said-no-to-gas-tax-hike-so-missouri-will/article_57aa47e2-9106-5112-a6be-f768a347eaf9.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — Missouri transportation officials are on track to begin replacing 40 bridges as part of a $350 million road improvement program approved by lawmakers and signed this week into law by Gov. Mike Parson.Most of the projects are small bridges in rural areas of the state.There are no bridges in St. Charles County on the list and only one is in St. Louis County. The work includes the replacement of the Ladue Road bridge that spans Hibler Creek in Creve Coeur. Work is scheduled to begin on that one later this fall.

Other nearby projects include the Missouri Highway 30 bridge over Saline Creek in Jefferson County and the Highway 79 bridge over McLean’s Branch near Winfield.Money to pay for the work is coming out of a $50 million fund set aside by lawmakers this spring as they attempted to craft a transportation improvement program without the aid of additional dollars from the state’s gasoline tax.The motor fuel tax typically pays for roadwork. But, in 2018, voters rejected a phased-in increase of 10 cents in the state’s 17-cents-per-gallon tax on gas.Parson, a Republican, had backed the tax hike as a way to address a growing backlog of road repairs facing the Missouri Department of Transportation.Without that additional revenue, he convinced lawmakers to allow MoDOT to sell $301 million in bonds to pay for repairs to 220 bridges across the state. But, as part of a deal with lawmakers reluctant to take out a loan for the work, the bonds will only be used if the state is awarded federal matching funds to replace the 59-year-old Interstate 70 bridge over the Missouri River near Rocheport.MoDOT Director Patrick McKenna said he believes Missouri has a good chance of receiving the grant because of the amount of commercial truck traffic plying I-70.
“It puts us in a hopeful position,” McKenna told the Post-Dispatch.The state could find out by September whether the federal dollars are coming for the estimated $350 million project.Missouri’s application calls for the state to pay $105.2 million, and Columbia and Boone County each would provide $2 million. The state also would receive a $73.1 million federal loan.
“It was a very aggressive application,” McKenna said.In January, the lack of bridges targeted for work in St. Charles County triggered outcry from the county’s two state senators, Republicans Bob Onder of Lake Saint Louis and Bill Eigel of Weldon Spring.Eigel said he took his concerns to Parson in hopes of addressing the absence of work in one of the state’s most populous counties.In making his pitch for the brige plan, Parson said the list of projects was not politically driven, because they were chosen by regional planning boards and then approved by the state Highways and Transportation Commission.After the first round of 40 bridges get underway, others the St. Louis region expected to be replaced include the $2.7 million replacement of a bridge over Happy Sac Creek in Franklin County and a $4.4 million replacement project at the intersection of Valley Dell Drive and Gravois Road in Jefferson County.Also on tap for work are the North Broadway bridge over Interstate 44 in St. Louis and the replacement of the Missouri Highway 47 bridge over Interstate 44 in St. Clair in Franklin County.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,State asks St. Louis judge to rescind order in abortion clinic's license fight,"Jun 13, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/state-asks-st-louis-judge-to-rescind-order-in-abortion/article_955ba38b-9676-5f0a-938f-54e3a354caa6.html,"ST. LOUIS — State health officials asked a St. Louis judge on Thursday to reconsider his order allowing Missouri’s only abortion clinic to remain open for now.The Department of Health and Senior Services filed a motion Thursday asking Circuit Judge Michael Stelzer to withdraw his preliminary injunction extending the license for Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region. The state’s court filing also outlined results of a two-month investigation into the clinic and attached a letter to the clinic, highlighting “at least 30 deficient practices” the state says must be addressed before the clinic’s license can be renewed.The deficiencies cited include inadequately supervised pelvic exams, failed surgical and medication abortions, untimely reporting of those failed procedures and poor communication with a contracted laboratory. The state said some problems noted in the investigation caused “serious patient harm.”

Planned Parenthood officials accused Gov. Mike Parson’s administration of politicizing state health regulations to restrict access to legal abortions in Missouri.“We’re reviewing the state’s latest political attempt to shut down the last legal abortion provider in Missouri,” Jesse Lawder, a spokesman for Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region, said in a statement Thursday. “From the start, Gov. Parson and DHSS Director Randall Williams have attempted to advance a political agenda, weaponizing the inspection process, and we have no reason to believe this is any different.”DHSS’ court filing Thursday is the latest response in Planned Parenthood’s lawsuit aimed at keeping Missouri from becoming the first U.S. state without an abortion clinic since the Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade decision in 1973 established a woman’s right to terminate her pregnancy.The state’s deficiencies list included a pelvic exam that failed to detect a problem with a woman’s uterus and led to two failed abortion attempts on her. The list also included a lack of an “informed consent” consultation with a woman who later went to the emergency room over complications from an abortion.In addition to its list of deficiencies, the state reiterated in its court brief that a state administrative commission — not a state court — is the proper place for Planned Parenthood’s license complaints. State officials asked Planned Parenthood to produce a correction plan by the end of Tuesday.Planned Parenthood sued the department last month claiming the state agency had illegally refused to renew the St. Louis abortion clinic’s yearly license until the state could complete an investigation. The state has argued that Planned Parenthood failed to comply with licensing regulations by not compelling five doctors who have worked at the clinic to be interviewed as part of the state’s investigation.Stelzer ruled Monday that DHSS must decide whether to renew Planned Parenthood’s license by June 21, the date of the next court hearing over the licensing lawsuit. Stelzer did not instruct the state how to rule, but said it had the exclusive authority to decide.
Planned Parenthood’s legal fight coincides with Parson last month signing one of the nation’s strictest abortion laws, banning the procedures after the eighth week of pregnancy.Other lawsuits
On Thursday, a Cole County judge tossed out one of a trio of lawsuits seeking to allow voters to decide the fate of the state’s new abortion restrictions.In dismissing the legal challenge by the American Civil Liberties Union of Missouri, Circuit Judge Daniel Green gave the organization a chance to pursue the case to a state appeals court, where the case was likely to end up anyway.The decision to dismiss the case came two days after Green set a hearing for Monday to discuss the challenge, as well as one funded by wealthy Republican campaign donor David Humphreys, who opposes the new law because it lacks protections for women who are raped or victims of incest.Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft, who signs off on proposed referendums, contends the ballot initiatives cannot go forward because part of the abortion law is already in effect.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"In rare move, Missouri governor to hand off power to No. 2 while on overseas vacation","Jun 13, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/in-rare-move-missouri-governor-to-hand-off-power-to/article_2cbc64fe-7dc5-597e-bced-b059c7f5b4e8.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — Missouri Gov. Mike Parson is taking steps to temporarily hand over power to the state’s No. 2 officeholder later this month when he travels to Europe for a trade mission and a vacation.Under a plan that is still taking shape, the Post-Dispatch has learned Parson is planning to cede his gubernatorial powers to fellow Republican Lt. Gov. Mike Kehoe during the vacation portion of his overseas trip from June 23 to July 2.The maneuver will allow Kehoe to sign legislation on Parson’s behalf, including a proposal that will transfer oversight of the Missouri Arts Council from the Department of Economic Development to the lieutenant governor’s office.

He also will have the ability to create a task force on food and beverage manufacturing in Missouri and appoint members to a Route 66 centennial commission.As acting governor, Kehoe won’t have the ability to pardon prisoners, commute sentences or many of the other powers given to the chief executive, administration officials said.Parson intends to resume his duties when he and first lady Teresa Parson return, officials said. Details of their vacation were not immediately available.The governor, who was appointed to the post June 1, 2018, after the resignation of scandal-plagued former Gov. Eric Greitens, is relying on a clause in the state constitution that allows the chief executive to grant his powers to the lieutenant governor.Under that provision, he must submit a letter to legislative leaders declaring he is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.Such moves are not common. But, Parson and Kehoe are from the same party and Parson appointed Kehoe to the No. 2 post after Parson took over as governor.The last time the event occurred was in 2005 when then-Gov. Matt Blunt ceded power to former Lt. Gov. Peter Kinder for a short period of time.In 2016, Kinder, a Republican, sent former Gov. Jay Nixon, a Democrat, a letter demanding Nixon grant him gubernatorial powers as Nixon was preparing to leave on an overseas trade mission.Kinder said the state needed a chief executive in the wake of violence against law enforcement officers, including a Ballwin police officer.
“I believe MO needs a leader with the authority to defend her,” Kinder said in a tweet at the time.Nixon cancelled the trip and did not address Kinder’s request.The rules governing who’s in charge when a governor is traveling vary from state to state.For example, a provision of North Carolina’s constitution automatically elevates the lieutenant to acting governor when the full-time chief executive is absent from the state.
A similar scenario has been in California law since 1849. It says a governor must be within the state borders to have the powers of the office.Parson departs for France Saturday as part of a trade mission to Europe that includes stops in Germany and Switzerland.In what will be his first overseas trip since taking off last year, the Republican will retrace the steps taken by his predecessors during a visit to the Paris Air Show.Nixon and Blunt also attended the air show to highlight Missouri’s aerospace industry, which includes Boeing Co. and its St. Louis-made F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jets.Greitens was scheduled to go in 2017, but canceled after he called lawmakers back to the Capitol for a special session.The air show is set to get underway on Monday.Costs of the official portion of the trip will be shared between state taxpayers and the Hawthorn Foundation, a public/private partnership created by then-Gov. Kit Bond to help fund gubernatorial travel expenses.Parson’s vacation will not be funded by taxpayers.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Abortion vote lawsuit dismissed, but efforts continue to let voters decide fate of law","Jun 13, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/abortion-vote-lawsuit-dismissed-but-efforts-continue-to-let-voters/article_5b3efaf5-acab-5d1c-b398-207a5f23cd91.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — A Cole County judge on Thursday tossed out one of a trio of lawsuits seeking to allow voters to decide the fate of the state’s new restrictions on abortion.In dismissing the legal challenged by the American Civil Liberties Union of Missouri, Circuit Judge Daniel Green gave the organization a chance to pursue the case to a state appeals court, where the case was likely to end up anyway.The decision to dismiss the case came two days after Green set a hearing Monday to discuss the challenge, as well as one funded by wealthy Republican campaign donor David Humphreys, who opposes the new law because it lacks protections for women who are raped or victims of incest.

Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft, who signs off on proposed referendums, contends the ballot initiatives cannot go forward because one part of the abortion law is already in effect.The new law bans doctors from terminating a woman’s pregnancy after the eighth week, except in medical emergencies.The law would ban abortion completely in Missouri if the Supreme Court overturns the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that made abortion legal throughout the United States.Those elements don’t go into effect until Aug. 28.But a provision requiring both parents to be notified of a planned abortion of a minor went into effect when Republican Gov. Mike Parson signed the legislation last month.ACLU attorney Tony Rothert told the Post-Dispatch Thursday that the group wanted Green to dismiss the case in order to keep the lawsuit moving in the court system.
Opponents of the law are working against an Aug. 28 deadline to collect 100,000 signatures to freeze the law until a vote can be held. But, the legality of the initiative must be determined first.Rothert wants the appeals court to put the case on a fast track.""We'll be asking for it to be expedited. We hope the appeal can be resolved in a couple of weeks,"" Rothert said.
Among the arguments the appellate court may hear is whether requiring two parent notification for minors is an actual emergency.""That could be part of the argument,"" Rothert said.Attorney Lowell Pearson, who is representing Humphreys, said the emergency clause prohibition on referendums doesn’t apply because only part of the bill, and not the entire measure, went into effect right away.Pearson and the ACLU also say that provision is not an actual emergency, citing statements by the bill’s sponsor that the insertion of an emergency clause was designed to block a referendum.The ACLU said the Legislature ""cannot tack an emergency law onto a non-emergency law in order to evade citizens' fundamental right of review on laws that fall unambiguously within the people's constitutional referendum power.""

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Editorial: Trump administration parts ways with ""pro-lifers"" on when life begins","Jun 12, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-trump-administration-parts-ways-with-pro-lifers-on-when/article_de14e21c-2b69-54ae-9a8e-d41bed1e891d.html,"Religious conservative lawmakers seem hellbent on prompting legal challenges to the abortion issue until the U.S. Supreme Court is forced to rethink its 1973 Roe v. Wade decision. They’d better be careful what they wish for.A new spate of abortion laws, including in Missouri, attempt to define embryonic life for the purpose of outlawing abortion, but they also force the question: At what point does life begin? The question has been asked philosophically countless times. But from a lawmaking standpoint, it remains as ill-defined today as ever. If Supreme Court justices pose this question, lawyers for the “pro-life” faction could have a nightmarish experience defending their answer.Lawmakers in Missouri and other states have attempted to legally define viability as the moment a fetal heartbeat can be detected, which typically occurs six to eight weeks from conception. Under a new law signed by Gov. Mike Parson, no abortions may legally occur after that, including for rape and incest victims, unless the mother’s life is in danger.

The detectable heartbeat defines the embryo as a living human being under these laws. Doctors who perform abortions after eight weeks of pregnancy can be held criminally responsible. Alabama would put them on trial for homicide.Supporters of such draconian laws credit President Donald Trump as their biggest champion for having tipped the Supreme Court’s conservative balance enough to overturn Roe. But in 1973, the court deliberately established a much more amorphous definition of when life begins.
“We need not resolve the difficult question of when life begins,” the Roe decision states. “When those trained in the respective disciplines of medicine, philosophy, and theology are unable to arrive at any consensus, the judiciary, at this point in the development of man’s knowledge, is not in a position to speculate as to the answer.”
The Trump administration might not turn out to be such a champion after all if the court looks at its record as a potential weather vane.On Feb. 22, a Honduran woman was under detention by Immigration and Customs Enforcement when she went into premature labor at 27 weeks of pregnancy. The baby was born dead, even though the mother had received two medical screenings during detention and was declared healthy.ICE nevertheless stated that this didn’t qualify as an “in-custody death,” which put the Trump administration on record as saying that, even at six months, a fetus in the womb doesn’t count as a life. Of course, ICE made that determination not out of consideration for future Supreme Court challenges but because it wanted to avoid adding to its already embarrassing death-under-detention statistics.In other words, when forced to choose, the Trump administration opted for political expediency. After 46 years of punting the question, the definition of life in the womb remains as much a political football as ever."

Suzie, however, may have to watch her parents fight as they spend too much money on legal bills and become angrier with each other. Eventually, one of Suzie’s parents, most likely her dad, will basically become an every-other-weekend visitor in her life. That’s a sad present for a dad on Father’s Day — and for Suzie.What will cause the huge difference in the girls’ lives? Each girl loves both her parents and all the parents are good caregivers. The difference is caused, believe it or not, by the few miles between them. Ava lives in Kentucky, where a law was passed last year ensuring that children of divorce get to see both parents equally. Suzie lives in Missouri, where the lack of such a law drives parents to fight tooth and nail to “win” custody if they are to continue in their full parenting role.Kentucky’s law, the first real shared-parenting law in the nation, passed just one year ago and has a presumption that both parents have equal decision making and parenting time. This arrangement is true shared parenting. Decades of scientific research show this is generally the best arrangement for children in divorced families. Kentucky’s law excludes parents who are likely to abuse or neglect a child, of course. But for the vast majority of families, both parents can be assured of a full continuing parent-child relationship.

In contrast, Missouri’s law is based on the court choosing a primary custodian for the children. In other words, one of Suzie’s parents retains the role as a real parent. The other one is pushed to the edges of her life and only gets to see her during what is often limited “visitation.” Suzie wants to stay close to both of her quality parents but the state of Missouri makes this difficult unless the parents both agree to it from the outset. When they don’t, Missouri drives them to put on their boxing gloves and fight with everything they have. It’s no wonder so many good people, and their children, go through tough divorces.Last month, there was hope for Suzie and all of Missouri’s children when state lawmakers considered a presumption of equal parenting time. House Bill 229 made it through the House. It was referred to a Senate committee but failed to be brought to the Senate floor for a vote because lawmakers ran out of time. This dealt a devastating blow to children in Missouri, who need and deserve both parents just like their friends in Kentucky.
And why wouldn’t Gov. Mike Parson and other lawmakers support shared parenting? Kentucky’s House passed the law 81-2, and its Senate passed the law unanimously. Research has shown that equal parenting time is best for children of divorce, second only to an intact family. Polling consistently shows that the public supports shared parenting. Divorce doesn’t eliminate the family, it just rearranges it. Children still need the love and attention of both parents and extended families.
Many states now have legislation in the works because children of divorce should not have to feel abandoned by one parent, and parents should not have to fear losing contact with their children. We encourage anyone interested in doing right by our children to send an email to your state representative or senator and ask them to support equal shared parenting. To learn how, visit www.nationalparentsorganization.org.This Father’s Day — and every day — the question to ask is this: When it comes to parenting children, should it really matter which state you live in? Every state in the nation should follow Kentucky’s lead and give children what they need and want — both parents.Matt Hale is former chair of the Kentucky chapter and current board member of the National Parents Organization.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Strike 3: Missouri's election chief rejects another effort to let voters weigh in on abortion law,"Jun 11, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/strike-missouri-s-election-chief-rejects-another-effort-to-let/article_b5e26714-b2d8-54be-8e63-cdb4f341c6b6.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — Missouri’s top election chief Tuesday rejected a third proposal to allow voters to weigh in on the state’s tough new abortion law.Citing a similar argument to one he made when rejecting two previous referendum requests last week, Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft said the fact that one part of the abortion law is already in effect bars the law from being put before voters in 2020.The decision came just minutes after an appeal hearing on the two other requests ended without a rulingon whether Ashcroft’s decision should be overruled.

Circuit Judge Daniel Green of Cole County wants opponents of the law to submit a new request for relief after he found technical problems with their argument. The next hearing on the matter is set for Monday.The action came a day after St. Louis Circuit Judge Michael Stelzer granted Planned Parenthood of St. Louis a preliminary injunction in a separate case allowing Missouri’s only abortion clinic to remain open for now.That order was the latest decision in Planned Parenthood’s legal fight to keep Missouri from becoming the first U.S. state without an abortion clinic since the Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade decision in 1973 established a woman’s right to terminate her pregnancy.Stelzer’s order mandates the Department of Health and Senior Services issue a decision on the renewal of Planned Parenthood’s license “without undue delay but no later than June 21.”The judge did not tell the state how to rule. “The authority to make that decision rests exclusively with the Department of Health and Senior Services,” the order said.The new law bans abortions at the eighth week of a pregnancy, except in medical emergencies. There is no exception for pregnancies caused by rape or incest.The law would ban abortion completely in Missouri if the Supreme Court overturns the Roe v. Wade ruling.The American Civil Liberties Union of Missouri and Joplin roofing magnate David Humphreys, who is a major donor to Republican causes, want voters to have the opportunity to reject the law.Under the state constitution, most new laws in Missouri take effect Aug. 28 of each year.However, before sending the measure to Gov. Mike Parson, Republicans inserted a clause to have part of the law take effect immediately. That clause concerns parental notification of a minor’s abortion.In rejecting the petitions, Ashcroft cited a provision in the constitution that prohibits referendums on “laws necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health or safety.”The ACLU and Humphreys contend Missouri case law states that judges can determine whether an emergency clause is valid.Attorney Lowell Pearson, who is representing Humphreys, said the emergency clause prohibition on referendums doesn’t apply because only part of the bill, and not the entire measure, went into effect right away.The ACLU said the emergency clause was included “not because of an immediate need to preserve the public peace, health, or safety but rather in order to defeat any attempt to refer the bill for voter approval or rejection under the fundamental right of referendum described in Missouri.”The third petition, which was submitted by Humphreys, asks voters to strike everything in the law except the two-parent notification provision.
Ashcroft said that maneuver wouldn’t work.“A small number of state constitutions provide an option to refer a portion of a law to the people for a vote, but Missouri does not have that option,” Ashcroft said in a statement Tuesday.Groups seeking to overturn the law have until Aug. 28 to gather an estimated 100,000 signatures to stop the law from going into effect until a referendum is held.Although the clock is ticking, Pearson told reporters he’s not worried about running out of time.“It is unlikely to cause any delay,” Pearson said.License dispute
The fight over the new law comes against the backdrop of a separate licensing dispute between the state and Planned Parenthood’s Central West Ed clinic.Planned Parenthood sued the department last month, alleging the state agency had illegally refused to renew the St. Louis abortion clinic’s yearly license until the state could complete an investigation into an unspecified patient complaint.The department alleged it found instances of “multiple” failed abortions at the clinic and that Planned Parenthood was not complying with further investigation. The license was to expire Friday.Planned Parenthood argued in court that Missouri had no right to withhold the license because it had corrected the problems cited by the state. One of the deficiencies the state cited was the timing of a pelvic exam and the clinic’s failure to ensure the doctor providing an “informed consent visit” 72 hours before an abortion was the same one performing the procedure. The clinic says it corrected all deficiencies the state cited in its inspection.The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, which sets guidelines for women’s health care, criticized the Missouri Legislature and health department for creating “unnecessary obstacles for women trying to access constitutionally protected, medically appropriate care.”“It is unacceptable that lawmakers and bureaucrats are attempting to dictate how doctors practice medicine without regard to medical science and are treating them like criminals,” the organization said in a statement. “While pelvic exams may be appropriate for patients with certain conditions, routine multiple pelvic exams for women seeking abortion care are unwarranted, invasive, and not supported by evidence.”State health department chief Dr. Randall Williams, who is licensed by Missouri as an obstetrician-gynecologist and is a member of the national medical organization, has previously called pre-abortion pelvic exams “good, standard medical practice.”The health department in a news release Monday said the pelvic exam has been part of mandatory health assessment since 1988, and that the regulation requiring the exam has changed only once, in 2018. The statement came in response to what it said was inaccurate information reported by “a national media outlet.”In response, Dr. Colleen McNicholas, an obstetrician-gynecologist at Planned Parenthood in St. Louis, and the clinic’s medical director, Dr. David Eisenberg, held a press conference Tuesday at the clinic.The state recently started enforcing “medically unnecessary and invasive” pelvic exams on women seeking medication abortions, who make up more than one-third of the clinic’s patients, Eisenberg said.“I can’t explain why they would justify such a change in their interpretation other than their intent to stop abortion care being available in the state of Missouri,” Eisenberg said.Blythe Bernhard of the Post-Dispatch contributed to this report.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri attorney general quiet so far on auditor's Sunshine Law questions,"Jun 11, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-attorney-general-quiet-so-far-on-auditor-s-sunshine/article_5d532be3-f3d3-514b-af13-538e8a4d9336.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — Attorney General Eric Schmitt has not said whether state agencies may cite the First Amendment to redact public records — and he may not ever answer that question, according to documents reviewed by the Post-Dispatch.Gov. Mike Parson’s attorneys have cited the First Amendment numerous times as a reason to hide the contact information of private residents from public scrutiny.Parson’s spokesman has said disclosure of such information may have a chilling effect on individuals contacting their government, and has said the office has redacted such information in the past without citing the First Amendment.

Auditor Nicole Galloway, a Democrat who is considering running against Parson next year, asked Schmitt on May 7 to issue an opinion on the validity of Parson’s First Amendment citations.“Government should not be in the business of finding ways to hide information from taxpayers, but time and again, we have seen continued efforts to do just that,” Galloway said at the time.On May 9, Jonathan M. Hensley, deputy general counsel for the attorney general’s office, said in a letter to Galloway that the office had received the “request for an Attorney General’s opinion regarding whether identifying information related to an individual conducting business before a state entity should be redacted under the Sunshine Law.”But that wasn’t the question Galloway wanted an answer to, Paul Harper, general counsel for the auditor’s office, wrote back on May 14.“I am writing this letter to confirm that this description was not intended to limit the question asked,” Harper wrote on May 14. “The State Auditor is seeking an Attorney General Opinion on a question of law related to whether the First Amendment of the US Constitution provides an exception to the Sunshine Law such that a government entity can redact, any or possibly all, identifying information related to an individual who is conducting or seeking to conduct business before the entity.”
Steph Deidrick, spokeswoman for Galloway, said the office has not received correspondence from the attorney general’s office since the May 9 letter.That letter went on to say: “We generally work on the opinion requests in the order that they are received and make every effort to complete them in a timely fashion. We will contact you within 90 days of receipt of the opinion request.”
Chris Nuelle, spokesman for the attorney general’s office, said it is office policy not to comment on pending requests, but said “the request for legal opinion is under review.”“I cannot fathom the theory under which they came up with that argument, because the First Amendment deals with freedom of speech and the ability to speak what you want to say, and it doesn’t at all deal with public officials closing public records,” said Jean Maneke, counsel for the Missouri Press Association.She said people who contact the government “know they’re contacting a public official. They know that this is a person that has to do things publicly.”After Galloway’s office submitted the request, Steele Shippy, the governor’s spokesman, told the Kansas City Star, which first reported the use of the First Amendment citation, that the letter was “yet another lame partisan political attempt.”Schmitt, a Republican, was appointed by Parson, also a Republican, to be attorney general last year after then-Attorney General Josh Hawley won election to the U.S. Senate.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"St. Louis abortion clinic can stay open, for now","Jun 11, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/st-louis-abortion-clinic-can-stay-open-for-now/article_22730b56-727e-5833-ab69-a168cb64990d.html,"ST. LOUIS — Circuit Judge Michael Stelzer granted Planned Parenthood of St. Louis a preliminary injunction Monday, allowing Missouri’s only abortion clinic to remain open for now.Stelzer’s order Monday was the latest decision in Planned Parenthood’s legal fight to keep Missouri from becoming the first U.S. state without an abortion clinic since the Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade decision in 1973 established a woman’s right to terminate her pregnancy.The order mandates that the Department of Health and Senior Services issue a decision on the renewal of Planned Parenthood’s license “without undue delay but no later than June 21.”

Stelzer did not tell the state how to rule. “The authority to make that decision rests exclusively with the Department of Health and Senior Services,” the order said.Planned Parenthood lauded the decision but said its fight against abortion bans is not over.“Today’s ruling gives doctors like me the ability to wake up tomorrow and continue providing safe, legal abortion in the last health center in the state that provides abortion care,” Colleen McNicholas, an obstetrician-gynecologist at the Planned Parenthood facility, said in a written statement. “For patients, that means for now, they can continue to make decisions about their bodies, lives, and future in their home state.”Mary Maschmeier, who leads a local anti-abortion group, said she hopes DHSS does not renew Planned Parenthood’s abortion clinic license.“I’m hoping that the health department will stay firm on the original decision not to renew the license,” she said. “They (Planned Parenthood) need to fix the problems they have, not continue on making more problems.”A representative of the Department of Health and Senior Services did not respond to requests for comment.Planned Parenthood sued the department last month, alleging the state agency had illegally refused to renew the St. Louis abortion clinic’s yearly license until the state could complete an investigation into an unspecified patient complaint.The department alleged it found instances of “multiple” failed abortions at the abortion clinic in the Central West End and that Planned Parenthood was not complying with further investigation.Planned Parenthood argued in court that Missouri had no right to withhold the license for the clinic because it had corrected the problems cited by the state.The Department of Health and Senior Services argued that Planned Parenthood failed to comply with the investigation because it refused to make available for interview seven physicians who had worked at the clinic .The department also argued that a state administrative commission — not a state court — is the proper place for Planned Parenthood’s complaint.
Stelzer’s ruling Monday said he relied on three factors in making his decision: Missouri’s abortion clinic licensing rules may conflict with law; “immediate injury will occur” if its license is allowed to expire; and “the balance between such harm and the injury inflicted” by his decision.The injunction “merely maintains the status quo and is not a ruling on the merits,” Stelzer said.“Finally, the court must weigh the public interest in granting a preliminary injunction,” Stelzer wrote. “Here, the public interest is heightened by the level of scrutiny this case has received and by the strong opinions expressed on both sides of the abortion debate.”Stelzer said DHSS must make a decision, but Planned Parenthood is entitled to a review of that decision by a state licensing commission.
“The court does not believe that an ‘official action’ can include non-action,” Stelzer wrote. “The court finds that petitioner is entitled to a decision from DHSS on its application for renewal of its license.”Stelzer set a status conference for 9 a.m. June 21 in the case.Late last month, Gov. Mike Parson signed one of the nation’s strictest abortion laws, banning them after the eighth week of pregnancy. The ban and the withholding of Planned Parenthood’s license renewal have together turned the nation’s attention on Missouri, one of several states to pass stricter abortion laws.The new law takes effect Aug. 28.The Missouri chapter of the group NARAL Pro-Choice America said Monday that DHSS was using the licensing process to try to effectively ban abortion.“Governor Parson and the anti-choice movement have proven to us that they will continue to fight to restrict access to reproductive healthcare whether it be through legislative attacks or this move to weaponize the licensure process,” said Mallory Schwarz, NARAL Pro-Choice Missouri executive director.“Their goal is to send Missouri to the forefront of a political race to criminalize abortion and shame those who have abortions. Today we celebrate, but the fight for reproductive freedom will continue.”

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Term limits mean St. Charles County senator can't run again, but he's still raising money","Jun 11, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/term-limits-mean-st-charles-county-senator-can-t-run/article_2835d02e-90c3-5579-93ee-576e823e5403.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — Even though he can’t run for the state Senate again because of term limits, a St. Charles County Republican is continuing to raise money for his campaign fund.Sen. Bob Onder, of Lake Saint Louis, is among a trio of GOP lawmakers tag-teaming on a fundraiser in St. Louis on Thursday.Onder, who won re-election last year to his second and final four-year term in the Legislature’s upper chamber, now lists himself as seeking an unspecified statewide office.

He told the Post-Dispatch this week that he hasn’t decided what he might do next.“At this point I don’t have any particular plans for future runs,” Onder said. “I definitely wouldn’t rule one out.”All statewide offices except for auditor will be on the 2020 ballot. Each are currently held by Republicans.Onder, a physician and small business owner, said he may use money donated to his account to help finance the election of other Republican senators, state representatives and county-level candidates.“I will be continuing to fundraise,” said Onder, who had more than $210,000 in his campaign account as of April 1.Last year, Onder was among those seeking to be appointed state treasurer to fill the vacancy left by Eric Schmitt’s move to the attorney general’s post.
Gov. Mike Parson ultimately chose former Rep. Scott Fitzpatrick, R-Shell Knob, for the $108,000-per-year job.In May, Onder didn’t want to discuss his unsuccessful bid for the appointment.“Yeah, I don’t have a comment on that,” he said. “I think the governor had considered a lot of people and I think his selection of Scott Fitzpatrick was an excellent choice and I really strongly support Scott. He’s a good friend of mine and I look forward to helping him win his election to treasurer in 2020.”
Onder, last year, also lost to Sen. Dave Schatz, R-Sullivan, when the two ran for Senate president pro tem. Also in the running were Republican Sens. Mike Cunningham and Ed Emery.Following that, Onder helped form a six-member bloc of GOP senators into what became known as the Conservative Caucus.During the recent legislative session, Onder often sparred with Parson, a fellow Republican. During the final week of the legislative session Onder and other members of the caucus tried to derail a new $10 million scholarship program championed by the governor as well as other incentives the bloc called “corporate welfare.”Onder and others involved in the filibuster ultimately relented and allowed a vote on the measure so the Senate would have enough time to approve a restrictive new abortion law before the Legislature’s May 17 adjournment.Two other members of the caucus — Bill Eigel of Weldon Spring and Andrew Koenig of Manchester — will join Onder at the fundraiser at the Kiel Club at the Stifel Theatre in downtown St. Louis.Koenig, the sponsor of the abortion law, faces a potentially high-profile challenge from Democrats in 2020. Eigel also is up for reelection next year.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri Gov. Mike Parson signs $30 billion budget,"Jun 10, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-gov-mike-parson-signs-billion-budget/article_d54a77a3-470a-5eed-b097-f4393cbaee1c.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — Gov. Mike Parson on Monday signed the state’s $30 billion budget for the fiscal year that starts July 1, finalizing the plan that allocates state support for everything from schools to infrastructure to conservation efforts.Much of the Republican governor’s plan, which he outlined in January, survived the legislative budgeting process. Parson, a Republican, did not issue any line-item vetoes, meaning lawmakers won’t have to debate overriding any budget moves later this year.“We are proud of the General Assembly and their efforts with the fiscal year 2020 budget,” Parson said in a statement. “They have created a fiscally-responsible, balanced budget that will move Missouri forward.”

State workers are poised to receive a 3% raise while Department of Corrections employees will receive additional salary increases in an effort to attract and retain prison officials.The formula used to calculate state aid for K-12 education will be fully funded, with public schools receiving $61.4 million more than this fiscal year, bringing total K-12 spending to $3.54 billion. Public colleges and universities will receive small increases to core funding.The plan also includes $10 million in lottery funds that will go to the “Fast Track” scholarship program for students 25 or older.The governor also won the authority to sell bonds for bridge repairs.In January, Parson proposed selling $350 million worth of bonds, but the Legislature pared that amount to $301 million. The authority to issue the bonds is also contingent on the state winning a federal grant for bridge repairs.
Also included in the spending plan is $50 million in general revenue for bridge repairs, as well as an additional $50 million to be used for an infrastructure cost-share program between cities and the state.The state’s public defenders, despite still being chronically underfunded, also scored minor wins: $500,000 in new spending to address the public defenders’ case backlog; and $913,786 for two juvenile units in St. Louis and Kansas City.
About one-third of the state’s budget is funded by state general revenue. One-third is made up of other funds, while the rest comes from the federal government.As of Friday, net general revenue collections had swelled to $8.9 billion for the fiscal year, a 1.59% increase over net collections at the same point last year.Officials had predicted state revenue would grow by 1.7% this fiscal year.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Latest flood, same complaints: Levees and flood plain development make matters worse","Jun 9, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/latest-flood-same-complaints-levees-and-flood-plain-development-make/article_a4bc876a-c2c7-51c2-9f89-4884b6bc3f3d.html,"ST. LOUIS — The near-historic crest of the Mississippi River soon will be in the rearview mirror for the St. Louis area, with water levels starting to fall this week after reaching their second-highest mark on record.But even if conditions stay dry locally and upstream, it will likely take weeks, at least, for major rivers to return to normal. Some flood-ravaged towns, meanwhile, may need to wait even longer to begin an arduous and expensive recovery process.Of course, much of the region has been through this before — during record flooding in 1993, for instance, and many times this decade alone, including 2013, 2016, and 2017.

As another recovery begins, some critics echo now-familiar, but still unheeded, warnings that it is time to reassess flood policy. And after a quarter century of routine major flooding, they ask when lessons will finally be learned, and when something might be done to minimize future impact.“There are a lot of people out there who understand that we’re making it worse,” said David Stokes, executive director of the Great Rivers Habitat Alliance, an organization focused on river management issues. “Twenty-six years later, we’re basically repeating it. And this is after astronomical flooding in recent years.”Stokes says prevailing policies to build expansive levee systems and promote flood plain development need to change. He recounts taking a recent helicopter ride to survey this year’s “mind-boggling” expanses of local flooding — areas that stand in stark contrast to rival swaths of levee-protected flood plain.“I see Chesterfield Valley totally dry, which is a good thing that it’s dry, but where do they move all of that water?” Stokes asks. “We’ve taken it away from the river where nature intended for it to go, and moved it to create this damage.”Complaints about levees aren’t new. Throughout recent years, Stokes and others have criticized them for worsening floods by constricting river systems, and blame them for simply pushing risk to neighboring areas. But those complaints in the Mississippi River basin go back to at least 1852, when an engineer named Charles Ellet voiced similar concerns about levees in a report to Congress.“Maybe one of these years, someone will start listening to him,” said Stokes.With climate change boosting the likelihood of extreme precipitation, he said that message is only becoming more urgent.“We’re getting more water than we used to,” he said. “And now it’s got nowhere to go.”The same worries are shared by others, including Jonathan Remo, a Southern Illinois University Carbondale professor specializing in flood and river issues.“I’m really shocked about how wet it’s been for the last decade or so,” said Remo, adding that climate modeling suggests that the trend “is what we expect” to see more of.“It looks more and more like there’s a strong climate signal on top of the same cast of characters,” said Remo, describing the combination of more extreme precipitation and the human changes made to watersheds, such as constricting rivers with sprawling levee systems.But with floods in 2019 and other recent years pushing engineered river systems to the very limits, Remo is nervous that there will come a point where society can no longer squeak by, dodging bullets.
“It’s a recipe waiting for disaster in the future,” he said. “Something is going to go catastrophically wrong with the system at some point, and then maybe we’ll see some change.”Based on the political landscape, the outlook for flood policy critics is not too rosy. Even after this latest episode of major flooding, Stokes and Remo fear that leaders will not pursue helpful change.In response to this year’s floods, politicians including Sen. Roy Blunt, Sen. Josh Hawley, and Gov. Mike Parson, have all called for flood protection — and especially protection for farmers — to become a greater priority for agencies like the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.At an April meeting with the corps attended by Parson and leaders of other flood-affected states, Gov. Pete Ricketts of Nebraska specifically called for “rebuilding bigger and better than before to keep people safe.”There is concern that the stances of those elected officials signal that they are not taking a more critical look at levees and how they may contribute to flood problems.
“The lesson has got to be that levees are not the way to answer this flood. … I fear that, from very powerful interest groups, they’re getting the very opposite message,” said Stokes, explaining that groups supporting farmers and engineers have already begun “to use this to demand more spending on structural flood control.”“Their plan would just make the next flood even worse,” he adds, describing the dangers of blocking off even more of the river system’s flood plains. “Where in God’s name do they think this water is going to go?”Remo, at least, is not holding his breath for change, explaining that the “political will” is simply not there.“All of the beneficiaries of the current system are still kind of locked into their position,” he said. “I just think (this flood) is the latest installment of an ongoing series, and I expect more in the near future.”

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri investigating St. Louis Planned Parenthood for 'multiple' failed abortions,"Jun 8, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/missouri-investigating-st-louis-planned-parenthood-for-multiple-failed-abortions/article_237832ab-dd41-532f-b839-3d1f627d028f.html,"ST. LOUIS – The state said Friday it is investigating the local Planned Parenthood office for “multiple” failed abortions, revealing for the first time why it is holding up the Central West End clinic’s license.The state alleged in a statement on Friday that women remained pregnant after the St. Louis clinic performed abortions on them.But a Planned Parenthood official called the state’s announcement “fear mongering” and a “diversionary tactic” that shows it “is treating Planned Parenthood differently in the inspection process.”

“The state continues to hold our license hostage, creating worry and uncertainty for our patients,” Dr. Colleen McNicholas, obstetrician-gynecologist at the St. Louis location, said in a statement.The disclosure of the nature of the state’s investigation comes as Planned Parenthood and the state await a St. Louis judge’s ruling in Planned Parenthood’s lawsuit alleging the state had illegally refused to renew the St. Louis abortion clinic’s yearly license until the state could complete an investigation into an unspecified patient complaint.In March, the state Department of Health and Senior Services held its annual inspection of the St. Louis clinic.In the statement released Friday, the state said regulators identified “serious concerns” during that inspection regarding the handling of fetal tissue extracted from abortions.The state called the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, which opened an investigation into a laboratory contracted by Planned Parenthood to handle fetal tissue, the state said. Federal investigators were trying to determine why women remained pregnant post-abortion. That lab cooperated with the federal agency, confirming the concerns regarding the handling of the tissue provided by Planned Parenthood, the state said.A failed surgical abortion is “very rare,” the state said in its statement, and can usually be detected by the physician who performed the abortion.Failed or incomplete abortions occur in fewer than 1% of procedures, according to the American Pregnancy Association. Women at greater risk of incomplete abortion are those in early stages of pregnancy, those who have prior Cesarean sections or those with a misshapen uterus.Incomplete abortion results in termination of pregnancy in most cases and can lead to prolonged bleeding, cramping and infection. An additional procedure called a dilation and curettage may be required to remove remaining tissue.
As a result of the federal investigation into the lab, Columbia, Mo.-based Boyce & Bynum Pathology Laboratories, lost its accreditation, the state said.A representative from the lab could not immediately be reached.Further investigation has been limited, the state said on Friday, by the “refusal of Planned Parenthood” to make available to investigators the doctors who performed the abortions.
Lisa Cox, spokeswoman for the state department, said Planned Parenthood performed “multiple” failed abortions, but would not say how many.The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services told Boyce & Bynum on Thursday that the laboratory’s accreditation was restored. It was not immediately clear why.But the re-accreditation of Boyce & Bynum, the state said in its statement, allowed the state to publicly release details of its Planned Parenthood investigation for the first time.The legal fight stems from the state’s request to interview in its investigation seven physicians, all who had worked at the Planned Parenthood clinic.If the facility’s license is not renewed, Missouri would become the first U.S. state without an abortion clinic since the Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade decision in 1973 that established a woman’s right to terminate her pregnancy.Late last month, Gov. Mike Parson signed one of the nation’s strictest abortion laws, banning them after the eighth week of pregnancy.Blythe Bernhard of the Post-Dispatch staff contributed to this report.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Big money flows into fight over Missouri's new abortion law,"Jun 7, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/big-money-flows-into-fight-over-missouri-s-new-abortion/article_5283fc39-0a5c-5365-a385-e332abe0963c.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — As promised, a wealthy conservative donor to Republican causes has written a $1 million check in an effort to overturn Missouri’s restrictive new abortion law.A filing with state campaign regulators Friday shows the money from David Humphreys going to a newly formed political action committee known as the Committee to Protect the Rights of Victims of Rape & Incest.It is the first known contribution to the PAC.

Humphreys, a Joplin businessman, had previously urged Republican Gov. Mike Parson to veto the abortion changes, saying a lack of exceptions in House Bill 126 allowing for abortion in cases of rape and incest “is bad public policy and bad for Missourians.”At the time, Humphreys said he would back a referendum asking voters to overturn the legislation if the governor put his signature on the measure.The big money contribution is the latest development in the fight over the new law and the future of abortion in Missouri.State regulators, for example, are clashing with Planned Parenthood over licensing for the state’s lone abortion provider in St. Louis’ Central West End neighborhood.On Thursday, Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft said he had rejected two proposed referendums on the law submitted by the Humphreys-back group and the ACLU of Missouri.Ashcroft, a Republican, said he could not allow the petitions to move forward because part of the law took effect immediately after Parson signed it last month.The provision banning most abortions at eight weeks of pregnancy takes effect on Aug. 28, but a lesser-known provision that requires two-parent notification for minors seeking an abortion took effect last month.The Republican-led Legislature tacked on what is known as an “emergency clause” to the two-parent notification requirement — the reason that provision took effect immediately.“Because of that declaration by the Legislature, and because of the responsibility of the Secretary of State’s office to follow Missouri Supreme Court precedent, and the Constitution, we have no other avenue but to reject Referendum 1 and Referendum 2,” Ashcroft said.Humphreys and the ACLU want the referendums to be approved so backers may start collecting signatures to place a question on the November 2020 ballot.
If the courts reverse Ashcroft’s action, and the language is approved, proponents of a referendum will have until Aug. 28 to turn in more than 100,000 signatures to the secretary of state in order to suspend the law until voters weigh in.Ashcroft’s office has made no decision on the validity of a third referendum, also submitted by Humphreys. That proposal seeks to strike everything but the two-parent notification.Lowell Pearson, attorney for Humphreys, filed a lawsuit Friday challenging Ashcroft’s action in court. Pearson said the emergency clause applies to less than 10% of the entire law, meaning the entire law has not been deemed an emergency, only a section.“We are requesting immediate relief from the Cole County Circuit Court to allow our petition to proceed, which will let Missouri voters decide this monumental public policy issue. Our campaign began to ensure women and underage minors who are the victims of rape and incest are protected. This is a significant step forward in the fight to protect those who have already been victimized by rape or incest. We are committed to that goal,” Humphreys said in a statement Friday.Among those named in the suit was Auditor Nicole Galloway, a Democrat who opposes the new law.
She said she was included in the legal effort because her office is merely fulfilling its responsibility to create an analysis of the costs of the ballot measure.Under state law, within 20 days of receiving a proposed petition, the auditor sends the fiscal note to the attorney general as part of the initiative petition process.“Auditor Galloway has consistently expressed a deep concern about efforts to stifle the voice of the people on ballot initiatives. She disagrees with this latest attempt to limit the power of Missourians to have their voices heard. Auditor Galloway is fighting to uphold citizens’ constitutional rights to hold Jefferson City accountable through the referendum process,” noted a statement issued Friday.The law bans abortions at eight weeks, meaning access to abortion in the earliest stages of a pregnancy would not be banned.But after eight weeks, the only exceptions allowing for abortions would be in medical emergencies. There are no exceptions in cases of rape or incest.While the law allows abortions before eight weeks of pregnancy, if the landmark Roe v. Wade case is overturned by the conservative U.S. Supreme Court, that ruling would trigger another provision in Missouri’s law outlawing nearly all abortions; the only exception would be in medical emergencies.Humphreys, whose Tamko Building Products makes roofing shingles, has funneled millions of dollars toward GOP causes in recent years, including to the election of U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley and to the House Republican fundraising arm.During the 2016 election cycle, Humphreys and his family contributed more than $14 million to Republicans.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri secretary of state bats down referendum on new abortion law,"Jun 6, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-secretary-of-state-bats-down-referendum-on-new-abortion/article_ad83ba84-d4b7-52c8-9d9c-41210597b211.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft said Thursday he had rejected two proposed referendums on the state's new abortion law, a setback for abortion rights proponents seeking to place a measure on the 2020 ballot.Within hours, the ACLU of Missouri, which filed one of the petitions, said it had filed a lawsuit in Cole County Circuit Court asking for a temporary restraining order and injunction barring the secretary of state's action.Ashcroft, a Republican, said he could not allow the petitions to move forward because part of the law took effect immediately after Gov. Mike Parson signed it last month.

The provision banning most abortions at eight weeks of pregnancy takes effect on Aug. 28, but a lesser-known provision that requires two-parent notification for minors seeking an abortion took effect last month.The Republican-led Legislature tacked on what is known as an ""emergency clause"" to the two-parent notification requirement — the reason that provision took effect immediately.""Because of that declaration by the Legislature, and because of the responsibility of the Secretary of State's office to follow Missouri Supreme Court precedent, and the Constitution, we have no other avenue but to reject Referendum 1 and Referendum 2,"" Ashcroft said.The ACLU and GOP mega-donor David Humphreys last month submitted two proposed referendums to Ashcroft. Humphreys and the ACLU want the referendums to be approved so backers may start collecting signatures to place a question on the November 2020 ballot.Tony Rothert, attorney for the ACLU, called Ashcroft's move ""cowardly"" and an attempt to deprive residents of their right to reject newly passed laws.""This move is so predictable, we've already assembled our suit to require the Secretary of State to put aside his anti-abortion agenda and do his job by certifying the referendum,"" Rothert said in a statement Thursday morning.If the courts reverse Ashcroft's action, and the language is approved, proponents of a referendum will have until Aug. 28 to turn in more than 100,000 signatures to the secretary of state in order to place the question on the ballot.Ashcroft's office has made no decision on the validity of a third referendum, also submitted by Humphreys. That referendum seeks to strike everything but the two-parent notification.As Ashcroft made his announcement, lawyer Chuck Hatfield, a Democrat, said the courts have ruled that ""true emergency bills ARE exempt from referendum but courts have held that just [because] Legislature says it doesn't make it so.""Ashcroft, at the news conference, said Hatfield was probably referring to Westhues v. Sullivan and Pollock v. Becker, two century-old court cases.Ashcroft said the two cases make ""it clear that the Secretary of State's Office does not have the ability to decide whether or not an emergency clause is truly an emergency.""Ashcroft said the courts would have to decide whether the two-parent notification piece is truly an emergency.Democrats used the Westhues case as ammunition after Ashcroft's news conference.""Nearly a century ago, the Missouri Supreme Court ruled in Westhues v. Sullivan that the General Assembly cannot thwart a bill from being subject to a referendum petition simply by tacking on an emergency clause,"" House Minority Leader Crystal Quade said in a statement. ""Secretary Ashcroft should voluntarily certify these petitions for circulation before a court orders him to do so.""Lowell Pearson, attorney for Humphreys, said he was planning to challenge Ashcroft's action in court. Pearson said the emergency clause applies to less than 10% of the entire law, meaning the entire law has not been deemed an emergency, only a section. 
The constitution prevents referendums on laws with emergency clauses, not sections, Pearson said.He also predicted Missouri courts would side with petitioners because the state constitution says the power of the government is ""derived from the People.""""The initiative and referendum procedures are a reservation of rights by the People against the government,"" Pearson said in a Wednesday letter to Ashcroft.In a Remington Research survey conducted between May 22 and 23 of Missouri voters, 57% of respondents described themselves as ""pro-life"" while 43% described themselves as ""pro-choice.""The poll surveyed 1,042 likely 2020 general election voters and the margin of error was plus or minus 3%.The Missouri law bans abortions at eight weeks, meaning access to abortion in the earliest stages of a pregnancy would not be banned.
But after eight weeks, the only exceptions allowing for abortions would be in medical emergencies. There are no exceptions in cases of rape or incest.While the law allows abortions before eight weeks of pregnancy, if the landmark Roe v. Wade case is overturned by the conservative U.S. Supreme Court, that ruling would trigger another provision in Missouri's law outlawing nearly all abortions; the only exception would be in medical emergencies.Thirty-two percent of Remington poll respondents said they would support a ban on abortions with no rape or incest exceptions, while 54% of respondents said they would oppose such a ban; 14% said they were unsure.Fifty-one percent of respondents said they would support a ban on abortion if there were rape and incest exceptions, while 34% said they would oppose such a law; 15% of respondents weren't sure.Meanwhile, 40% of respondents said Roe v. Wade should be overturned while 47% said that it should not be overturned; 13% were not sure.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Judge weighs license renewal for Planned Parenthood in St. Louis,"Jun 5, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/judge-weighs-license-renewal-for-planned-parenthood-in-st-louis/article_a5590c6b-d1b9-5912-be44-e2adc38293b2.html,"ST. LOUIS — Planned Parenthood argued in court on Wednesday that Missouri has no right to withhold the license for the Central West End abortion clinic because it has corrected all of the problems cited by the state.Lawyers for the state disagreed, saying Planned Parenthood has not complied with state demands regarding an ongoing investigation into clinic practices.“We are looking at deeply troubling issues of patient care,” said Assistant Attorney General D. John Sauer.

The hearing before Circuit Judge Michael Stelzer centered on technical language in state laws and regulations for renewing health care facilities. The dispute is over Planned Parenthood’s refusal to make available five private doctors to be interviewed as part of the state investigation of the facility.Planned Parenthood’s lawyer Jamie Boyer argued state rules mandate the renewal of its license because the clinic has corrected deficiencies uncovered in a routine inspection. Sauer, the lawyer for the state, disagreed, saying Planned Parenthood has failed to comply by not compelling the five doctors to be interviewed. He also said a state administrative commission — not a state court — is the proper place for Planned Parenthood’s complaint.Stelzer did not rule on Wednesday whether to issue a preliminary injunction that would allow the clinic to continue performing abortions, and did not indicate when he would rule.Wednesday’s hearing was the latest step in Planned Parenthood’s legal fight to keep Missouri from becoming the first U.S. state without an abortion clinic since the Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade decision in 1973 that established a woman’s right to terminate her pregnancy.Stelzer last week issued a temporary restraining order preventing Planned Parenthood’s license from expiring at midnight Friday. The ruling was part of the clinic’s lawsuit against the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services, alleging the state agency had illegally refused to renew the St. Louis abortion clinic’s yearly license.Late last month, Gov. Mike Parson signed one of the nation’s strictest abortion laws, banning them after the eighth week of pregnancy. The two events have together turned the nation’s attention on Missouri, one of several states to pass stricter abortion laws.The new law takes effect on Aug. 28.After Wednesday’s hearing, Dr. Randall Williams, the director of the state’s Department of Health and Senior Services, declined to describe “multiple” deficiencies found by inspectors at the St. Louis clinic, but said they were “critical” matters of life-and-death that will become public record once the state has finished its investigation.“Many Missourians are pro-choice. Many Missourians are pro-life,” he said. “What all those Missourians expect me to do in a regulatory fashion is to enforce the law, enforce the regulations and keep people safe.”
M’Evie Mead, the director of Planned Parenthood Advocates of Missouri, said Parson has put Missouri in the headlines for “all the wrong reasons.”

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Parson disingenuous about women’s health care,"Jun 5, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/mailbag/parson-disingenuous-about-women-s-health-care/article_f6753b60-5996-5483-86ec-6cfde216701d.html,"I recently heard Gov. Mike Parson talk about “standards of care” for women while trying to explain his attack on Planned Parenthood and Missouri women’s rights. What a joke. If you read the court documents, you’ll see state lawmakers require women to undergo two invasive, traumatic, non-medically recommended pelvic exams to bully and punish women seeking their constitutionally-protected right to abortion.

It’s comparable to state-sponsored rape in my opinion, and it makes the claim that Missouri cares about standards of care as laughable as Parson’s claim that he cares about women’s health. How about every man suspected of creating an unwanted pregnancy undergo a mandatory cystoscopy or two? Look it up, then tell me about women’s rights.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri budget numbers on plus side heading toward final weeks of fiscal year,"Jun 5, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-budget-numbers-on-plus-side-heading-toward-final-weeks/article_55a474d8-dce0-5a69-a578-08ec852e16f5.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — After lagging behind estimates for much of the year, state tax collections appear to be on track heading into the final month of the fiscal year.That could mean good news for Republican Gov. Mike Parson, who had been monitoring the potential shortfall earlier this spring in order to determine if he would have to withhold spending to keep the budget balanced.According to Parson’s budget office, the state ended May nearly 2.1 percent ahead of the amount of revenue collected over the same time period a year ago, buoyed largely by an 18 percent increase in tax collections during the prior three months.

All told, the state has collected $9.9 billion this year from individual and corporate income taxes and other fees.In order to avoid making cuts in spending, the state needs to see revenue grow by 1.7 percent through June 30.Parson credited the economy for keeping state revenues in the black.“The governor is encouraged that more Missourians are going back to work, seeing an increase in take-home pay and keeping more of their hard earned money. Employment levels have reached all-time highs and unemployment has remained near historical lows,"" spokesman Steele Shippy said.In addition, for the first time in more than a decade, the governor’s budget did not spend every tax dollar, saving more than $100 million on the bottom line, Shippy said.Budget chief Dan Haug also said low unemployment and trends showing that people are spending money are good signs.""I feel pretty good about where we are. At this point, we're not foreseeing the need for withholds. Revenue has bounced back like we thought and hoped it would,"" Haug said.
The positive revenue forecast comes after months of hand-wringing by state lawmakers, who were watching daily revenue figures roll in far below estimates.Although the state and federal government have cut income tax rates, which could reduce the amount of cash coming into state coffers, part of the problem stemmed from a blunder by the Missouri Department of Revenue.Because of errors in withholding tables drawn up by the department, taxpayers expecting to receive modest refunds instead found they owed the state money. And, for those who did receive a refund, they typically received smaller amounts.The problems were due in part to the December 2017 federal tax overhaul, championed by Republican lawmakers and President Donald Trump.
Congress doubled the standard deduction and eliminated the personal exemption. Missouri bases its income taxes on the federal system and allows a personal exemption only if one is available for federal filers.In the past, taxpayers who minimized the number of dependents generally didn’t owe the state money when they filed.In addition, former Department of Revenue Director Joel Walters said the state did not notice until the federal tax changes a 15-year-old defect in its withholding formula that went unnoticed until the federal tax law exacerbated the impact of the error.A special House committee held numerous hearings into the department’s actions, eventually triggering the resignation of Walters, who had been brought to Missouri by former Gov. Eric Greitens in 2017.Meanwhile, Parson is now reviewing a $30 billion state spending plan for the fiscal year that begins July 1. It is based on revenues growing by 2 percent.The budget blueprint approved by lawmakers last month includes an additional $61 million in core K-12 public school funding, and colleges and universities are set to get at least $1 million more compared to this year.

Circuit Judge Michael Stelzer said “the only issue that is ripe for adjudication” is Planned Parenthood’s request for a preliminary injunction on its claim that the state’s license renewal regulations are at odds with the state constitution.

He also quashed subpoenas filed by the state to compel four doctors to testify in the case. Lawyers for the doctors had shown “that compliance with the subpoenas would present an undue burden and hardship” on the doctors.Stelzer opened Tuesday morning’s hearing by noting “misinformation” about what he had been asked to decide — a licensing issue, not the legality of abortion in Missouri.“The recent changes to the law in Missouri are not in front of this court,” Stelzer said.Stelzer last week issued a temporary restraining order preventing Planned Parenthood’s license from expiring at midnight Friday. The ruling was part of the clinic’s lawsuit against the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services, alleging the state agency had illegally refused to renew the St. Louis abortion clinic’s yearly license until the department could complete an investigation into an unspecified patient complaint.The legal fight stems from the state’s request to interview seven physicians, all of whom had worked at the clinic, as part of the investigation. Five of the doctors, who aren’t employed by Planned Parenthood but come from local university medical programs to treat patients at the clinic, have refused to be interviewed as part of the state’s investigation.If the facility’s license is not renewed, Missouri would become the first U.S. state without an abortion clinic since the Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade decision in 1973 that established a woman’s right to terminate her pregnancy.
Late last month, Gov. Mike Parson signed one of the nation’s strictest abortion laws, banning them after the eighth week of pregnancy. The two events have together turned the nation’s attention on Missouri, one of several states to pass stricter abortion laws.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri handing out no-bid contract to group linked to state prison chief,"Jun 4, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/missouri-handing-out-no-bid-contract-to-group-linked-to/article_d2daabda-7c08-58f2-8107-95ecf5e0b853.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — Gov. Mike Parson’s administration is poised to hand a no-bid contract to a national prison organization with connections to Missouri Department of Corrections Director Anne Precythe.In bidding documents filed May 15, the state announced it would be awarding a six-month contract to the Association of State Correctional Administrators to conduct an evaluation of staffing levels at the state’s 21 prisons.The association “is the only feasible source from which to acquire the custody staffing evaluation services since it is the only national corrections organization to provide the required operations, management and staffing analysis,” the purchasing document notes.

Precythe, who was hired as the top administrator at the sprawling agency by former Gov. Eric Greitens in 2017, serves as treasurer of the association and sits on the organization’s executive committee.Corrections spokeswoman Karen Pojmann told the Post-Dispatch that she doesn’t know how much money the state will be paying the group.“I’m not sure about the cost. We don’t yet have a signed contract in place,” Pojmann said.The evaluation comes as staffing problems at the agency have been well documented in recent years.In January, Parson announced he wanted to give prison guards raises of as much as 13 percent to help slow the high rate of turnover in the agency.Employees in the agency are among the lowest paid in the nation, with correctional officer salaries starting at $28,000 and topping out at $44,476.The pay rate has hampered the department’s recruitment and retention of corrections officers. The job vacancy rate peaked in September 2018, when 848 of the 4,733 guard positions were open. The most recent numbers available show turnover rates of over 18 percent.
The lack of adequate staffing was partly blamed for conditions that sparked a riot by inmates at the Crossroads Corrections Center last year. Inmates were angry about being forced to stay in their cells because of a staffing shortage.On May 12, more than 200 inmates staged a sit-in at the dining hall over reductions in recreation time and other programs. Prison workers were able to convince 131 inmates to end the standoff, but 78 prisoners spent the next six hours rampaging in a central services building.
The Missouri Highway Patrol and local police had to be called in to help quell the disturbance.In January, the Parson administration announced plans to consolidate Crossroads and Western Missouri Correctional Center, both in Cameron, and use the savings to give raises to most of the 11,000 workers at the department.Pojmann said the last time the agency conducted a similar evaluation was a decade ago.“The custody staffing evaluation is our effort to bring in outside industry experts to conduct a shift analysis and review of staffing patterns in correctional centers to maximize efficiency and safety,” Pojmann said in a statement.The association, which is based in Maryland, has conducted similar studies in other states.In a 2014, for example, the association said Nevada should add guards at its prison facilities.“We recommend that 100 staff be hired to avoid having mandated posts go unfilled, or having to fill them with staff working overtime,” the association said in its report.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri's new abortion law is a travesty for women,"Jun 3, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/columnists/missouri-s-new-abortion-law-is-a-travesty-for-women/article_fd6e45c0-6a89-57e8-a871-1e49204e7b69.html,"Missouri finds itself in the national spotlight for all the wrong reasons again — this time, by giving new rights and opportunities to rapists.By signing House Bill 126, which bans abortions even in the case of rape, incest or human trafficking, Gov. Mike Parson has spoken loud and clear. He wants rapists in Missouri to have more power over their victims. He wants a woman’s decisions over her health care to be criminalized. These positions are extreme and cruel.I join the probable majority of Missourians who are appalled by this new law. But I also know this law represents another emotion for Missouri women — fear.

One of the biggest fears a woman has is for her personal safety — the fear of being assaulted or raped. We’ve come to accept the reality that we must protect ourselves from it. We’ve come to accept that we have to be prepared in everyday situations. This is why women carry rape whistles and pepper spray, and have emergency apps on our phones. We carry our keys between our fingers and wear nail polish that can detect date-rape drugs. If we go for a run, we’ve been told to leave one earbud out so we can hear someone coming up behind us.Now, Missouri women have another fear — that in what is potentially their darkest hour, they will be unable to access the care they need. They have fear that if they become a victim of rape, incest or human trafficking, they will not have a choice in what comes next. Instead, a survivor of rape must accept that her attacker could have parental rights. Proponents of this law apparently are comfortable with the idea you could be forced to stand side by side in front of a judge, working out a shared custody plan with your rapist. That is truly frightening.Too many in positions of power disregard women and do not consider — or do not care — how their policy choices amplify those fears. In Missouri, these politicians have consistently attacked the availability of contraception and prenatal and postnatal care. Now, when a woman needs health care the most, following a rape, they have said no again.Women should be trusted to make their own health care decisions. In fact, it’s our constitutional right. Instead, we are subjected to extreme laws. It’s been happening for years, and it leaves all of us wondering what will come next. Considerations for the life and health of the mother could very well come under attack.
The governor and Republican lawmakers in Jefferson City have gone too far.I am not alone in feeling this way. In fact, Republicans, Democrats and independents in our state and across the nation are shocked by this law. This includes President Donald Trump, who came out in opposition to this cruel public policy of not making exceptions in the case of rape or incest.I’m frustrated to once again see Missouri portrayed this way, especially over an issue that is so personal to so many people.
Sometimes, the memories in the Capitol halls of Jefferson City are short. Even so, we all remember in 2012 when Todd Akin, the U.S. Senate nominee of the Republican Party, referred to “legitimate rape” and that a woman’s “body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down.” It made national headlines and was an embarrassment. Missourians refused to allow it.Missouri women need health care. Missouri families need to know they have access to the constitutional rights granted under Roe v. Wade.Instead, our state is once again at the forefront of extremism, because the governor is disrespecting women and delivering another dose of Akin. This time, it’s not just rhetoric, it’s the law.Nicole Galloway is the Missouri state auditor."
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"'Getting his sea legs back.'  After resigning from office, Greitens tries to steady his life — in private","Jun 2, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/getting-his-sea-legs-back-after-resigning-from-office-greitens/article_0b797d35-842b-56aa-ad2f-77f046890dd4.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — As governor, Eric Greitens was a secretive chief executive who worked hard to manage his own narrative by avoiding the press and appearing only in controlled settings.While that approach to governing melted under the heat of a scandal, it comes as no surprise the Republican has stayed off the radar in the year since he left office.No interviews. No public appearances. No news of his whereabouts.

But now, on the anniversary of Greitens’ departure, new information is beginning to seep out about Missouri’s 56th chief executive.For one, the Navy says the former Navy SEAL is making a return to the military, which he used as an asset during his 2016 campaign to become governor.Greitens, 45, is not going back into combat, but will serve as an officer in the Naval Reserve, a Navy information officer said.He’s also returned to writing, this time working on a book about his Jewish faith. It’s unclear whether he has a publisher lined up, and the former governor may have to answer for literary fraud accusations leveled against him in regard to his third book, “Resilience.”Through contacts with former employees of the governor’s office, the Post-Dispatch learned Greitens has hosted occasional cookouts at the $675,000 house he and his wife, University of Missouri political science professor Sheena Greitens, bought in the Warren County vacation town of Innsbrook after he became governor.“I think he’s doing well,” said former state Sen. John Lamping, a friend of Greitens. “I think it was a pretty crazy period and time. I know he’s spent most of the time just with his family, a lot of time out at Innsbrook.”Lamping says he hasn’t visited Innsbrook but said the two have met in between Innsbrook and Lamping’s home in Augusta. Lamping said Greitens hasn’t mentioned running for office again, but he said they do talk about the state of politics in Missouri.“He knows that I was pretty involved in trying to defeat this merger proposition,” Lamping said of the St. Louis-St. Louis County merger proposal known as Better Together. “We really just talk about that kind of stuff. He’s really just getting his sea legs back.”Rise, fall and aftermathGreitens’ entrance into the political scene in Missouri came in 2015. The political newcomer crafted a tough guy, outsider image to win his first race for office in the August 2016 Republican primary for governor.But in January 2018, news broke that Greitens had been having an affair at the same time he was launching his bid for office. Within five turbulent months, he would be gone.Greitens admitted he had an affair, but denied an allegation that he threatened the woman with a compromising photograph.Besides the affair, Greitens faced allegations of campaign finance violations, including using a charity donor list to raise campaign contributions — and then lying to the Missouri Ethics Commission about how he obtained the list.In announcing his resignation, Greitens said he did not deserve the onslaught: “I have not broken any laws or committed any offense worthy of this treatment.”Although it’s been a year since he left office on June 1, investigations continue related to his downfall.The Missouri Ethics Commission has not completed its report into a complaint filed by the chairman of the legislative investigatory panel. The complaint alleged multiple campaign finance violations.That has resulted in Greitens tapping his once formidable campaign fund for more than $1 million to pay teams of attorneys to defend him.Most of the campaign cash for attorneys went to the Husch Blackwell firm, where attorney Catherine Hanaway is a partner. Hanaway, who lost to Greitens in the 2016 GOP primary for governor, has represented Greitens in his various legal battles.Records show Greitens also continues to keep campaign aides on the payroll, including Scott Turk, who had been on the state payroll during a part of Greitens’ abbreviated 17 months in office.Gov. Mike Parson, the former lieutenant governor who succeeded Greitens, continues to defend the office in court against two Sunshine Law lawsuits related to Greitens’ time in office.Loose endsThe money in Greitens’ campaign fund is separate from a nonprofit that was formed after his election that raised almost $6.1 million from secret donors in 2017.The organization, known as A New Missouri, is a 501(c)(4) nonprofit that operated opaquely during Greitens’ abbreviated tenure. The organization does not appear to be active.Though the sources of the vast majority of the $6.1 million raised are unclear, the Center for Responsive Politics reported this month that A New Missouri received $500,000 from the Judicial Crisis Network, a secretive group that promotes conservative judges.Meanwhile, one of the targets of Greitens’ former legal defense team, St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kimberly Gardner, faces an investigation into how her office handled the prosecution of Greitens.
In mid-May, a special grand jury examining perjury allegations against an investigator hired by Gardner was extended for up to 60 days.The probe centers on William Don Tisaby, the private investigator Gardner picked to look into allegations against Greitens.The grand jury has been reviewing whether Tisaby deliberately lied during a deposition last year.Gardner’s office is still fighting in court over data stored on a Circuit Attorney’s Office server, which police seized April 29.The source of $120,000 in cash delivered to anti-Greitens attorney Albert Watkins is still unclear.Watkins represented the husband of Greitens’ ex-lover, and he disseminated transcripts of recorded conversations in which the woman described her affair with the future governor.Watkins said the money went toward his client’s legal bills, not to his client.“My client did not get a dime,” Watkins told the Post-Dispatch. “It went to pay attorneys fees.”Even the Navy has Greitens under a microscope.
On Friday, the Washington Post reported that the chief of naval operations, Adm. John Richardson, has called for a 30-day review of how the service handles personnel cases involving personal misconduct allegations, including Greitens’.In a May 26 email obtained by the Post, Richardson said Navy policies for addressing misconduct are “too cumbersome and slow” and the results could weaken “the ethical fiber of our Navy” and put the service “in a situation that is hard to explain to ourselves, and even more difficult to explain to the American people.”Staff moves onAfter the moving trucks pulled away from the Governor’s Mansion carrying the Greitens family’s possessions, the main core of his staff also exited their warren of offices on the Capitol’s second floor. Some went tearfully. Others said they were ready for a new, perhaps less stressful, chapter of their lives.His chief counsel, Lucinda Luetkemeyer, returned to private law practice. Her husband, Tony Luetkemeyer, was elected months later to a seat in the Missouri Senate.In her online biography, Luetkemeyer notes that she worked for the governor of Missouri, but doesn’t name Greitens as that governor.Greitens’ chief legislative aide, Will Scharf, left Missouri for a job in Washington.“While I was obviously disappointed with how our administration ended, serving the people of Missouri was a tremendous honor and privilege, and I am grateful to Gov. Greitens for giving me that opportunity,” Scharf said.Austin Chambers, a Georgia political operative who oversaw Greitens’ campaign for the seat and served as his political consultant after he was elected, is now the Republican State Leadership Committee president.In Chambers’ biography on the RSLC website, he lists a string of campaign victories, but also doesn’t use Greitens’ name.After departing as Greitens’ communications director, Parker Briden served as a spokesman for unsuccessful Nevada gubernatorial candidate Adam Laxalt. He is now spokesman for Mississippi Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves, who is running for governor there.Just a handful of staffers stuck around to work for Missouri’s current governor, Republican Mike Parson, who was sworn in the day Greitens left office.In taking over, Parson made it a mission to calm the waters in state government.Where Greitens openly fought with members of the General Assembly, Parson, a former lawmaker, sought to work with the Legislature to get his priorities passed into law.Despite multiple attempts over the past year, Greitens has not responded to interview requests from the Post-Dispatch.

Witness the most current example of our Missouri Legislature and Gov. Mike Parson garnering national headlines for making our wonderful state the poster child for a concerted attempt to overturn Roe v. Wade.

Although our state government has the chance to improve our sadly deteriorating roads, improve our schools by elevating teacher pay and pass a prescription drug monitoring law as one of the last states to do so, they choose instead to focus their time on issues that will give the citizens of our state the ignominious title of “Member, Gang of Women’s Rights Deniers of 2019.” What a choice.

I applaud Gov. Mike Parson; Sens. Ed Emery, Caleb Rowden, Tony Luetkemeyer and Dan Hegeman; as well as Reps. David Gregory, Nick Schroer, Glen Kolkmeyer and Rob Vescovo for championing these important efforts.Despite these successes, work remains to be done. The Legislature again failed to pass much-needed consumer protection reform, refusing to address the trial bar’s blatant abuses of the Missouri Merchandising Practices Act. Such reform was introduced five years ago, yet lawmakers continue to manufacture reasons for inaction. It is beyond dispute that cases come from all over the country to St. Louis because of lax venue rules and lucrative damages available under this act. Excessive tort costs in Missouri result in $1.6 billion in annual direct costs to the state’s economy.

The Legislature also failed to advance an asbestos trust transparency bill and punitive damages reform. The Missouri Association of Trial Attorneys lobbied against these efforts and the Senate succumbed to the pressure.
The governor has made it clear that civil justice reform is an important priority for his administration, yet he can only sign those bills sent to his desk. The onus falls on the Legislature to pass additional bills that will rid the state of its “show-me-your lawsuit” nickname and St. Louis’ status as a judicial hellhole.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Gov. Mike Parson ends first year in office facing onslaught from abortion rights activists,"Jun 1, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/gov-mike-parson-ends-first-year-in-office-facing-onslaught/article_739dcd19-63cb-5de9-962c-790ab4ca1237.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — Gov. Mike Parson signed an anti-abortion law on May 24, banning the procedure at eight weeks of pregnancy, except in medical emergencies.Controversy over the law, however, did not subside after he signed the law.Parson, a Republican, finished his first year in office on Saturday facing a public relations and legal onslaught from abortion-rights activists and Democrats who wield little to no power in Jefferson City.

The new abortion law has generated backlash in three ways: the ACLU of Missouri and GOP mega-donor David Humphreys have started parallel campaigns to repeal the law; opponents are expected to challenge the constitutionality of the law in court; and, politically, Democrats seek to translate anger among some constituencies into success at the polls.The measure has stirred unease among several Republicans, who worry about the popularity of strict abortion laws approved here and in other states.President Donald Trump recently broke with Missouri lawmakers, saying he supported abortion rights in cases of rape or incest, and Humphreys, who with his family spent $14 million on Republican causes during the 2016 election cycle, has also said the law goes too far.On another front, St. Louis Circuit Judge Michael Stelzer issued a temporary restraining order Friday blocking the state from revoking the license of the St. Louis Planned Parenthood clinic, handing a loss to the governor. On Wednesday Parson said such a court order would be “reckless.”On May 17, facing questions about why he would sign a bill without rape or incest exceptions, Parson predicted the courts would have the final say on the eight-week ban — not activists on both sides of the abortion issue.“I believe in the pro-life side of the issue,” Parson told reporters, later adding he believed all life had value, no matter how it was conceived.“There’s going to be challenges to this. You all know. This all started in 1973,” he said. “There’s going to be court challenges to this issue throughout the years to come.”That same day, activists chanted outside Parson’s Capitol office as House Republicans advanced the ban on abortions after eight-weeks. Once the bill was on Parson’s desk, they bombarded his office with phone calls and emails.

According to the governor’s office, roughly 3,000 calls and 1,600 emails related to the abortion law came into the office between May 16 and May 23.It was unclear how many contacts were in opposition, but, “typically, calls are made more in opposition,” spokesman Steele Shippy said of calls to the office on any given issue.Some activists said they couldn’t get through. Alison Dreith, deputy director at the Hope Clinic for Women in Granite City, said she tried calling three times but did not speak to a real person nor did she receive a voicemail prompt.“If Gov. Parson was not keeping track of people who supported or opposed this bill … now we will never know” how many people opposed the bill, she said.
On Thursday, with the bill already signed into law, activists confronted the governor as he stepped onto the elevator at the University Club Tower in Richmond Heights to film an episode of “This Week in Missouri Politics” with publisher Scott Faughn.Hundreds of other activists protested in downtown St. Louis, chanting near the governor’s St. Louis office, calling on him to resign. Police said Friday they arrested 16 protesters.

Planned Parenthood lawsuit
Fueling the activists’ fury was a separate Parson administration flare-up over abortion.On Tuesday, Planned Parenthood launched a media blitz — holding a mid-morning press call with national and local outlets to announce the organization’s St. Louis abortion clinic would likely be forced to cease abortions on Friday, the result of a licensing dispute between Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region and the state Department of Health and Senior Services.That morning, the group also filed a lawsuit accusing the state of illegally threatening renewal of the clinic’s license.“Just like the Trump administration and the state politicians they embolden, Missouri Governor Parson’s inspections process has become just another vehicle to intimidate doctors like me and to push abortion care out of reach for patients,” Dr. Colleen McNicholas, obstetrician-gynecologist at the St. Louis Planned Parenthood location, said in a statement.Parson held his own news conference the next afternoon, flanked by top advisers and Dr. Randall Williams, a licensed obstetrician and the director of the DHSS.“Yesterday Planned Parenthood filed a lawsuit against the state and (that) coincided with a media campaign by Planned Parenthood,” Parson said.Parson said the state health department found “a series of deficiencies” at the clinic.He did not elaborate, citing an ongoing investigation, but the DHSS later put out a news release saying concerns were initially raised after inspections in March.The agency cited “at least one incident in which patient safety was gravely compromised.” It also cited what it called “failed surgical abortions” in which women remained pregnant, and an alleged failure to obtain “informed consent.”The Associated Presscontributed to this report.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri's only abortion clinic stays open for now,"Jun 1, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/missouri-s-only-abortion-clinic-stays-open-for-now/article_f8be0cd2-83a3-5ee6-85eb-ae874b36e316.html,"ST. LOUIS — Missouri's only abortion clinic won a temporary reprieve in court on Friday, and may continue providing abortions for now, a St. Louis judge ruled.St. Louis Circuit Judge Michael Stelzer granted a request from Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region for a temporary restraining order that stopped the clinic's license from expiring at midnight on Friday. But Stelzer's ruling effectively extends the license for only a few days. He scheduled a hearing at 9 a.m. Tuesday for further debate.

Still, supporters were relieved. ""The fight goes on,"" Dr. Colleen McNicholas, an obstetrician-gynecologist at the St. Louis clinic, said in a statement. ""While temporary, we celebrate today, and tomorrow we go back to work to ensure access to abortion does not go dark at the last health center that provides abortion in Missouri.""The news disappointed some abortion opponents, but they remained hopeful. “It’s inevitable they’re going to lose,” said Rita Frances Ward. “Because God wins.”Stelzer's order comes a day after hearing arguments over Planned Parenthood's future here, and a week after Gov. Mike Parson signed one of the nation's strictest abortion laws. The two events have together turned the nation's attention on Missouri, one of several states to pass stricter abortion laws. Activists on both sides protested in St. Louis on Thursday and Friday. Police arrested sixteen abortion-rights advocates Thursday after a protest spilled into the Wainwright building downtown. On Friday, abortion opponents gathered in front of Planned Parenthood's Central West End clinic, 4251 Forest Park Avenue.












        

        
            Michael Stelzer's order in Planned Parenthood case





Last Friday, Parson signed the law prohibiting most abortions eight weeks into a pregnancy. It takes effect Aug. 28.On Tuesday, Planned Parenthood sued the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services, alleging the state agency was illegally refusing to renew the St. Louis abortion clinic's yearly license until the department could complete an investigation into an unspecified patient complaint.The legal fight stems from the state's Department of Health and Human Services' request to interview seven physicians, all of whom had worked at the clinic, as part of the investigation. Five of the doctors, who aren't employed by Planned Parenthood but come from local university medical programs to treat patients at the clinic, have refused to be interviewed as part of the state's investigation.Planned Parenthood said it has no power to compel those doctors to speak to the department about the investigation, which began in April after a routine inspection a month earlier. The clinic said the March 11-13 inspection included interviews with doctors and staff and cited some ""non-remarkable"" deficiencies — such as failing to ensure all staff participated in a fire drill. The inspection also cited Planned Parenthood for the timing of a pelvic exam and the clinic's failure to ensure that the same doctor who provided an ""informed consent visit"" three days before an abortion was also the one performing the procedure. The clinic says it submitted a correction plan as required.
A lawyer for DHSS argued Thursday that the doctors' refusal to be interviewed as part of the investigation is ""unprecedented"" and that the clinic has the burden of forcing the physicians to cooperate. He said it is common to seek interviews with people who work in health care facilities as part of the license renewal process.On Friday, Stelzer said he was not ruling on the merits of the controversy. The state argued that there was ""no prospect"" it would decide whether to renew the clinic's license before midnight Friday.""Petitioner has demonstrated that immediate and irreparable injury will result if petitioner's license is allowed to expire,"" Stelzer wrote.
About 60 abortion opponents protested on Friday outside Planned Parenthood, hoping Stelzer would side with the state. Some carried “Choose Life” signs. Others prayed the rosary. Some hoped to deter women coming in for abortions.Every few minutes, cars on Forest Park Avenue honked loudly in support. One driver cheered as she waited at a stoplight.“It’s electric,” said Kathy Forck of New Bloomfield, Mo. “You can feel the excitement in the air. We can hardly wait.”But by the early afternoon, news of Stelzer's decision had reached the clinic sidewalk.A handful of abortion-rights supporters counter-protesting a few feet away erupted in high-fives and celebration, nearly drowning out Ward, the abortion opponent, who was singing the third verse of “Amazing Grace” into a microphone.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Don't remove health care from vulnerable residents,"May 31, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/mailbag/don-t-remove-health-care-from-vulnerable-residents/article_207d745d-6799-5216-a418-fcf1e3a6eaa8.html,"Regarding ""Revelations cast doubt on Missouri's claim that 'improved economy' shrunk Medicaid rolls"" (April 26): Imagine that your child is sick. You are under the impression you have health insurance and go to the doctor, only to learn you have lost that insurance with no notice. You are forced to choose between a sick child and a huge medical bill. This is what’s happening to tens of thousands of Missourians.A disturbing 85,000 Missourians and counting have lost Medicaid benefits since January 2018. About 67,000 are children. Families on Medicaid are among the most vulnerable Missourians and should be protected.

Though Gov. Mike Parson's administration has claimed that an improving economy has resulted in fewer people needing Medicaid, the reality is that bureaucratic hurdles have prevented their paperwork from being properly processed. They have lost care because Medicaid data is not being handled in compliance with federal law, not because people are suddenly able to access private health insurance.
It will fall to others to pay for whatever money Parson claims to be in the budget because his administration has forced people off benefits. When uninsured Missourians are unable to access preventive care, they are instead forced go to an emergency room when they become acutely sick. On top of the exorbitant costs of these visits, Parson’s policy will lead to sicker children.
The governor must re-enroll everyone who lost Medicaid benefits to prevent more Missourians and their children from losing life-saving coverage.Rachel Grand • St. Louis"

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,GOP mega-donor David Humphreys endorses effort to overturn Missouri abortion law,"May 31, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/gop-mega-donor-david-humphreys-endorses-effort-to-overturn-missouri/article_5042b028-f598-58a8-8f43-a8be7f659eca.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — Republican mega-donor David Humphreys on Friday endorsed an effort to overturn an anti-abortion law Gov. Mike Parson signed last week.Parson, also a Republican, signed House Bill 126 last Friday. The law takes effect Aug. 28 and bans abortions at eight weeks of pregnancy, except when there is a medical emergency. There are no exceptions allowing abortions in cases of rape or incest.Humphreys endorsed the Committee to Protect the Rights of Victims of Rape and Incest. As of Friday, there were no records on the Missouri Ethics Commission's website showing the group had filed any registration paperwork.

Attorney Lowell Pearson, who often represents Republican clients, filed two questions with the secretary of state's office Friday. Both seek a public referendum on the abortion law in November 2020.""I support the Committee’s referendum petition to overturn HB126,"" Humphreys said in a statement. ""Abortion is (a) very personal subject with complicated moral issues for all involved. With no consideration given to victims of rape and incest, this legislation’s impact reflects bad public policy with negative consequences for Missourians. As such, I support the Committee’s effort to protect women in the case of rape or incest. ""I invite other like-minded people to join in the Committee’s efforts and with financial and personal support of its signature gathering and campaign,"" he said.Sara Baker, legislative director for the ACLU of Missouri, said Humphreys' effort was separate from the ACLU's. On Tuesday, the ACLU filed its own referendum with the same end goal of convincing voters to veto the law.
""They are filing their own referendum,"" she said.To place a question on the ballot, proponents of either effort will have to collect more than 100,000 signatures around the state by Aug. 28 to stop the law from going into effect.The legislation Parson signed also bans a woman from aborting a fetus that might have Down syndrome. It requires both parents or guardians to be notified before minors can get an abortion, in most cases.
The measure says anyone “who knowingly performs or induces an abortion” in cases that are not exempted by the legislation would be guilty of a Class B felony, which carries a minimum five-year prison sentence.If the Supreme Court overturns Roe vs. Wade, “in whole or in part,” the legislation states that all abortions would be made illegal except in cases of a medical emergency.Humphreys, whose Tamko Building Products makes roofing shingles, has funneled millions of dollars toward GOP causes in recent years, including to the election of U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley and to the House Republican fundraising arm.During the 2016 election cycle, Humphreys and his family contributed more than $14 million to Republicans.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Despite pollution concerns, Missouri governor OKs law stopping counties from regulating farms","May 31, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/despite-pollution-concerns-missouri-governor-oks-law-stopping-counties-from/article_c8279aee-6cfe-510b-a633-f1aeeb2500ad.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — Over the objections of environmental groups and Democrats, Gov. Mike Parson quietly signed Friday a measure stopping local governments from regulating big farms.The legislation, which was the focus of a 12-hour, overnight filibuster in the Missouri Senate this spring, will bar counties from imposing their own pollution-fighting rules on concentrated animal feeding operations, known as CAFOs.The signing came as Parson, who also owns a cattle operation in his hometown of Bolivar, spent the week observing “beef month” with leaders of the Missouri Cattlemen’s Association.

Twenty counties, mostly in the northern half of the state, have sought to regulate large animal operations through local health ordinances. But the new law says counties cannot enact rules more stringent than state standards.Proponents say the local ordinances create a “hodgepodge” of regulations that have stalled expansion of modern agriculture techniques in the state.But opponents — flanked by a vocal statewide network of neighbors affected by the facilities — have said state regulations are lacking, allowing the big farms to run amok and endanger the environment.Passage of the legislation earlier this month came after thousands of Missourians called on lawmakers to drop the legislation.Brian Smith of the Missouri Rural Crisis Center said counties enacted their own rules because state regulators lack the power to protect citizens.“Legislators in Jefferson City and the governor heard loud and clear that the vast majority of Missourians were opposed to Senate Bill 391, yet they chose to side with corporate interests over rural communities,” Smith said after the legislation was approved.
Parson, during a news conference May 17, defended the state’s standards and the Department of Natural Resource’s ability to regulate the large operations.“I’m confident that DNR can handle that to make sure that’s done,” he said. “We’re going to make sure the environment’s protected; we’re going to make sure people’s rights are protected.”Democrats did win a concession during their filibuster: setback requirements for what are known as “export only” CAFOs — operations that ship manure to other farms.
The Democrats were concerned that owners could spray anywhere, with no safeguards for streams or public lands. Some farms near CAFOs welcome the manure, which is a fertilizer that can be offered for free.Parson will highlight the new law when he attends an annual steak fry in Sedalia hosted by the Missouri Cattlemen’s Association on June 9.“We’ve now opened the doors that will allow Missouri to lead the way in meeting a growing world food demand and ensure we keep more agriculture production in our state, strengthening Missouri’s number one industry,” the governor said in a statement Friday.A coalition of farm groups also has praised the law, saying uniform regulations will provide certainty to farmers and ranchers throughout Missouri.“This bill will ensure we use the latest science so that our animals are raised in healthy environments and our water and air remain clean. Missouri farms should be governed by science-based rules and expert oversight, not reactionary fear mongering,” the statement noted.The legislation is Senate Bill 391.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Police arrested 16 on Thursday after pro-choice rally in downtown St. Louis,"May 31, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/police-arrested-on-thursday-after-pro-choice-rally-in-downtown/article_946f023a-a335-5459-8329-898e0df84c22.html,"Updated at 10:40 a.m. Friday with arrest details.  ST. LOUIS — Police arrested Alderman Megan Ellyia Green and several board members of Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region on Thursday after a downtown protest over Missouri's new abortion law — and the state's attempt to close Missouri's only remaining abortion clinic.Green and others sat down in the lobby of the Wainwright State Office Building after a protest in a park between the Gateway Arch and the historic Old Courthouse.

By the time the bulk of the protesters had marched from the park, Green and the others were seated in the lobby of the Wainwright building and security guards had barred and locked the doors.Green livestreamed on Facebook as protesters inside chanted, sang and vowed not to leave until the Planned Parenthood clinic was given a permit to operate.Outside, a larger group chanted slogans, including, ""Hey hey, ho ho, Parson has got to go,” referring to Gov. Mike Parson, who on Friday, signed a bill prohibiting most abortions after eight weeks. Parson has offices in the building.Police ordered protesters out, and began arresting them one by one at about 2:30 p.m. About a dozen were placed in two police transport vans as protesters cheered, clapped and chanted.
Police said on Friday that they arrested 16 for trespassing. Two were issued summons and released and 14 were booked. The protest began about an hour after the start of a 10:30 a.m. hearing in St. Louis Circuit Court in a lawsuit seeking to block the expiration of Planned Parenthood's license. The group sued Tuesday, claiming the state was illegally refusing to reissue that license. A judge did not  rule in the case.Protest organizers could not immediately provide a list of those arrested, but among them were Joan Bray, a former state senator and representative, and Planned Parenthood board members Dana Sandweiss and Maureen Michel Jordan. Sandweiss is also on the board of the ACLU.
On Facebook, Jordan said she was engaging in an act of civil disobedience and cited a friend's botched abortion in 1969.A police spokesman could not immediately provide information on the arrests or the potential charges.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Battle over abortion in Missouri intensifies with arrests and court fight,"May 31, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/battle-over-abortion-in-missouri-intensifies-with-arrests-and-court/article_bb641898-b178-5013-921c-272af70ed8a0.html,"ST. LOUIS — The battle over abortion in Missouri intensified on Thursday, first in a courtroom, and then under the Gateway Arch.A St. Louis judge heard arguments Thursday morning from lawyers for Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region and the state of Missouri over the future of the state's only abortion clinic. Planned Parenthood is asking for a temporary order that would prevent the state from allowing the clinic's license to expire at midnight Friday.Judge Michael Stelzer's decision, expected Friday, could determine whether Missouri becomes the nation's first state without a functioning abortion clinic.

""Missouri politicians and Missouri government are weaponizing the licensing and regulatory process to end safe and legal abortions in Missouri,"" M’Evie Mead, the director of Planned Parenthood Advocates of Missouri, said on the courthouse steps after the hearing.Meanwhile, hundreds began gathering just a few blocks away at a park in front of the Arch, to protest Missouri Gov. Mike Parson's signing last week of one of the country's most restrictive abortion laws. Some marched from the park to the lobby of the Wainwright building, where Parson has an office, and refused to leave.Police arrested about a dozen, including St. Louis Alderman Megan Ellyia Green, former State Senator Joan Bray, and several Planned Parenthood board members.Planned Parenthood sued the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services on Tuesday, alleging the state agency was illegally refusing to renew the St. Louis abortion clinic's yearly license until the department could complete an investigation into an unspecified patient complaint.At issue is the state's demand to interview seven physicians, all of whom had worked at the clinic, as part of an investigation the clinic says began last month. Five of the doctors, who aren't employed by Planned Parenthood but come from local university medical programs to treat patients at the Central West End clinic, have refused to be interviewed as part of the state's investigation.The clinic's lawyer, Jamie Boyer, argued Thursday that it has no power to compel those doctors to speak to the department about the investigation, which began in April after a routine inspection a month earlier. The clinic said the March 11-13 inspection included interviews with doctors and staff and cited some ""non-remarkable"" deficiencies that the clinic says it corrected.The inspection cited Planned Parenthood for the timing of a pelvic exam and the clinic's failure to ensure that the same doctor who provided an ""informed consent visit"" three days before an abortion was also the one performing it. The clinic says it submitted a correction plan as required.""There is no justification for shutting our doors now,"" Boyer told the judge. ""The department is conditioning our ability to renew our license on these interviews. We couldn't comply even if we wanted to. They're not our employees.""John Sauer, a lawyer for DHSS, argued Thursday that the doctors' refusal to be interviewed as part of the investigation is ""unprecedented"" and that the clinic has the burden of forcing the physicians to cooperate. He said it is common to seek interviews with people who work in health care facilities as part of the license renewal process.""We've raised serious concerns that need to be addressed,"" Sauer said of the department's investigation.The impasse between the state and Planned Parenthood, Sauer said, was ""created by the refusal of the doctors to cooperate and the failure of the regulated entity to induce them to cooperate."" He also said Planned Parenthood shouldn't have sued — its complaints should have been heard by a license renewal commission instead of state courts.
On Friday, Parson signed a law prohibiting most abortions eight weeks into a pregnancy. The law takes effect Aug. 28.The Republican governor said during a press conference Wednesday that in addition to not enabling interviews, Planned Parenthood had not corrected several ""deficiencies"" at the St. Louis clinic. He declined to elaborate.Mead, the Planned Parenthood director, said the organization has complied with state's ""goalpost-moving behavior.""Stelzer's decision is expected before midnight Friday. He'll weigh whether DHSS's interpretation of Missouri rules for renewing licenses conflicts with state law as well as whether the state's failure to renew Planned Parenthood's license interferes with a woman's constitutional right to an abortion.
The protests started just after 11:30 a.m. Thursday. Protesters marched west from the Arch down Market Street, leading chants and calling for Parson's removal from office. Some crowded the lobby of the Wainwright building, which holds state offices, vowing to stay until Planned Parenthood's license was renewed. Alderman Green livestreamed the event on Facebook.Police ordered them out and began arresting them one by one at about 2:30 p.m. They were placed into two police transport vans as protesters outside cheered, clapped and chanted.Protest organizers could not immediately provide a list of those arrested, but among them were Planned Parenthood board members Dana Sandweiss and Maureen Michel Jordan.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,License of Missouri's only abortion clinic in St. Louis judge's hands,"May 30, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/license-of-missouri-s-only-abortion-clinic-in-st-louis/article_6733d111-80de-50a4-92af-64fa965f54ce.html,"ST. LOUIS — Missouri's only abortion clinic's fight to keep its doors open rests with one man: Michael Stelzer.On Thursday, the St. Louis judge heard arguments from lawyers for Planned Parenthood and the state of Missouri over the clinic's future. The clinic is asking for a temporary order that would prevent its license from expiring at midnight Friday.













St. Louis Circuit Judge Michael Stelzer




Stelzer took the case under advisement and has yet to make a ruling. His decision could determine whether Missouri becomes the nation's first state without at least one functioning abortion clinic.The legal fight in St. Louis comes within a week of the Missouri governor signing one of the country's most restrictive abortion laws.Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region sued the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services on Tuesday, alleging the state agency was illegally refusing to renew the St. Louis abortion clinic's yearly license until the department could complete an investigation into an unspecified patient complaint.At issue is the state's demand to interview seven physicians, all who had worked at the clinic, as part of an investigation the clinic says began last month. Five of the doctors, who aren't employed by Planned Parenthood but come from local university medical programs to treat patients at the Central West End clinic, have refused to be interviewed as part of the state's investigation.

The clinic's lawyer, Jamie Boyer, argued Thursday that it has no power to compel those doctors to speak to the department about an unspecified investigation, which began in April after a routine inspection a month earlier. The clinic said the March 11-13 inspection included interviews with doctors and staff and cited some ""non-remarkable"" deficiencies that the clinic says it corrected.The inspection cited Planned Parenthood for the timing of a pelvic exam and the clinic's failure to ensure that the same doctor who provided an ""informed consent visit"" three days before the abortion was the one performing it. The clinic says it submitted a correction plan as required.""There is no justification for shutting our doors now,"" Boyer told the judge. ""The department is conditioning our ability to renew our license on these interviews. We couldn't comply even if we wanted to. They're not our employees.""John Sauer, a lawyer for DHSS argued Thursday that the doctors' refusal to be interviewed as part of the investigation is ""unprecedented"" and that the clinic has the burden of forcing the physicians to cooperate. He said it is common to seek interviews with people who work in health-care facilities as part of the license renewal process.
""We've raised serious concerns that need to be addressed,"" Sauer said of the department's investigation.The impasse between the the state and Planned Parenthood, Sauer said, was ""created by the refusal of the doctors to cooperate and the failure of the regulated entity to induce them to cooperate."" He also said Planned Parenthood shouldn't have sued — its complaints should have been heard by a license renewal commission instead of state courts.On Friday, Gov. Mike Parson signed a new anti-abortion law prohibiting most abortions eight weeks into a pregnancy. The eight-week abortion ban takes effect Aug. 28.The Republican governor said during a press conference Wednesday that in addition to not enabling interviews, Planned Parenthood had not corrected several ""deficiencies"" at the St. Louis clinic. He declining to elaborate.
After Thursday's hearing on the courthouse steps, M’Evie Mead, the director of Planned Parenthood Advocates of Missouri, said the organization has complied with state's ""goalpost-moving behavior.""""Missouri politicians and Missouri government are weaponizing the licensing and regulatory process to end safe and legal abortions in Missouri,"" Mead said.Stelzer's decision is expected before midnight Friday. He'll weigh whether DHSS's interpretation of Missouri rules for renewing licenses conflicts with state law and if the state's failure to renew Planned Parenthood's license interferes with a woman's constitutional right to an abortion.In downtown St. Louis on Thursday, protesters against Missouri's new abortion law marched from the Gateway Arch west on Market Street, leading chants and calling for Parson's removal from office. Some crowded the lobby of the Wainwright Building, which holds state offices, vowing to stay until Planned Parenthood's license is renewed. Police arrested several protesters about 2:30 p.m.— Robert Patrick of the Post-Dispatch contributed to this report.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"In run-up to 2020, Parson fundraising haul outpacing 2016 candidates","May 30, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/in-run-up-to-parson-fundraising-haul-outpacing-candidates/article_8c3a4fe5-f835-56c4-9065-18e6f99a166b.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — When it comes to collecting the campaign cash needed to make a run for governor in 2020, Gov. Mike Parson is outpacing the group of Republicans who sought the seat in 2016.With more than $3 million spread across two campaign accounts, Parson is ahead of where the four GOP candidates for governor stood at the same time in 2015.Former Missouri House Speaker Catherine Hanaway had the most in her account at $1.2 million with 14 months to go before voters headed to the polls in 2016, according to Missouri Ethics Commission records. Businessman John Brunner, former Lt. Gov. Peter Kinder and eventual nominee Eric Greitens each had under $1 million in their campaign war chests.

“I am pleased with the progress of the fundraising at this point,” said John Hancock, a former Missouri Republican Party chief who is spearheading fundraising for Parson. “I would like to see us ramp things up in the next quarter, but overall I am pleased.”Parson has not announced whether he will run for a full term as he closes out his first year as chief executive after taking over for the scandal-plagued Greitens.But, in a sign he and his supporters are ramping up their fundraising to make a bid for a full four years, his campaign accounts have collected at least $250,000 since May 1.On Wednesday, his political action committee Uniting Missouri reported $165,000 in contributions from a fundraiser co-sponsored by lobbyist and former Missouri House Speaker Steve Tilley.Tilley represents a number of companies seeking licenses and contracts to operate in Missouri’s new medical marijuana program. The Parson administration is in the midst of reviewing contracts and writing rules for the program.
Other donors were Sterling Bancshares of Poplar Bluff and MACO Development Company of Clarkton. Each are involved in the low-income housing development tax credit business.Greitens put the tax credits on hold, arguing they’d become a cash cow for developers. Parson could restart the program after lawmakers failed to send him any of the reforms he’d sought.
Other donors in May include Anheuser-Busch and W.G. Wade Shows, which holds the contract to provide carnival rides at the Missouri State Fair in Sedalia.Wade Shows, which contributed $15,000 to Uniting Missouri on May 21, is among two companies that have held the contract to provide rides at the fair for the past 12 years. The Florida-based company has three more years left on the contract.Sami Jo Freeman, a spokeswoman for the Missouri Department of Agriculture said the fair does not pay the companies to provide the carnival rides.“In fact, the fair is contracted to receive a percentage of the ride sales and a flat rate for games-concession sales,” Freeman said.The campaign fund could grow more after a planned fundraiser in the St. Louis area Thursday night.Among Democrats potentially seeking the state’s top job, Sen. Scott Sifton of Affton reported having $313,000 on hand as of April 1. Auditor Nicole Galloway has $65,798 in her account after raising $114,194 in the first quarter. Neither has formally announced their future political plans.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,'I'm not sure if ego is involved or what': Democratic feud brewing in St. Louis County,"May 30, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/i-m-not-sure-if-ego-is-involved-or-what/article_413d3b91-09a2-592e-9502-dcfe09926932.html,"ST. LOUIS COUNTY — Mark Osmack wants to represent a Missouri Senate district that stretches from Glendale to Ellisville. So does state Rep. Deb Lavender, a Kirkwood Democrat.Osmack, also a Democrat from Kirkwood, said he announced his candidacy on May 21 after Lavender assured him she would not run. But this week, Lavender changed her mind. Osmack says she broke her promise to stay out of the race. And he isn’t happy about it.“This is all of her making, so I’m not sure if ego is involved or what,” Osmack told the Post-Dispatch.

He said Lavender informed him of her decision on Memorial Day — a holiday revered by Osmack, who is an Army veteran.“She told me this on Memorial Day,” he said. “And I’m a veteran and I’ve lost friends in Afghanistan and Iraq. Bad move. You want to talk about tone deaf, you want to talk about not being aware of the issues that really matter, that’s how you show it.”Lavender said she apologized to Osmack for changing her mind, but declined to comment further on the dispute. She could serve one more term in the House before being forced out by term limits, but decided to run for the Senate.“I have struggled with that decision for the last week and a half,” Lavender said. “I have until very recently been content to finish up my four terms in the House.”She said the passage of an anti-abortion bill supported by Sen. Andrew Koenig, R-Manchester, made her realize “how extreme my state senator is.”With two Democrats running in the 15th Senate District, the August 2020 primary will decide which candidate will face Koenig in the November election.The district is one of only a couple that Democrats acknowledge they could conceivably flip from Republican control next year, because of a suburban electorate that has warmed to Democrats in the last several election cycles.The district boundary is roughly Glendale to the east, Ellisville to the west and Ballwin to the north, with the southern boundary running along the southern St. Louis County line.When asked why Democrats should choose Osmack, 37, over Lavender, he said: “One, I’m a veteran. We have no Democratic veterans in the state Senate. … We also need new direction as a party. Democrats are outnumbered 3-1. Their game plan hasn’t worked, and if we don’t change it’s not going to work.“We do have the name ID because I ran for Congress last year,” Osmack said. “She is known in Kirkwood. I think she’s retired, I don’t know, but she’s in her 60s. I think a new brand of leadership that is young, energetic, vibrant is needed.”
Lavender, 62, is a physical therapist who runs her own practice on Manchester Road. She is not retired.After this article was published online Thursday, Osmack called a reporter and said he didn’t mean to denigrate Lavender’s age, and added that he regretted those comments.When asked why she felt she was the best Democrat, Lavender said: “I think I have a proven track record of working hard for a campaign, being able to raise money and have proven my leadership in the House in this position working for the people of Missouri.”
Lavender has hoofed her Kirkwood-based district for more than a decade. She first ran for the Missouri House in 2008, losing three times before finally winning the previously Republican-held 90th House District in 2014.In 2016, she easily defeated her GOP opponent, winning nearly 57% of the vote. No Republican ran against her in 2018, a likely reflection of the shifting politics of suburban areas like Kirkwood, and Lavender’s name recognition and popularity within her district.Osmack ran for Congress last year, placing second in a crowded Democratic primary for the 2nd Congressional District.Lavender and Osmack are seeking to paint Koenig as too “extreme” for the district. Koenig, 36, helped shepherd the anti-abortion law Gov. Mike Parson signed last week.Koenig is a member of the six-member Senate Conservative Caucus, which sought to stymie much of Parson’s agenda this past legislative session. The group embarked on a 27-hour filibuster in a failed effort to derail a package of incentives for General Motors’ Wentzville plant.Parson’s plan included other “workforce development” tools, including a new $10 million scholarship program.Koenig, in an interview, said he had worked on issues like foster care and said he opposed “corporate welfare.” He said issues such as these appeal to most voters.And, Koenig said he was not too extreme. But, he suggested Osmack was. (The interview took place before Lavender’s candidacy was confirmed.)“I think my opponent, Osmack — although I haven’t heard a lot from him — he’s probably going to be more extreme — on the left side — than what my district would represent,” Koenig said.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Hearing on the fate of St. Louis abortion clinic postponed until Thursday,"May 30, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/hearing-on-the-fate-of-st-louis-abortion-clinic-postponed/article_8ac3b4d5-9434-5135-84d6-5465bb51f12a.html,"Attorneys for Planned Parenthood and the state of Missouri had been scheduled to meet in court Wednesday afternoon in a dispute that will likely determine the fate of the state's only licensed abortion clinic.But, Circuit Judge Michael Stelzer said in open court, a hearing on the case had been postponed until 10:30 a.m. Thursday.""Due to facts out of everybody's control here, this case will be given a brief continuance,"" Stelzer said.

Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region sued the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services on Tuesday, alleging the state agency was ""unlawfully"" holding up renewal of the St. Louis abortion clinic's license until the department could finish an investigation into an unidentified patient complaint.The clinic, in the Central West End, will see its license expire on May 31 unless the state relents and renews the license, or the court intervenes.If the clinic stops performing abortions after Friday, Missouri will be the only state in the country without at least one abortion clinic, according to Planned Parenthood officials.














        
            Planned Parenthood lawsuit




DHSS, as part of its complaint investigation, is seeking to interview several physicians who had worked at the clinic, even though most of the physicians are not employed by Planned Parenthood, the lawsuit says.The clinic argues in the suit that it has no power to compel those physicians to speak to the department.On Friday, Gov. Mike Parson signed one of the most restrictive abortion laws in the country. Most of the law's provisions — including one prohibiting most abortions eight weeks into a pregnancy — do not take effect until Aug. 28.
Parson, a Republican, told reporters on Wednesday that in addition to not arranging interviews, Planned Parenthood had not corrected several ""deficiencies"" at the St. Louis clinic, declining to elaborate.""They still have two more days to comply,"" Parson said. ""They've got to answer for the deficiencies to the Department of Health.""Planned Parenthood, in its lawsuit, contends it has addressed all of the state's concerns.Joel Currier of the Post-Dispatch contributed to this report.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Editorial: Missouri's latest attack on abortion rights is a reminder: Elections have consequences.,"May 29, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-missouri-s-latest-attack-on-abortion-rights-is-a/article_53fe3bc4-1adb-54dc-9437-d2a4957a860a.html,"The ink was barely dry on Missouri’s draconian new anti-abortion-rights law before state regulators delivered the second blow against women’s control over their own bodies. Using — and blatantly abusing — their official licensing powers, regulators are threatening to shut down the last abortion provider in Missouri when its license expires Friday.Contrast that with Illinois, where Democrats control state government: In response to the coordinated attacks on women’s self-determination in Missouri and other red states, the Illinois Legislature is moving to shore up those rights.The difference confirms the axiom that elections have consequences. In Missouri, low-income women, rape victims and others who are targeted in these new forced-birth policies are facing the consequences of voters allowing the reactionary right to take over the state.

The Missouri law that Republican Gov. Mike Parson signed Friday outlaws all abortions after eight weeks — when many women don’t yet know they’re pregnant — with the exception of abortions to save the life of the mother. There are no rape or incest exceptions.It’s one of a recent series of laws in red states that blatantly violate the abortion-rights protections under Roe v. Wade. That’s the whole point: Anti-choice activists hope the inevitable court challenges will get them before today’s conservative U.S. Supreme Court, with possibility of overturning Roe.But Missouri’s state health regulators, apparently unwilling to wait for that national showdown, have now maneuvered to shut down the Planned Parenthood clinic in St. Louis — the last abortion provider in the state — with intimidation tactics that make a mockery of American democratic traditions.
As part of Planned Parenthood’s license-renewal process, the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services, which answers to Parson, is suddenly demanding interviews with doctors and others on staff, while making clear those interviews could lead to criminal proceedings or board review for the doctors. The obvious goal is to intimidate Planned Parenthood into refusing the interviews — which it has — so it can be denied its license renewal on Friday. Litigation is pending.It’s bad enough that politicians are writing laws to undercut women’s rights to their own medical decisions, but now bureaucrats controlled by those politicians are misusing their regulatory power to go beyond even what these new laws would allow.
All of this, remember, is in service to one ultimate goal: To ensure that any woman who becomes pregnant, even via rape, can be forced by the government to carry the pregnancy to term.Missouri voters in recent elections have handed their state over to an increasingly extremist party with which they disagree (judging from recent ballot measures) on the minimum wage, political ethics, organized labor and other issues. Now, elected extremists are attacking the fundamental biological rights of half the population.Elections have consequences. Missourians should remember that next year."
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"With $5 million contract at stake, Missouri issues conflicting medical marijuana rules","May 29, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/with-million-contract-at-stake-missouri-issues-conflicting-medical-marijuana/article_c2968508-fe49-5b36-81d6-81ba98692d73.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — In a decision that could trigger a legal challenge, Gov. Mike Parson’s administration is sending conflicting messages about how the state plans to manage a $5 million medical marijuana contract.Despite a ruling from one state agency that would ban a money-making practice by a medical marijuana contractor, Missouri’s health department has issued a set of rules that would allow companies to charge separate fees to pot dispensaries and growers.The opposing decisions were issued last week, just four days apart and could become the grounds for a lawsuit.

Voters approved Amendment 2 in November, making Missouri the 33rd state to legalize marijuana for medicinal use. Sales are to start early next year. Tax proceeds and licensing fees are supposed to go into a newly created veterans health care fund, which is expected to generate about $20 million per year.In some states, different companies handle the various aspects of operating a medical marijuana program. But Missouri wants one company to do most of the information technology set-up for its licensing and tracking system.In separate decisions issued last week, the state’s Office of Administration said it was denying protests by losing bidders, which argued the state should not have awarded a contract to a competitor in April because it could contain hidden costs.One of the losing companies, BioTrack, suggested Metrc, which won the contract, was able to submit a lower bid to the state because it would charge additional fees to growers and dispensaries.In rejecting the protest, the state said its contract with Metrc does not allow the company to charge additional fees.
But four days later, the Department of Health and Senior Services appeared to ignore that ruling when it issued a set of emergency rules that will govern the roll out of the program.“Unless otherwise addressed or prohibited by contract or law, an entity holding a contract with the state of Missouri for a statewide track and trace system and any affiliates of that entity may charge a price to a licensed or certified facility for plant/product tracking labels,” the rule said.
In response to the new rules, BioTrack attorney Chuck Hatfield is asking the Secretary of State’s office to put a halt to the health department’s decision to issue the rules.“DHSS has introduced substantial uncertainty by issuing an emergency rule that appears to permit Metrc to do exactly what OA said it could not,” Hatfield wrote in a letter to a lawyer for Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft.The Department of Health and Senior Services did not immediately respond to a request for comment.BioTrack and Metrc are among the top operators vying to help states administer their marijuana programs. Metrc has contracts with at least 10 states, while BioTrack has seven.Missouri is required by law to approve at least 60 commercial growers, 86 facilities that manufacture marijuana-infused products and 192 dispensary licenses — 24 dispensaries for each of Missouri’s eight congressional districts.The St. Louis area will probably have more than 48 dispensaries. Two congressional districts cover St. Louis and St. Louis County and parts of St. Charles, Jefferson and Franklin counties.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Governor's Mansion in Missouri in line for long-awaited repairs,"May 29, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/governor-s-mansion-in-missouri-in-line-for-long-awaited/article_ccd424e4-8338-5805-9b79-c46d72a667be.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — Just a year after moving into the governor’s mansion, Republican Mike Parson is poised to depart the capital city landmark.The move, however, is temporary as workers embark on a $3.3 million renovation project that will upgrade the heating and cooling system, fix longstanding plumbing problems and restore interior surfaces.That means new digs for Parson and his wife, Theresa, when they are in town.

Beginning on June 10, they will move into existing housing at the Missouri National Guard compound east of Jefferson City. While the housing unit is perched above the Missouri River like the mansion, it is not within walking distance of the Capitol building.Repairs to the mansion follow a 2016 report that noted the 147-year-old home needs upward of $4.3 million in repairs, including replacement of columns on the home’s sun porch, electrical upgrades, and replacement of the heating and cooling system.The report said all repairs could be made in one year if the governor and his family were to live somewhere else.According to the briefing paper, the interior plaster, paint and flooring of the mansion need to be repaired at an estimated cost of $500,000.“This is a necessary project as the interior plaster on the first floor is flaking and falling,” the document says. “In addition, the existing paint is lead-based and would require a hazardous remediation project. While this work would be occurring, it would be necessary for the family to not be in the residence.”The three-story brick building was first occupied by Gov. Benjamin Gratz Brown in 1872. The first floor includes a 17-foot-high Great Hall, two parlors, a library and a divided dining room. It has 13 bedrooms on the second and third floors.
Parson’s move to a temporary home is similar to what former Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner did in 2015 when the mansion in Springfield was shuttered for $15 million in renovations and upgrades.Rauner and his wife, Diana, lived in a house on the Illinois State Fairgrounds when they were in the capital city.Unlike Illinois, the money paying for the repairs is not from private sources, but from a bond issue the state conducted in 2014. Parson was the sponsor of the legislation.
Some work has already been completed, including the replacement of boilers in the basement.The heating and cooling system will be the biggest undertaking in the project. The mansion has multiple systems installed between 1965 and 2008 that are not integrated between 1965 and 2008.That has left some parts of the building more humid than others, resulting in water damage in some areas of the house, including the first-floor parlor.Pipes that have rusted and clogged and caused damage to walls and floors also will be replaced.Other work includes upgrades to electrical service and fire alarm systems. An exterior fountain also will be repaired.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Planned Parenthood in St. Louis could stop performing abortions as early as this week,"May 29, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/planned-parenthood-in-st-louis-could-stop-performing-abortions-as/article_35b27e68-2139-5aba-8306-3c0aa982291e.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — Planned Parenthood, which operates Missouri's only abortion clinic, said Tuesday it may be forced to cease abortions at the St. Louis facility this week amid a legal fight with the state.Planned Parenthood leaders said the facility's license was in jeopardy after the state sought to ""interrogate"" doctors as part of an annual license renewal process. They said the move was an ""intimidation"" tactic by the Department of Health and Senior Services.DHSS officials did not immediately respond to the accusations. 

However, Dr. Randall Williams, the state department's director, told the Post-Dispatch that the state would make a decision by Friday on whether to renew the facility's license. Before Planned Parenthood officials' comments Tuesday morning, Williams said he could not comment on the pending license renewal application.Since Planned Parenthood and the state have not come to an agreement on staff interviews, the Central West End clinic may have to end abortion services on Friday when its current license expires, Planned Parenthood officials said.""Missouri would be the first state in the country to go dark — without a health center that provides safe, legal abortion care,"" Dr. Leana Wen, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said in a statement.

            Planned Parenthood lawsuit

Jack Suntrup





In a lawsuit filed Tuesday in St. Louis Circuit Court, Planned Parenthood attorneys said the state was ""unlawfully conditioning"" renewal of the facility's license on the completion of an investigation into a patient complaint — the reason for the staff interviews, the lawsuit says.Reproductive Health Services of Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region runs the clinic.On Friday, Gov. Mike Parson signed one of the most restrictive abortion laws in the country.Most of the law's provisions — including one prohibiting most abortions eight weeks into a pregnancy — do not take effect until the end of August.In Metro East, Planned Parenthood operates an abortion clinic in Belleville. Another abortion provider, the Hope Clinic for Women, operates in Granite City.
Dr. Erin King, executive director of the Hope Clinic, said when the Missouri Legislature approved the new law that the clinic would work with patients from conservative states such as Missouri, which could lose access to abortion services.“We will continue to be one option for Missouri patients, as we always have. While the state of Missouri is waging a war against its abortion services and providers, the Hope Clinic remains committed to the patients of Missouri,” she said in a statement on Tuesday. “We will do everything in our power to make sure that further barriers associated with seeking abortion care out of state are lessened to the best of our ability.”Illinois, led by Democrats, has reported more out-of-state abortion patients in recent years as its Republican-led neighbors have further restricted abortions.Meanwhile, the ACLU of Missouri submitted a referendum to the Missouri secretary of state's office on Tuesday in an effort to repeal the abortion law that Parson, a Republican, signed last week.
The ACLU and its allies will have to collect more than 100,000 signatures and turn them into the secretary of state before Aug. 28, when the law is supposed to go into effect.If the group turns in enough signatures, the state will not be allowed to enact the law. At that point, a simple majority of voters could veto the law once it is placed on the ballot in 2020.David Humphreys, a GOP mega-donor who has voiced opposition to the new Missouri law, has said he would finance an effort to overturn the law.""He is not involved with our referendum effort, thus far, at least,"" said Sara Baker, legislative and policy director for the ACLU of Missouri. But, she said, ""we are very open to forming a broad right-left coalition on this.""The method is the same one unions used last year in their successful effort to overturn the state's short-lived right-to-work law.Images of abortion protests since 1973

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,What closing Missouri’s last abortion clinic will mean for neighboring states,"May 29, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/lifestyles/health-med-fit/what-closing-missouri-s-last-abortion-clinic-will-mean-for/article_d42c03fc-d032-560c-ba58-e46f58fe5b00.html,"ST. LOUIS — As the last abortion clinic in Missouri warned that it will have to stop providing the procedure as soon as Friday, abortion providers in surrounding states said they are anticipating an uptick of even more Missouri patients.At Hope Clinic in Granite City, Deputy Director Alison Dreith said Tuesday her clinic was preparing for more patients as news about Missouri spread.“We’re really scrambling today about the need for increased staff and how fast can we hire and train,” Dreith said.

And at a Trust Women clinic in Wichita, Kan., that already has to fly in doctors, the staff didn’t know what it would mean for their overloaded patient schedule.“God forbid we see that people can’t get services in Missouri,” said Julie Burkhart, Trust Women founder and CEO. “What is that going to mean on our limited physician days?”If St. Louis’ Planned Parenthood clinic is unable to offer abortions, the group said, Missouri would be the only state in the country to not have an operating abortion clinic. Five other states — Kentucky, Mississippi, North Dakota, South Dakota and West Virginia — reportedly have only one abortion clinic. And 90% of U.S. counties didn’t have an abortion clinic as of 2014, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive rights research and advocacy group.For some, this echoes back to the days before abortion was legalized nationwide in 1973 with the Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade decision, when patients who could afford to travel would go to more liberal states like California or New York where abortion was legal.But providers in Kansas and Illinois say this influx from Missouri isn’t new. About half of their clients already come from the Show Me State. To the south, in neighboring Arkansas, where a 72-hour waiting period will go into effect in July, the vast majority of its patients still live within the state.Over the past 10 years, four Missouri abortion clinics have closed because of increased regulations, including a mandatory 72-hour waiting period after receiving counseling on abortion, thus requiring two trips to a facility; requirements that physicians have hospital admitting privileges within 15 minutes of their clinics; and a rule requiring two-parent notification for minors and one-parent notarized consent. All those limits left one clinic in downtown St. Louis to serve the whole state.Now Planned Parenthood, which operates that final abortion clinic, said Tuesday it will be forced to end its abortion services altogether by Friday if the state suspends its license. The closure is not related to new anti-abortion laws that Missouri Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican, signed last week to ban most abortions after eight weeks of pregnancy. The new laws don’t take effect until August.
Already the number of patients in Missouri seeking an abortion at the clinic from April 2018 until this April had dropped by 50% compared with the same period the previous year. Planned Parenthood spokesman Jesse Lawder attributes two-thirds of the decrease to the clinic’s refusal to do pelvic exams for abortions performed through medication — recently required by the state — thus forcing all such abortions to be performed out of state.For Dreith, while she expects the Missouri numbers to continue to grow at her Illinois clinic across the Mississippi River, it’s not the only state sending patients her way.
“Patients were literally coming to us from the last remaining clinics in Kentucky … so that they wouldn’t get past 24 weeks,” Dreith said. “We don’t want these patients in surrounding states traveling [to] New York [or] California like they once had to.”That’s how it was prior to the Roe v. Wade ruling, according to Mary Ziegler, a professor at the Florida State University College of Law who is writing her third book on the history of the legal battle around abortion access. She anticipates the pattern of privilege will repeat itself.“You would still expect women with resources to be able to travel as far as they needed,” she said. “And you would expect women without resources to not be able to travel. … The more the court retreats from protecting abortion rights, the more stark those differences will become.”For Dreith, the historical comparison to the pre-Roe era rings true, albeit with improved medical practices.There are safer, easier and more effective ways to perform abortions now than the “horror stories that we saw pre-Roe,” said Dreith. “But I think the travel will be one of the huge throwbacks and the scariest part will be the criminalization.”States such as Missouri could feel pressure to start arresting women who perform their own abortions with pills at home or travel out of state, Ziegler said. But, she said, “punishing women isn’t something that’s thought to be very popular.”Kaiser Health News (KHN) is a national health policy news service.

Steve Roberts, a St. Louis Democrat, said Tuesday he will run for the 5th District seat currently held by Sen. Jamilah Nasheed in the 2020 election.Nasheed, also a Democrat, is term limited and cannot run again.

“The fifth district is the vibrant and exciting center of the region,” said Roberts, who is in his second term as a member of the House. “If elected, I would be honored to represent the district and its diverse population, and will work tirelessly to make sure all its people’s voices are heard.”Roberts is the latest current or former House member to say he’s eyeing a move to the Legislature’s upper chamber.Rep. Doug Beck, D-Affton, is running for the 1st Senate District post held by term-limited Sen. Scott Sifton. Republican Marsha Haefner, who now works for Gov. Mike Parson, also is listed as a potential candidate in that race.Democratic Reps. Tommie Pierson of St. Louis and Alan Green of Florissant are raising money to run in the 13th Senate District currently held by Minority Leader Gina Walsh of Bellefontaine Neighbors. Walsh is term limited.Democrat Mark Osmack has filed paperwork to run against state Sen. Andrew Koenig, R-Manchester in the 15th Senate District, which includes much of west St. Louis County.Osmack made an unsuccessful bid for Congress against Republican Ann Wagner in 2018.Rep. Deb Lavender, D-Kirkwood, told the Post-Dispatch Tuesday that she decided over the weekend to run for the seat, setting up a Democratic primary if both she and Osmack stay in the race.Rep. Chrissy Sommer, R-St. Charles, has filed to run in the St. Charles County district currently held by fellow Republican Sen. Bill Eigel of Weldon Spring.
Prior to winning a seat in the House, Roberts was a prosecutor in the St. Louis circuit attorney’s office.In the House, Roberts has been an advocate for criminal justice reform and economic development.“Social justice and economic development will continue to be a central focus in my campaign and, if I am elected, in my work as a state senator,” Roberts said. “During my time as a prosecutor, I saw firsthand how the system can ensnare those who come into contact with it, especially low-income offenders and people of color.”
The district, a stronghold for Democrats, includes downtown St. Louis and hugs the Mississippi River, stretching from Gimblin Road in the north to the River Des Peres in the south.Roberts' announcement comes a week after he and a fellow lawmaker dropped their lawsuits stemming from an alleged sexual assault.The actions leading to the suits began in September 2016 when Rep. Cora Faith Walker accused Roberts of sexually assaulting her in his apartment in St. Louis.Roberts contended they had consensual sex and sued, accusing Walker of defamation, malicious prosecution and infliction of emotional distress.Walker filed her own civil suit in January 2017. It denied Roberts’ defamation allegation and also accused Roberts of drugging and sexually assaulting her, and claimed that his civil suit was filed to inflict emotional distress.Roberts also is being sued by a woman who alleges he sexually assaulted her at a St. Louis bar in 2015, when she was a law student.Jack Suntrup of the Post-Dispatch contributed to this report.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Trump administration questions why a single judge can block its policies nationwide,"May 26, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/national/trump-administration-questions-why-a-single-judge-can-block-its/article_e0ed8b0b-73ea-5292-b0da-9c3afc871c10.html,"Here are the stories our panel of top political reporters will be watching for in the week ahead, in this week's ""Inside Politics"" forecast.1. Border wall loses another round in courtA federal judge in California is blocking President Donald Trump's plan to use Pentagon funds to build his border wall. New York Times reporter Michael Shear says it's the 38th time a federal court has blocked one of Trump's policies.

Shear said what's particularly galling to the President is that a single district court judge has the power to block his plans everywhere, through a nationwide injunction.""Attorney General Bill Barr complained about it last week, saying that this practice is a violation of Constitutional principles,"" Shear said. ""So the Trump Administration will be going to the Supreme Court to ask the justices to stop this practice. Legal scholars say that's highly unlikely, but there's more than a little bit of irony here -- during eight years of Barack Obama's administration, a favorite tool of Republicans was, you guessed it, going to federal judges asking them to block policies they didn't like.""2. Democrats gear up for election-year fight over abortionMissouri Republican Gov. Mike Parson signed one of the nation's most restrictive abortion laws last week, barring the procedure beyond the eighth week of pregnancy, without exceptions for rape or incest.Missouri joins a growing list of red states seeking to all but ban the vast majority of abortions. Time's Molly Ball says Democrats want to make the future of Roe v. Wade a signature 2020 issue.""Thousands of women and others all over the country came out to protest these laws, and you have all of the 2020 Democratic candidates coming out against them,"" Ball said. ""Even some Republicans say some of these laws go too far. So this is an issue that's going to continue to simmer. You can expect it to still be going on when we get to next year, and you'll hear the candidates talking about this a lot.""3. Saudi weapons sales fightPresident Trump said on Friday he's bypassing Congress to sell more than $8 billion worth of arms to Saudi Arabia -- an announcement that drew condemnation from lawmakers in both parties who want to punish the Saudis for the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi and other human rights abuses.""This is something Congress had been blocking for months, and now they have gone around Congress to complete the sales,"" CNN's Phil Mattingly said, and that's something lawmakers never like.""Saudi Arabia's support on Capitol Hill has really wilted over the course of the last 10 or 11 months, and that is bipartisan,"" Mattingly said. ""You're going to see lawmakers consider a number of ways to try and stop this from happening in the future.""4. Congress & IranAnd that's not the only foreign policy flashpoint on Capitol Hill. Lawmakers are also concerned about the President's plan for Iran -- last week he approved sending an additional 1,500 troops to the region.
""You've seen steps be taken in the last week where the administration finally came down to Capitol Hill to explain the escalation and the movement of a combat strike group and everything else that's been going on in the Persian Gulf,"" Washington Post reporter Karoun Demirjian said.One question, Demirjian said, is whether some lawmakers will push for a new Authorization for the Use of Military Force -- known as an AUMF -- rather than relying on the one passed soon after 9/11 that's been used as the legal justification for military action in the region ever since.5. Recession worries in 2020And from CNN Chief National Correspondent John King:This weekend's presidential trip to Japan is more style than substance. The next one will be far more important -- for the global economy and for Trump's reelection hopes.
The Dow was down last week, and it was the fifth losing week in a row. That hasn't happened since 2011.Trade tensions are the biggest factor, and specifically trade tensions with China.It is easy to find analysts who say the market selloff would be even worse were it not for the anticipation that Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping will strike a deal -- or at least the outlines of an agreement -- when they meet next month at the annual G-20 summit in Osaka.But there are also a growing number of market watchers, or US-China relations experts, who look back at the last week and see steps by both countries that suggest longer-term nationalist instincts are trumping shorter-term economic concerns.Here in the states, the Trump administration's new restrictions on Chinese tech giant Huawei complicate any effort to resolve major trade differences.And those watching President Xi this past week as he traveled and focused on economic issues at home also see a leader digging in for a longer-term showdown.""Huawei is very iconic to the Chinese, kind of like Apple to us, so putting them on the entity list is a real slap in the face and threatens to take the trade war from economics to war over nationalistic pride,"" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. ""It makes it very difficult to stand down.""Trump says standing up to China's unfair trade and other economic policies is long overdue, and he continually voices the belief that the American economy is strong enough to absorb the pain of a trade war.But he also wants that humming economy as his re-election calling card, and a prolonged trade war could put that at risk.Zandi pegs the odds of 2020 recession at 30 percent if nothing changes in the current economic climate. And Zandi says, in his view, the odds of a pre-election recession jump to 50 percent or more if the US-China feud escalates and additional tariffs are added."
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"'Our bodies, our rights:' Hundreds protest Missouri bill banning abortion at 8 weeks","May 25, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/our-bodies-our-rights-hundreds-protest-missouri-bill-banning-abortion/article_5f58c107-53c6-5894-a5cd-d675141b61ab.html,"ST. LOUIS — Hundreds of people gathered Saturday in downtown St. Louis for a student-led protest against a sweeping piece of anti-abortion legislation they say puts lives at risk and is a step back for individual rights.“Our bodies, our rights,” Shri Anantha, 16, with STL Pro-Choice Student Activists, said to a crowd at Poelker Park that included students of all ages, healthcare workers, Missouri Democrats and candidates for state offices.The legislation signed Friday by Gov. Mike Parson bans most abortions at eight weeks of pregnancy, except in medical emergencies. There are no exceptions for rape, incest or human trafficking. The ban takes effect in late August.

“By signing this bill today, we are sending a strong signal to the nation that, in Missouri, we stand for life, protect women’s health, and advocate for the unborn,” Parson said in a statement Friday. “All life has value and is worth protecting.”Some attorneys have said the bill could subject women to felony charges if they perform their own abortions.Protesters Saturday said the ban puts people’s lives at risk by cutting off access to vital healthcare and would disproportionately affect African-Americans and people in poverty.“With this extreme ban on safe and legal abortion, our government is reducing us to our ability to get pregnant, erasing our moral agency, and disregarding our humanity,” said Sarah Felts, spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood. Planned Parenthood runs the only abortion clinic in the state, in the Central West End neighborhood of St. Louis.The bill will not stop abortions from being performed, it will force people to use less-safe methods, said Pamela Merritt, co-founder of the abortion-rights group Reproaction. She called on protesters to support abortion-rights groups and healthcare facilities.“Abortion will exist despite this ban,” she said.The protesters vowed to fight the bill in court and at the ballot box. The League of Women Voters attended the protest to register voters, particularly students who will be of voting age by 2020.“A vote in 2020 is a vote for a woman’s right to life, said state Sen. Jamilah Nasheed, D-St. Louis. “And a woman’s right to life is a woman’s right to choose.”
Trish Gunby, a Democratic candidate to fill a vacancy in Missouri’s 99th District in St. Louis County, said the bill represented a regression that conflicted with the rights established under the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade.“I did not think that 40 years ago, as a teenager, I would have more rights than I do today,” she said.If the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade, “in whole or in part,” the new Missouri legislation states that all abortions would be made illegal except in cases of a medical emergency.
The legislation requires both parents or guardians to be notified before minors can get an abortion, in most cases.Lauryn Donovan, 16, a student at Ladue Horton Watkins High School, said the bill was a form of “institutionalized oppression.”“Don’t force feed your views down somebody’s throat,” Donovan said.The abortion ban doesn’t just affect women, said Louie Westland, 17, a student at Rockwood Summit High School.“This is not a gendered issue,” Westland said. “This is an everybody issue.”Cort VanOstran, a lawyer who narrowly lost the race for Missouri’s 2nd congressional district in November to U.S. Rep. Ann Wagner, R-Mo., said he had a message for men in the crowd.“If we want to live in a country where personal freedoms mean something, we should stand up against laws that take away the rights of half the population,” he said.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Editorial: Will Humphreys lead the charge to take the GOP back from its extremists?,"May 25, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-will-humphreys-lead-the-charge-to-take-the-gop/article_4dd077b3-f15d-5c11-9939-00474b08df21.html,"Conservative mega-donor David Humphreys emerged as an unlikely hero last week in his appeal for Gov. Mike Parson to veto the bill passed by the Legislature on May 17 imposing draconian restrictions on abortion. Parson signed it anyway Friday, setting the scene for a potential battle in the months ahead for the soul of Missouri’s Republican Party.Humphreys made an open appeal for Republicans to err on the side of reason, moderation and compassion, especially for the victims of rape and incest who would be penalized by these new abortion restrictions. Parson, by signing House Bill 126 behind closed doors on Friday, has joined forces with the party’s social-conservative extremists.Humphreys feels so strongly about HB 126’s overreach, he might fund a ballot initiative in 2020 to reverse it, a source close to him told the Post-Dispatch’s Kurt Erickson. “I am personally opposed to HB 126 and believe it was poorly thought out and passed without appropriate public debate,” Humphreys said in a statement. “A bill this restrictive, without the opportunity for exceptions for rape and incest, is bad public policy and bad for Missourians.”

Parson’s decision to sign the bill anyway deepens the party’s ideological split just as campaigns gear up for the 2020 election, in which the governor would be seeking his first full term after succeeding disgraced Gov. Eric Greitens in the job a year ago. He is not a political heavy hitter, and ostracizing someone like Humphreys could prove to be a serious strategic error.
Humphreys rarely takes overt public stands on major social issues, and for him to do so now indicates how strongly he feels about legislative overreach.“I have never entered the public debate over abortion. Nor have I wanted to. Nor do I really want to now,” Humphreys stated. “It is a very difficult subject. And a very personal one with complicated moral issues for all involved. While I am personally opposed to abortion, I do support women’s right to choose particularly in the case of rape or incest. And I have to believe that the politicians in Jeff City that voted for this bill would themselves support their wives or daughters’ right to choose if their loved ones were raped.”
Our issue with Humphreys in the past has been that his generous donations to Republican candidates and causes unduly influences election results, skews democracy and dilutes the power of Missourians’ votes. Politicians, fearful of losing his support, too often blindly support his causes rather than voting their consciences.That he’s conflicted reflects that Humphreys recognizes the nuances of this complicated subject — as should we all — and has determined that extremist solutions are not the answer. Humphreys offers hope that reasonable, moderate Republicans will step forward to take back their party."
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri Gov. Mike Parson signs bill banning abortions at 8 weeks,"May 25, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/missouri-gov-mike-parson-signs-bill-banning-abortions-at-weeks/article_d0cdea5f-89b6-58bd-9221-53e5ee0cb5be.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — Gov. Mike Parson on Friday signed a sweeping piece of anti-abortion legislation that critics and others argue will subject women to felony charges if they perform their own abortions.Parson’s signature comes less than 24 hours after GOP mega donor David Humphreys urged the governor to veto the measure, which bans most abortions at eight weeks of pregnancy. Critics say the legislation — which includes no rape or incest exemptions — is too extreme.The eight-week ban will take effect in late August.

“By signing this bill today, we are sending a strong signal to the nation that, in Missouri, we stand for life, protect women’s health, and advocate for the unborn,” Parson said in a statement. “All life has value and is worth protecting.”Democrats and abortion-rights groups blasted the decision.“Missouri law now requires people to remain pregnant against their will, treating them as little more than fetal incubators with no rights or role in the decision, even in cases of rape and incest,” House Minority Leader Crystal Quade, D-Springfield, said in a statement.“We cannot long claim to be a free society when the heavy hand of government is used to crush individual liberty and subject us to the mandates of official state doctrine,” she said.Instead of holding a public ceremony, Parson signed the legislation in private Friday morning, an unusual move for a governor who has emphasized transparency during his tenure. He did not notify the public that he intended to sign the bill this week.Parson’s secretive predecessor, former Gov. Eric Greitens, also held a private ceremony in 2017 where he signed legislation further regulating abortion in the state.Parson’s spokesman Steele Shippy said Parson had intended to hold public signing events this week in Springfield and Cape Girardeau, but changed his mind after tornadoes and flooding tore up areas of the state.Parson’s signature comes as much of the state’s attention has turned toward natural disaster recovery.Before a tornado swept through Jefferson City Wednesday night, abortion-rights activists had mobilized in an effort to convince Parson, a Republican, to veto the measure.The 2019 legislation bans abortions in the state of Missouri at eight weeks of pregnancy, except in medical emergencies. There are no exceptions for rape, incest or human trafficking.If the Supreme Court overturns Roe vs. Wade, “in whole or in part,” the legislation states that all abortions would be made illegal except in cases of a medical emergency.The legislation also bans a woman from aborting a fetus that might have Down syndrome. It also requires both parents or guardians to be notified before minors can get an abortion, in most cases.
A Jefferson City attorney who analyzed the bill for the Post-Dispatch said it is possible that a woman could be charged with a Class B felony for performing or inducing her own abortion. A Class B felony carries a sentence of between five and 15 years in prison.“My opinion is that there are circumstances in which it is at least possible that a woman could be charged with a felony,” said Lowell Pearson, a Husch Blackwell managing partner who has represented a number of Republican clients, including U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri.The bill says: “Any person who knowingly performs or induces an abortion of an unborn child in violation of this subsection shall be guilty of a class B felony, as well as subject to suspension or revocation of his or her professional license by his or her professional licensing board.”Shippy, Parson’s spokesman, said women inducing or performing their own abortions under the law would not be charged, but he did not elaborate on how the governor’s legal team reached that conclusion.“We are confident in our legal analysis,” Shippy said.
A spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood Advocates in Missouri said the organization’s attorneys were analyzing the legislation and could challenge the new law in court.“We are examining all of our options to ensure Missourians have access to the healthcare that they need,” said Sarah Felts, of Planned Parenthood.Planned Parenthood runs the only abortion clinic in the state, in the Central West End neighborhood of St. Louis.Humphreys said Thursday he would fund an effort to overturn the legislation at the ballot in 2020 if Parson signed it.It is unclear whether putting a question on the ballot would have any significant impact on turnout or on Parson’s ability to win a full term.University of Missouri-St. Louis political scientist Dave Robertson said the same women who are mobilized to oust President Donald Trump also would be mobilized to head to the polls to try to overturn the new abortion law.“It’s a marginal impact,” Robertson said.The legislation is House Bill 126.Kurt Erickson of the Post-Dispatch contributed to this report.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Editorial: Short takes on 'consensual rape' and submarine subterfuge,"May 24, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-short-takes-on-consensual-rape-and-submarine-subterfuge/article_6dfdfed8-f6a0-5966-bc42-1088160ce320.html,"Consensual ignoranceIs there maybe something in the Missouri water? This state is quickly acquiring a national reputation for its bumper crop of men who think they can speak authoritatively about women’s sexuality and reproductive systems but who clearly don’t have a clue.First there was Rep. Todd Akin, who as a Republican U.S. Senate candidate disastrously coined the phrase “legitimate rape” when trying to weirdly explain that women’s bodies have a way of naturally rejecting pregnancy when they’ve been raped. As he explained, the body knows when the rape is legitimate. If pregnancy occurs, his thinking went, then it must not have been rape. The comment handed an easy victory to his Democratic opponent, Sen. Claire McCaskill.

Now comes state Rep. Barry Hovis, another Republican, who used the phrase “consensual rape” as a way of explaining why rape and incest should not be included as exceptions to a bill banning all abortions after eight weeks of pregnancy. That law was passed by the Legislature on May 17 and signed by Gov. Mike Parson on Friday.Hovis, of Jackson, told House members during debate on the closing day of the legislative session that it’s rare for real rape to occur under surprise circumstances involving strangers “jumping out of the bushes.” Such attacks occur maybe “one, two times out of 100,” he said. “Most of them were date rapes or consensual rapes, which were all terrible.”He later apologized, acknowledging that “there is no such thing” as consensual rape. But there is such a thing as consensual ignorance, and Hovis proudly waves its banner.Paying it forwardA billionaire philanthropist has pledged to eliminate the student loan debt of the entire 2019 graduating class of Morehouse College in Atlanta. It’s an astounding show of generosity and an example of social conscience that should occur more commonly among the richest Americans. If it puts a bright spotlight on the nation’s student-loan crisis as well, all the better.Billionaire investor and philanthropist Robert F. Smith announced his plan in a bombshell surprise during his commencement speech at the all-male, historically black college last Sunday. Smith, who is black, is chairman and CEO of Vista Equity Partners, a software and technology investment firm. Wiping out the student debt of the 396 new grads is estimated to cost about $10 million.Smith’s unscripted announcement stunned even the school’s administrators, who’d known nothing about it. Smith encouraged the students to “pay it forward” by helping “ensure we have all the opportunities of the American dream.”New housing for Wellston crook?A federal court should throw the book at Marchell Benton, the former head of the Wellston Housing Authority, for having stolen up to $40,000 of tenants’ rent money and deposited it in her personal bank account. She took the money between 2013 and 2015, when the authority, immersed in mismanagement, incompetence and malfeasance, had been driven into federal receivership.Fast forward to today. Hundreds of low-income Wellston parents and children now face upheaval as their long-neglected housing is threatened with demolition because inadequate funds are available to make the necessary repairs to keep their homes habitable. They could soon have to move — as Benton probably will.
The only difference is that Benton’s new housing should have cold concrete floors and steel doors that slam shut and only open when her prison guards authorize it. Benton has pleaded guilty. Her sentencing is scheduled for August.Semper Fortis?Male sailors aboard a Navy submarine kept a “rape list” and a sexual ranking system regarding female crew members, and invited comments on what types of sex acts the sailors wanted them to perform, according to a recently revealed internal investigation.The 74-page investigation, obtained by Military.comvia a freedom-of-information request, found that female crew members aboard the U.S.S. Florida — only the second Navy submarine to integrate women — were the subject of a list that male crew members kept on the submarine’s computer network. Another list sexually ranked female crew members using a star system.
As disturbing as the harassment itself was, the report’s conclusion is equally troubling: The sub’s commander (who was ultimately relieved of duty) and others in authority failed to adequately address it.In a 2014 scandal, female officers and midshipmen aboard a different submarine were secretly recorded while showering. The military has come a long way on gender issues, but clearly still has a long way to go.Majority rulesNevada in January became the first state in the nation to seat a majority-female legislature. Since then, bills focusing on women’s health and safety have topped the agenda, while sexual harassment within the legislature has been addressed head-on.In part in response to President Donald Trump’s election, Nevada voters in November elected 23 women of both parties to the Assembly and 10 to the Senate, giving women a combined total of 52 percent of seats.That gender power shift has dramatically impacted the focus of legislation. Almost 20 bills have been filed dealing with sexual assault, sex trafficking and sexual misconduct, with others addressing subjects like banning child marriage and examining the causes of maternal mortality.“There’s change in this building that is just this amazing story of transformation,” Nevada Assemblywoman Heidi Swank told The Washington Post. “And it really highlights the importance of the female majority being not just here, but finally being heard.”Compare that to, say, Alabama — where a dismal 15 percent of the Legislature is female, and which just passed what is arguably the most draconian abortion ban in America. That said, the state’s female governor signed it into law."
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,More than 70 buildings destroyed by tornado in Missouri capital,"May 24, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/more-than-buildings-destroyed-by-tornado-in-missouri-capital/article_d3e1843d-efb2-5c09-84aa-6dcc6263ac97.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — A preliminary review of tornado damage in Missouri’s capital city shows 78 buildings were destroyed in Wednesday’s overnight storm.According to information collected by a team of emergency personnel workers Thursday, the buildings include parts of a large apartment complex on the city’s south side, as well as structures near downtown that were more than a century old.Stacey Young, who operates an appraisal business out of a historic brick building on Capitol Avenue, was hurrying Friday to move records and other articles out of the two-story structure before the hot, sunny weather turned stormy again.

She said the level of destruction east of the unscathed Capitol building was heartbreaking to the property owners who are trying to transform the area.“We’ve all been working very, very diligently trying to get these buildings back in shape,” Young said. “We are all extremely grateful there were no lives lost, but we are wondering what’s going to happen to a lot of these structures.”Young said she had just spent $60,000 to upgrade an apartment on the second story of the building that now features a collapsed exterior wall.“I hope to get a structural engineer in there to find out whether the building can be saved,” Young said.Residents and workers worked Friday to dig out from the tornado that injured an estimated 25 people as it cut a swath across the mid-Missouri town of 40,000 residents. No fatalities were reported in Jefferson City, but three died near Golden City in Barton County.
var pymParent = pym.Parent('pym-content-2', '//graphics.stltoday.com/apps/maps/tornadoes/2019-05-22/jefferson-city/', {});The storm that hit Jefferson City was rated as an EF-3 with estimated peak winds of 160 miles per hour, the National Weather Service said.Along with the structures that were listed as destroyed, an additional 15 were listed as “failed” because of concerns that they could suddenly collapse.
The map shows hundreds of other homes, businesses and government buildings with moderate damage across the mid-section of the community.Gov. Mike Parson said the assessment was done by a team of volunteer engineers, architects, building inspectors, and other trained professionals as part of the Missouri Structural Assessment and Visual Evaluation program.On Saturday, the team is expected to evaluate about 200 additional structures in Cole County that are reported to have been damaged.
The American Red Cross was operating two shelters Friday — one at a Jefferson City middle school and another in Eldon, south of Jefferson City.On Thursday night, the shelter population totaled 33 people.In a press release, the Red Cross urged people to donate cash rather than household items such as clothes, food or furniture.“The shelters in Jefferson City and Eldon have received numerous donations such as clothing and toiletries and are requesting the public to hold off on any additional items at this time. The Red Cross is working with community partners to determine a specific location that is able to take additional items for individuals affected by the tornado and the information will be provided as it becomes available,” the organization said.As of Friday morning, Ameren Missouri and Three Rivers Electric Cooperative reported nearly 4,000 outages, down from 14,000 on Thursday.Although frontline workers like prison guards and law enforcement workers were still on duty, the majority of the more than 14,000 state government workers who descend on the office buildings in the city were off on Friday. In addition to ongoing cleanup and recovery efforts, employee parking lots near some state office buildings were underwater as the Missouri River topped its flood stage.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Conservative donor drops abortion bombshell, urging Parson to veto Missouri limits","May 24, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/conservative-donor-drops-abortion-bombshell-urging-parson-to-veto-missouri/article_f78ad070-3bc8-5287-9ee3-f449af754cfc.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — A wealthy conservative donor to Republican causes is urging Gov. Mike Parson to veto a restrictive abortion law approved by Missouri lawmakers last week.In a statement obtained by the Post-Dispatch, Joplin-based roofing magnate David Humphreys said a lack of exceptions in House Bill 126 allowing for abortion in cases of rape and incest of the mother “is bad public policy and bad for Missourians.”“I am personally opposed to HB 126 and believe it was poorly thought out and passed without appropriate public debate,” Humphreys wrote. “I have never entered the public debate over abortion. Nor have I wanted to. Nor do I really want to now.”

The email puts Parson, a Republican, in a tight political spot as he considers whether to sign the measure, which was designed to trigger a court challenge that could overturn the U.S. Supreme Court’s landmark Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized abortion.If Parson signs the legislation, a source close to Humphreys said the mega-donor would bankroll a ballot initiative in 2020 seeking to undo the changes. A spirited debate over abortion could play a pivotal role in Parson’s bid for a full term as chief executive.Parson’s office, which was monitoring and assessing tornado damage in the capital city on Thursday, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Humphreys, whose Tamko Building Products makes roofing shingles, has funneled millions of dollars toward GOP causes in recent years, including to the election of U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley and to the House Republican fundraising arm.During the 2016 election cycle, Humphreys and his family contributed more than $14 million to Republicans.Legislation sponsored the following year by former state Senate President Pro Tem Ron Richard, also of Joplin, would have limited a plaintiff’s ability to sue individually or in class-action lawsuits under the Missouri Merchandising Practices Act, a law that prohibits deceptive and unfair business practices.The proposed change came as Tamko was facing a class-action lawsuit under the act alleging it sold defective shingles. The company has denied the charges.Parson told reporters last week that he planned to sign the measure, which bans abortions at eight weeks of pregnancy, except when the life of the mother is threatened. There are no exceptions for rape, incest or human trafficking.The legislation also bans a woman from aborting a fetus that might have Down syndrome. It requires both parents or guardians to be notified before minors can get an abortion, in most cases.
The measure says anyone “who knowingly performs or induces an abortion” in cases that are not exempted by the legislation would be guilty of a Class B felony, which carries a minimum five-year prison sentence.If the Supreme Court overturns Roe vs. Wade, “in whole or in part,” the legislation states that all abortions would be made illegal except in cases of a medical emergency.Humphreys called abortion “a very difficult subject. And a very personal one with complicated moral issues for all involved.”“While I am personally opposed to abortion, I do support a women’s right to choose, particularly in the case of rape or incest. And I have to believe that the politicians in Jeff City that voted for this bill would themselves support their wives or daughters’ right to choose if their loved ones were raped,” he said.
“I hope that Governor Parson will consider the bill’s harmful impact on women and veto this legislation,” Humphreys added.Missouri already has some of the toughest abortion regulations in the country. There is one clinic in the state, in the Central West End neighborhood of St. Louis, but clinics also operate in Metro East — in Granite City and Fairview Heights. Planned Parenthood operates a clinic in Kansas, near Kansas City, Mo.In 2017, lawmakers approved, and then-Gov. Eric Greitens signed into law, a round of abortion regulations that proponents said would protect the health and safety of women.It requires that doctors explain the risks of abortion to women 72 hours before an abortion is performed. The law added annual inspections of clinics and new whistleblower protections for employees of clinics, and boosted requirements for pathologists who provide services to abortion facilities.Another Republican mega-donor, retired St. Louis financier Rex Sinquefield, is apparently not entering the debate over the abortion bill.A spokesman for Sinquefield said Thursday he had “no position” on the legislation.Jack Suntrup of the Post-Dispatch contributed to this report.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Tornado kills 3 in southwestern Missouri on anniversary of deadly Joplin twister,"May 24, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/state-and-regional/tornado-kills-in-southwestern-missouri-on-anniversary-of-deadly-joplin/article_b65db840-b6d7-539e-a28c-4b43a4ef49d9.html,"JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. — Theresa Stephens hunkered down in her pitch black apartment, listening to the violent tornado that was coming.""I didn't realize it was that close,"" she said. ""You could hear it coming. It was like, 'whoosh.""On Thursday, wrapped in a blanket at a shelter the morning after an EF-3 tornado blew overthrough Jefferson City, Stephens said she thought her apartment was undamaged, but said some of her neighbors weren't as lucky. When the storm passed, officials told Stephens and her neighbors to evacuate, and she left her five parakeets behind at the Hawthorne Park Apartments. 

""I hope they're OK,"" said Stephens, 59, sitting alone at a cafeteria table in Thomas Jefferson Middle School — one of countless people whose lives were interrupted by the twister Wednesday night. The tornado caused heavy damage in Missouri's capital city as severe weather swept across the state overnight, causing three deaths in southwest Missouri and leaving many people trapped in the wreckage of their homes.The National Weather Service confirmed the twister that moved over Jefferson City shortly before midnight Wednesday, moving northeast at 40 mph. The capital city has a population of about 40,000 and is located about 130 miles west of St. Louis.""Across the state, Missouri's first responders once again responded quickly and with strong coordination as much of the state dealt with extremely dangerous conditions that left people injured, trapped in homes, and tragically led to the death of three people,"" Gov. Mike Parson said Thursday morning, as the extent of damage was becoming clear.The three dead were on the outskirts of a town called Golden City, in Barton County, Mo., about 50 miles west of Springfield. Sgt. John Lueckenhoff of the Missouri Highway Patrol identified the victims as Kenneth Harris, 86; his wife, Opal Harris, 83; and Betty Berg, 56.Kenneth and Opal Harris lived in a frame home on 80th Lane near Golden City. ""They were found about 200 yards from where their residence once stood,"" Lueckenhoff told the Post-Dispatch.
var pymParent = pym.Parent('pym-content-1', '//graphics.stltoday.com/apps/maps/tornadoes/2019-05-22/golden-city/', {});Berg lived nearby, in a mobile home on Highway 126. Her husband, Mark Berg, 56, survived. The Bergs were found among debris from the mobile home, Lueckenhoff said.National Weather Service meteorologist Cory Rothstein said it's possible the tornado had a 50-mile path and could have been on the ground for 80 minutes. Teams were surveying the path Thursday and trying to determine whether one or multiple tornadoes had touched down.The National Weather Service office in Springfield issued its tornado warning there at 8:34 p.m., and based on radar, put the arrival time of the tornado around 9:08 p.m. Several other people were injured in the Carl Junction area of Jasper County. A 'chaotic' situationThe Jefferson City tornado cut a path about 3 miles long and a mile wide from the south end of Jefferson City north toward the Missouri River around 11:40 p.m. Wednesday, said police Lt. David Williams.
var pymParent = pym.Parent('pym-content-2', '//graphics.stltoday.com/apps/maps/tornadoes/2019-05-22/jefferson-city/', {});Emergency workers reported about two dozen injuries, Williams said, and dozens of people were in shelters. Hospitals reported treating injuries such as cuts and bruises. There were no immediate reports of any deaths or missing people in the capital city.Williams said authorities received multiple calls of people being trapped in homes and described the situation overnight as ""chaotic."" The National Weather Service sent survey teams to Golden City and Jefferson City areas to inspect the damage.Doug Tilly, meteorologist with the National Weather Service office in Weldon Spring, said the Jefferson City tornado appears to have covered at least 30 miles — from Eldon, Mo., on the south to north of Jefferson City.""As far as we can tell, it was on the ground the entire time,"" Tilly said.Thousands of power outages were reported, according to an outage map from Ameren.'It's a sad day'The tornado ripped a swath through the eastern edge of downtown Jefferson City, avoiding much of the main shopping district. But, on Marshall Street, Kent George bemoaned the damage to his 29-unit apartment building.
""I just put a new roof on it,"" George said.He was relieved none of his tenants were hurt.At the corner of Marshall and Capitol, where historic homes were being primed for redevelopment, trees and roofing material littered the streets. Utility crews cordoned off intersections where electric wires lay after poles snapped in the wind.The tornado did not damage the Missouri Capitol Building or the Governor's Mansion, but it did significant damage to the state Employment Security Building, located in the line of the storm. The facility's roof and air conditioning units will need to be replaced. Power at the building could be out for several days, said the governor's Office of Administration.The Missouri Career Center also received extensive damage. Other buildings that sustained minor roof damage include the Lewis and Clark State Office Building, the state public health lab and the Missouri Lottery headquarters.
While state Rep. Rudy Veit, an attorney from Jefferson City, surveyed the damage to his law offices on High Street, he also was thankful no one was injured when the glass-sheathed structure was hit.""We've already had offers of places to move while we rebuild,"" Veit said. ""Hopefully we can get the electricity back on and get back on track.""After 40 years in the communications business, Steve Veile was poised to head into retirement this year. Now he's not sure what his next step will be.
Veile’s building, like others, was built long ago by inmates at the shuttered Missouri State Penitentiary just down the street. He moved in and restored what had once been a family home with horse stables in the basement.It’s been home to his Communique Communications for 36 years. The company does strategic communications for businesses and organizations.“It’s a sad day,” Veile said.Gary and Lynette Jackson, of the 400 block of Marshall Street near downtown, were assessing the damage around noon to their one-story home. The wall to their sun room had blown off, and several windows on their cars and home were busted.""I'm still really nervous,"" said Lynette Jackson, 52, who works for the state.She worried about the structural integrity of the home where the couple had lived for 15 years, and whether damaged trees would fall and cause more damage.Birthday cake supplies and an old state manual were scattered around the home.""Everything inside is just turned around,"" Lynette Jackson said. ""The windows are busted out.""Anniversary of deadly Joplin tornado














        
            It seems like Tornado Alley is shifting - and Missouri and Illinois are seeing more

In the traditional alley states of Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas, tornado activity has dropped a little - but it's gotten higher here. And scient…




The string of storms included a tornado near Carl Junction that skirted just a few miles north of Joplin, Mo., on the eighth anniversary of a catastrophic tornado that killed 161 people in the city.Storms and torrential rains have ravaged the Midwest, from Texas through Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, Iowa, Missouri and Illinois.The Arkansas River was approaching historic highs, while the already high Missouri and Mississippi Rivers were again rising after a multiday stretch of storms that produced dozens of tornadoes. Forecasters predicted parts of Oklahoma, Missouri and Kansas could see more severe weather on Thursday.Deaths from this week's storms include a 74-year-old woman found early Wednesday morning in Iowa. Missouri authorities said heavy rain was a contributing factor in the deaths of two people in a traffic accident Tuesday near Springfield.Another weather-related death may have occurred in Oklahoma, where the Highway Patrol said a woman apparently drowned after driving around a barricade Tuesday near Perkins, about 45 miles northeast of Oklahoma City.The Associated Press and Kim Bell of the Post-Dispatch staff contributed to this report.

""I want our responders and all the neighbors who acted selflessly to help their neighbors to know how much their heroic efforts are appreciated by all Missourians.""

        Missouri Public Safety tweeted that there was a possibility of more tornadoes and flash flooding.Austin Thomson, 25, was in the laundry room of his apartment complex to do his wash and noticed the wind started picking up. He saw sheets of rain coming down and a flagpole bend and then slam to the ground. The windows broke and he dove behind the washers and dryers.
After it calmed down, he walked outside to check the damage.""There's basically one building that's basically one story now. Every building there is two stories.""The National Weather Service said it had received 22 reports of tornadoes by late Wednesday, although some of those could be duplicate reporting of the same twister.One tornado skirted just a few miles north of Joplin, Missouri, on the eighth anniversary of a catastrophic tornado that killed 161 people in the city. The tornado caused some damage in the town of Carl Junction, about 4 miles (6.44 kilometers) north of the Joplin airport.Storms and torrential rains have ravaged the Midwest, from Texas through Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, Iowa, Missouri and Illinois.
Two barges broke loose and floated swiftly down the swollen Arkansas River in eastern Oklahoma on Wednesday, spreading alarm downstream as they threatened to hit a dam.Authorities urged residents of several small towns in Oklahoma and Kansas to leave their homes as rivers and streams rose.The Arkansas River town of Webbers Falls, Oklahoma, was one such town. Town officials ordered a mandatory evacuation Wednesday afternoon because of the river's rising level.But Wednesday evening, a posting on the town's official Facebook page sounded the alarm about the runaway barges for its 600 residents: ""Evacuate Webbers Falls immediately. The barges are loose and has the potential to hit the lock and dam 16. If the dam breaks, it will be catastrophic!! Leave now!!""There was no word by midnight Wednesday where the barges were on the river, but local television stations showing live video of the river and the lock and dam said they had not yet arrived.The Arkansas River was approaching historic highs, while the already high Missouri and Mississippi Rivers were again rising after a multi-day stretch of storms that produced dozens of tornadoes. Forecasters predicted parts of Oklahoma, Missouri and Kansas could see more severe weather on Thursday.Deaths from this week's storms include a 74-year-old woman found early Wednesday morning in Iowa. Officials there say she was killed by a possible tornado that damaged a farmstead in Adair County. Missouri authorities said heavy rain was a contributing factor in the deaths of two people in a traffic accident Tuesday near Springfield.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Will Missouri women face felonies for performing abortions on themselves? Lawyers disagree.,"May 23, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/will-missouri-women-face-felonies-for-performing-abortions-on-themselves/article_0dd4868f-2a96-5445-a1ed-f6dfe19b4b5f.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — Democrats opposed to a Missouri proposal outlawing most abortions say women who perform one on themselves could soon be subject to felony charges. Republican sponsors say this would never happen.But detractors of the bill — which bans abortions at eight weeks of pregnancy — have laid out several scenarios in which they believe prosecutors may be able to charge a woman who undergoes an abortion.A scorned lover could accuse a woman who had a miscarriage of actually having an abortion, in violation of the law, they say. The woman could take a drug to induce an abortion, in violation of the law, they say.

Proponents say the hypothetical scenarios are scare tactics meant to sow doubt in one of the nation’s toughest anti-abortion proposals, which awaits Gov. Mike Parson’s signature.A Jefferson City attorney who analyzed the bill for the Post-Dispatch said it is possible that a woman could be charged with a Class B felony for performing or inducing her own abortion. A Class B felony carries a sentence of between five and 15 years in prison.“My opinion is that there are circumstances in which it is at least possible that a woman could be charged with a felony,” said Lowell Pearson, a Husch Blackwell managing partner who has represented a number of Republican clients, including U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri.Pearson also served as general counsel in the office of former Gov. Matt Blunt, a Republican. Pearson said he was not involved in the drafting of the bill and had not analyzed it before a reporter called him on Wednesday.If Parson, a Republican, signs the measure as expected, the provision in question would take effect in August. A spokesman for the governor said in an email, “It is our understanding that HB 126 does not provide for any criminal penalties against a woman receiving an abortion.”Democratic prosecutors in Kansas City and St. Louis are also grappling with the language — and considering whether women could be charged.The measure bans abortions at the eighth week of a woman’s pregnancy, except in medical emergencies.The bill says: “Any person who knowingly performs or induces an abortion of an unborn child in violation of this subsection shall be guilty of a class B felony, as well as subject to suspension or revocation of his or her professional license by his or her professional licensing board.”“It seems to me — if a woman takes some sort of drug or does some other activity to herself, she would be potentially within that provision,” Pearson said.“I think it’s a pretty big reach to try to read that in a way that says the woman would be liable,” said Rep. Mary Elizabeth Coleman, R-Arnold, who is a lawyer and who helped draft the bill.“When you read the language, it’s clear that there’s no penalties except for those who cause an abortion to be induced or performed,” she said, referring to the doctors or nurse practitioners who perform the procedure.The bill goes on to say that a “woman upon whom an abortion is performed or induced in violation of this subsection shall not be prosecuted for a conspiracy to violate the provisions of this subsection.”“To be abundantly clear, there’s another sentence immediately following that says a woman shall not be charged with conspiracy,” Coleman said.But an exemption for conspiracy charges would not cover a woman who completes an abortion herself, detractors argue.“If I live in Sikeston (Missouri) and I go to Illinois, get my pills, and then take my pills in Missouri, I think I could be prosecuted under this — not for conspiracy but for inducing an abortion,” said Rep. Gina Mitten, D-Richmond Heights, who is an attorney.“My reading of the statute is that it’s only a physician that performs or induces the procedure that could be prosecuted,” said St. Charles County Prosecutor Timothy Lohmar, a Republican.“I guess it could be boiled down to an interpretation of what does the word ‘induce’ mean,” he said. “Can a woman induce her own abortion? I don’t know. From my reading, I don’t think that was the intent, from the language that was drafted.
“If I were to get a warrant application for a woman who is accused of inducing her own abortion, I don’t think that under the version of the statute that I could prosecute that,” he said.When asked whether they would enforce the pending abortion law, and whether prosecutors believed women could be charged, St. Louis-area Democratic prosecutors sent statements that did not answer either question.“We are currently examining the ramifications of the passage of recent abortion legislation on health care professionals who provide women health services in the city of St. Louis,” said Susan Ryan, a spokeswoman for St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kimberly M. Gardner.St. Louis County Prosecutor Wesley Bell said in a statement, “Roe v. Wade is the law of the land and has been settled law since 1973. It is infuriating that this fundamental constitutional principal — and the humanity of women — is being put into play for political purposes.”The state’s only abortion clinic is located in the Central West End, which is under Gardner’s jurisdiction.Rep. Ian Mackey, D-Richmond Heights, said a woman who had a miscarriage could be accused of having an abortion in violation of the law.
“I think that’s completely plausible,” said Mackey, an attorney.It would be less plausible that she would be charged in St. Louis, Mackey said.But, he said, in conservative counties around the state: “I think that there are prosecutors who would prosecute that. I think there are husbands and ex-boyfriends and abusive paramours who would allege that.”If the U.S. Supreme Court strikes down Roe v. Wade, Missouri’s abortion laws would become even tougher, outlawing all abortions except in cases of medical emergency.Samuel Lee, an anti-abortion lobbyist who helped guide the measure to the governor’s desk, said Democrats and others are trying to confuse the public and dissuade Parson from signing the bill.In recent days, abortion rights advocates have lit up Parson’s office with phone calls, and they have held protests around the state urging him to veto the bill. St. Louis County Executive Sam Page, in a meeting with the governor this week, urged Parson to veto the bill. But Parson has said he will sign it.“It’s simply not true,” Lee said of whether women who undergo an abortion could be charged. “These are just detractors who are trying to find any way to undercut either the governor signing the bill, or confusing the public for whatever reason.“The implication in the law is that it is someone performing or inducing an abortion upon someone else,” he said of who would be charged.When told that there did not appear to be an explicit prohibition against charging women undergoing an abortion, Lee said: “I am absolutely, 100 percent confident that no woman would ever be charged under this bill.”The legislation is House Bill 126.(tncms-asset)fdaf5220-7a75-11e9-8d5a-00163ec2aa77[0](/tncms-asset)

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Another round of strong storms expected Wednesday night, but risk to St. Louis area will be lower","May 22, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/another-round-of-strong-storms-expected-wednesday-night-but-risk/article_131fbb80-c838-5805-afcc-a8305e2b24bf.html,"Strong storms roared across the St. Louis area Tuesday night, toppling trees and drenching everything but causing no major damage.Tornado sirens sounded in waves across the region, but by about 10 p.m. the only big weather left was rain.The storms are part of a weather system moving across the Midwest that began last weekend and will continue through the week, according to the National Weather Service. After Tuesday's storms, the St. Louis area is expected to see scattered showers through the weekend, causing the Mississippi River near St. Louis to rise further. 

The St. Louis area could see more thunderstorms on Wednesday, but the risk is higher to the west and north. A National Weather Service map shows the St. Louis area at slight to marginal risk. The storms are capable of producing large hail, wind damage and thunderstorms, with the highest risk in a swath of western Missouri.
Attention & Retweet: Severe thunderstorms EXPECTED this evening. Portions of #mowx upgraded to MODERATE RISK. #ilwx #stlwx pic.twitter.com/fEXOl66PVK— NWS St. Louis (@NWSStLouis) May 22, 2019
 Meanwhile, the National Weather Service said a tornado that touched down during Tuesday night's storm had been confirmed and was rated as an EF-1, with maximum sustained winds around 100 mph. There was also a EF-1 tornado further west in Yucatan, Mo., about 45 minutes earlier.
While we weren't able to survey all the areas that may have had tornadoes last night, we did find tornadoes near Yucatan and Augusta MO. Both tornadoes were rated at an EF-1 with maximum estimated winds around 100 mph. Thankfully no one was hurt #mowx pic.twitter.com/kfzqS56fyS— NWS St. Louis (@NWSStLouis) May 22, 2019
 Augusta Fire Protection District Assistant Chief Paul Hopen said multiple trees fell across roadways, causing some structural damage around the city.There were no other tornado touchdowns confirmed by radar in the metro area, Doug Tilly, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service, said on Wednesday morning.Gov. Mike Parson declared a state of emergency as the state braced for severe weather through Wednesday that is expected to worsen flooding. Flash floods had occurred in several counties in southwest Missouri by Tuesday, sending four people to the hospital and requiring emergency response to rescue other people, according to the governor's office. The state of emergency prompts state agencies to coordinate with local authorities to monitor river levels and fight flooding. Tuesday's fast-moving storm arrived in the metro area about the time that thousands of people were gathering downtown for the St. Louis Blues game. The St. Louis Cardinals game was postponed because of the inclement weather and rescheduled as an interleague, day-night doubleheader Wednesday. 
Upated for timing of severe weather on Tuesday. #stlwx #mowx #ilwx #midmowx pic.twitter.com/aOvLAw8eC6— NWS St. Louis (@NWSStLouis) May 20, 2019
 The area’s flooding woes are not over, according to the weather service. Heavy rainfall could cause flooding in areas along the Mississippi River, including in the St. Louis area. Scattered showers are expected through the rest of the week. 
A flood warning issued Monday morning will continue until further notice, officials said. The National Weather Service advises people in the St. Louis area to never drive cars or other vehicles through flooded areas, as the water could be too deep to safely pass through.The Mississippi River has been above flood level of 30 feet for weeks, reaching 41.7 feet on May 6, said Patrick Walsh, with the National Weather Service in St. Louis. That's the seventh highest crest in the records. The river had since receded to about 35 feet by Tuesday, but was expected to rise back to 41 feet or higher by Memorial Day, Walsh said.Authorities in Lincoln County urged evacuation of an area east of Highway 79 from Foley south to the southern section of the Winfield Main Levee. The river is expected to peak at 34.9 feet in the area of Winfield, where a 300-foot wide breach in the Winfield Main Levee remains from flooding earlier this month.""If you live or work in these areas, you are urged in the strongest possible terms to evacuate,"" Lincoln County Emergency Management said in an alert. ""The breach in the levee means you will experience the rise of the Mississippi River as it happens, with little or no lag time.""
Aubuchon Road in the Hazelwood area was closed due to the possibility of a levee breach in the area that could endanger motorists.On Monday evening, Gov. Mike Parson announced that President Donald Trump had granted a request for a disaster declaration for 13 Missouri counties that were impacted by storm and flooding damage from March 11 to April 16. The affected counties are Andrew, Atchison, Buchanan, Carroll, Chariton, Holt, Mississippi, New Madrid, Pemiscot, Perry, Platte, Ray and Ste. Genevieve.The declaration grants millions of dollars in federal assistance to these counties to assist with bridge and road repair, as well as making up some of the cost of emergency response during the storms and flooding. It also makes assistance available from the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s Hazard Mitigation Program, which is designed to reduce long-term risk to people and property due to natural hazards, according to a statement from the governor’s office.David Carson and Kim Bell of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch contributed to this report.• St. Louis weather truisms• Find the latest forecast• Flooding forecast: How high will floodwaters rise? • Check local traffic conditions• Road conditions and closures from MoDOT

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Editorial: Parson should leave Missouri's motorcycle helmet law firmly strapped in place.,"May 22, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-parson-should-leave-missouri-s-motorcycle-helmet-law-firmly/article_fe36004d-10f9-51b0-99b9-643517d5688b.html,"If Gov. Mike Parson signs a bill to remove Missouri’s motorcycle helmet requirement, it will cost lives. That’s virtually undebatable. Missouri currently requires all riders and passengers on motorcycles to wear helmets. The Legislature passed a bill this session to make the rule apply only to riders under age 18, allowing adults to ride with the wind in their hair — and, in some cases, inevitably, their brains on the asphalt.While America has steadily moved toward near-universal seat belt laws for years, trends in motorcycle helmet laws have been all over the road. Helmets-for-all laws like Missouri’s are currently in force in 19 states. Almost 30 others require them only for minors, leaving the vast majority of riders unprotected.With states variously loosening and tightening their helmet laws over the years, it’s possible to track trends in helmet effectiveness that essentially confirm common sense. As the Post-Dispatch’s Kurt Erickson reported Wednesday, Texas alone has been a case study in the difference helmets make.

The Lone Star State saw a 35 percent jump in motorcycle fatalities after it did what Missouri is contemplating. In 1977, the state changed its universal-helmet law to cover only minors. When Texas reinstated its universal helmet law in 1989, deaths dropped by 11 percent. When it again changed the law in 1997 to cover only riders younger than 21, deaths again jumped, by 31 percent.Helmet-law opponents argue numbers like that merely reflect fewer riders riding where there are helmet laws, and that helmets can cause accidents by impeding riders’ vision. Neither claim has much validity, studies have found.
But the primary argument made against helmet laws isn’t about data, anyway. It’s about the philosophical premise that people have the right to increase their risk of death if they want to. As one Missouri anti-helmet lobbyist told the Post-Dispatch: “It’s about freedom.”
However, the implication that going helmetless affects only the rider is a myth. A study by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on the societal costs of motorcycle accidents — costs like immediate and long-term medical expenses that often get passed onto the taxpayers, lost productivity for the economy and higher insurance rates for everyone — are demonstrably higher in motorcycle accidents with unhelmeted riders.The reason is simple: With unhelmeted riders, head trauma is more often part of the equation. “For victims of serious head injury,” the report says, “acute hospital care might be only the first stage of a long and costly treatment program. For many crash victims, lost wages from missed work days will outweigh medical costs.”As Parson decides what to do with this legislation, he should imagine how he would come down on a bill seeking to give Missourians a specific legal right to publicly engage in games of Russian roulette. Because that’s effectively what this bill does."
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Abortion bills are regressive and unconstitutional,"May 22, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/mailbag/abortion-bills-are-regressive-and-unconstitutional/article_8e7bcbd1-3ba9-5e2a-a5de-aba47eb9cc64.html,"The bills passed in Georgia, Alabama and Missouri are anathema to the majority of Americans. These bills seek not to protect lives, but to subjugate women by criminalizing our health care decisions. These draconian laws are in direct violation of our basic human and constitutional rights.Whether to terminate a pregnancy or not is a personal, private decision into which no government has the right to interfere. In the United States, every woman has the unalienable right to her own life, liberty and the pursuit of her own happiness.

These regressive measures are also racist and classist, denying poor women and women of color the freedoms that wealthy white women will continue to exercise.
They will have a disastrous impact on our economy and result in the deaths of many women.
I demand that Gov. Mike Parson vetoes these misogynist attacks on women’s rights.Kathleen Corbett-Otto • Overland"
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Across US, and in St. Louis, activists protest new wave of abortion bans","May 21, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/across-us-and-in-st-louis-activists-protest-new-wave/article_9adcbf86-4564-5908-b7c3-5c219a131a7d.html,"At the U.S. Supreme Court, statehouses and other sites across the nation, abortion rights supporters held rallies Tuesday in opposition to the wave of sweeping abortion bans being enacted this year in Midwestern and Southern states.Organizers — including Planned Parenthood, NARAL Pro-Choice America and the American Civil Liberties Union — predicted tens of thousands of people would attend hundreds of events scheduled in all 50 states.The ""National Day of Action to Stop the Bans"" came in response a near-total ban on abortion recently signed into law in Alabama, as well as bills enacted or nearing passage in Mississippi, Kentucky, Ohio, Georgia and Louisiana aimed at banning abortion once a fetal heartbeat is detected. That can happen in the sixth week of pregnancy, before many women know they're pregnant. Missouri lawmakers have passed an eight-week ban.

None of the laws has taken effect, and all will likely be blocked while legal challenges play out. Ban supporters hope one or more of the measures might reach the Supreme Court and possibly trigger reversal of the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion nationwide.In St. Louis, a crowd stretched from the west side of Luther Ely Smith Park, in the shadow of the Arch, across Fourth Street to the steps of the Old Courthouse.Their cheers, and boos for politicians who passed the ban, were joined by the honks and raised thumbs of passing drivers.Signs warned that ""Signers of HB126 will pay at the polls"" and said ""Women will die. Republicans don't care.""Speakers, including The Rev. Traci Blackmon; St. Louis Treasurer Tishaura Jones; Rep. Cora Faith Walker, D-Ferguson; two OBGYNs and Alison Dreith, deputy director of Hope Clinic for Women; told the crowd that the bill would was about controlling women and would not stop abortions, but simply prevent safe access to them.They passed out Gov. Mike Parson's phone number and implored the crowd to ""flood"" his office with calls and vote those who supported the ban out of office.At the end of the organized event, some protesters filled Fourth Street, blocking traffic and chanting ""veto"" and ""we won't go back"" for about 20 minutes before leaving.In Washington, a demonstration outside the Supreme Court drew hundreds of protesters and several Democratic presidential candidates. Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, in addition to Reps. Eric Swalwell of California and Tim Ryan of Ohio, were among the attendees as multiple members of Congress spoke to a crowd that hoisted signs defending abortion rights.""I cannot tell you how important this moment in our country's history is,"" Gillibrand said. ""Do not allow this moment to lapse without putting everything you can behind it. Organize, advocate and vote.""Some protesters carried purple signs that declared, ""Abortion is a human right."" Among their chants: ""No church/No state/Women must decide their fate.""Lauri Ploch, 67, came from Alexandria, Virginia, with a sign depicting a drawing of a uterus and the message, ""Mine, not yours.""Ploch recalled the conflict over birth control and abortion rights in her youth, and suggested that her generation mistakenly believed that such struggles were in the past.""I got complacent for a little while. I think a lot of people did,"" she said. ""Right now we need to really get up in their faces and show that we are ready to fight to keep our rights.""
In Atlanta, several hundred protesters jammed onto the steps of the Georgia statehouse.Chants of ""Vote them out!"" and ""My body, my right!"" blared through a loudspeaker as passing drivers honked their horns in support. One woman carried a coat hanger with a sign that read, ""Not going back.""Brandi Borgwat, 42, drove about 30 minutes from her home in Woodstock, Georgia, to join the protests.""I didn't protest before because it sounded so insane that I didn't believe it would pass,"" Borgwat said of Georgia's new law. It's scheduled to take effect on Jan. 1, but opponents have vowed to sue to block it.In St. Louis, several hundred protesters gathered in a park between the Gateway Arch and the historic courthouse where the Dred Scott case decision that deemed black slaves as property, not citizens, was heard.
Katie Lorentz, a 19-year-old college student, said she worries that if she ever needs an abortion she'll be criminalized.""It puts a lot of women in danger,"" Lorentz said of the new law. ""States with strong anti-abortion laws have higher women mortality rates and infant mortality rates.""Ashley Buck, 30, a waitress from St. Louis, held a cardboard sign that read, ""I'm a Pro-Choice Mom"" on one side and ""Ask Me About My 2 Abortions — I Am Not Ashamed"" on the other. She said she had one at age 16, and another at age 27.""My choice,"" Buck said.That same message was echoed by several hundred people gathered in the Utah State Capitol Rotunda. Their chant: ""My body, my choice!""Utah legislators recently passed a ban on abortions after 18 weeks but have agreed not to enforce the ban as a court challenge plays out.In the crowd of abortion rights activists, one counterprotester, Deanna Holland, stood with an anti-abortion sign urging people to care for unborn fetuses.Robert Patrick of the Post-Dispatch contributed to this report.Associated Press reporters Ben Nadler and Sanya Mansoor in Atlanta, Ashraf Khalil and Elena Schor in Washington, Morgan Smith in Salt Lake City and Jim Salter in St. Louis contributed to this report.EDITOR'S NOTE: An earlier version of this story gave an incorrect title for Alison Dreith, deputy director of Hope Clinic for Women.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri abortion law is against Constitution,"May 21, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/mailbag/missouri-abortion-law-is-against-constitution/article_58c14113-a3d5-5376-b888-d388b6c75665.html,"This extreme and dangerous Missouri legislation criminalizes abortion as early as eight weeks, before some women even know they’re pregnant, with no exception for rape or incest. The bill now goes to the desk of Gov. Mike Parson, who has made clear his willingness to sign.

For many Missourians, the unconstitutional ban would remove access to safe abortion. It violates Supreme Court precedent in an attempt to ultimately overturn Roe v Wade. Abortion is an incredibly personal and sometimes complex decision that should and must occur between a pregnant woman, her family and her doctor — not categorically decided by politicians inexperienced in matters of reproductive and maternal health care.

In a state already lacking health care and an abysmal maternal mortality rate that exceeds that of some developing nations, Gov. Parson and anti-choice state lawmakers have made the express decision to fuel the continuing decay of health care in Missouri. They also uphold the egregious claim that the government deserves a hand in the bodily autonomy and deeply personal parenting choices of pregnant Missourians. I call on the governor to reject this unconstitutional ban.Alex Keeley • Kirkwood"
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri officials reject bid to overturn medical marijuana contract,"May 21, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-officials-reject-bid-to-overturn-medical-marijuana-contract/article_93d43069-2eff-55cc-8e9a-a375dcefff7e.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — Missouri officials have rejected a politically connected company’s challenge of a contract to help run the state’s fledgling medical marijuana program.In a decision issued Monday, Gov. Mike Parson’s administration said it was denying a protest by BioTrackTHC, which said the state should not have awarded a contract to a competitor in April because it could contain hidden costs.At issue is a contract to register patients, license facilities and track marijuana from seed to sale.

BioTrackTHC suggested Metrc was able to submit a lower bid to the state because it would charge additional fees to growers and dispensaries.In rejecting the protest, the state said its contract with Metrc does not allow the company to charge additional fees. The 14-page decision, written by Karen Boeger, director of the state's purchasing division, said no further action would be taken.Although it lost its bid to overturn the state’s decision for the estimated $5 million job, BioTrackTHC called the protest a win for the industry because Metrc will not be able to charge additional fees.“We are pleased that the results of the protest reaffirm that additional variable costs to the licensees or the State will not be allowed,” the company said in a statement Tuesday.A spokesman added that the company does not intend to take the matter to court.
“We are satisfied and do not intend to pursue any further action regarding this contract,” said Jeffrey Gonring.As part of its bid to land the state contract, BioTrackTHC hired lobbyist Steve Tilley, a former speaker of the Missouri House. Tilley is co-sponsoring a fundraiser for Parson on Tuesday.
Voters approved Amendment 2 in November, making Missouri the 33rd state to legalize marijuana for medicinal use. Sales are to start early next year. Tax proceeds and licensing fees are supposed to go into a newly created veterans health care fund, which is expected to generate about $20 million per year.BioTrack and Metrc are among the top operators vying to help states administer their marijuana programs. Metrc has contracts with at least 10 states, while BioTrack has seven.In some states, different companies handle the various aspects of operating a medical marijuana program. But Missouri wants one company to do most of the information technology set-up for its licensing and tracking system. The contract with Metrc, if it survives the protest, will run for five years.Missouri is required by law to approve at least 60 commercial growers,86 facilities that manufacture marijuana-infused products and 192 dispensary licenses — 24 dispensaries for each of Missouri’s eight congressional districts.The St. Louis area will probably have more than 48 dispensaries. Two congressional districts cover St. Louis and St. Louis County and parts of St. Charles, Jefferson and Franklin counties.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Without helmet requirement, Missouri likely to see more motorcycle deaths","May 21, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/without-helmet-requirement-missouri-likely-to-see-more-motorcycle-deaths/article_5f909097-bb3f-5fdf-a3b9-77c6b05f6b64.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — The number of motorcycle riders who die in Missouri is likely to increase if Gov. Mike Parson signs off on a new helmet law this summer.According to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, states that have approved laws similar to the bill Missouri lawmakers sent Parson last week have seen fatalities increase by more than a third.“When states enact universal helmet laws, deaths, injuries and medical costs go down. When they repeal those laws, the reverse often happens,” the institute noted in its 2017 annual report.

Before adjourning for the summer on Friday, the House and the Senate approved legislation that would require motorcycle riders under the age of 18 to wear protective headgear. That means adults will be able to go without helmets, as long as they can prove they have health insurance.The legislation has been on the wish list of motorcycle rights groups for years, but it has never made it to a governor’s desk.Tony Shepherd, lobbyist for A Brotherhood Aimed Toward Education, or ABATE, said getting the helmet law across the finish line came as a surprise given its long history of failing.“We are stoked,” the 62-year-old O’Fallon, Mo., resident said. “We’re still in disbelief.”The original sponsor of the proposal is Sen. Eric Burlison, a Springfield Republican who had backed similar legislation during his tenure in the House.The measure awaits Parson’s signature. As a member of the House in the 2000s, Parson twice voted in favor of abolishing the state’s helmet laws. If approved, the change would take effect Aug. 28.Shepherd attributed the win to a new mix of lawmakers in the Senate and the fact that the legislation was just one provision in a larger mix of transportation-related changes that were included in one bill.“It just happened to come at the right time,” Shepherd said.
In the past, there has been resistance largely in the Missouri Senate because operating a motorcycle tends to be more hazardous than operating a car.According to National Highway Transportation Safety Administration, 1,859 motorcyclist lives were saved in 2016 because they were wearing helmets. In addition, if all riders had worn helmets, an additional 802 lives would have been saved, the report notes.According to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, helmets reduce the risk of head injuries from motorcycle crashes by 69 percent and deaths by 37 percent.
Currently, 19 states and the District of Columbia have universal helmet laws requiring all motorcyclists to wear a helmet. Twenty-eight states require only some motorcyclists to wear a helmet. Three states — Illinois, Iowa and New Hampshire — do not have a motorcycle helmet law.According to the institute, when California imposed a helmet law covering all riders in 1992, the number of motorcyclist fatalities dropped by 37 percent.When Texas changed its law in 1977 to require helmets only for riders younger than 18, the state saw a 35 percent increase in motorcycle fatalities. The Lone Star State reinstated its helmet law in 1989 and saw serious injury crashes decrease by 11 percent.In 1997, Texas again weakened its helmet law, requiring helmets only for riders younger than 21. Operator fatalities increased 31 percent in the first full year following the repeal.Shepherd downplayed the statistics, saying he’s crashed his bike with and without a helmet.“It’s about freedom. We want to get the government out of our lives. We’re not outlawing helmets. We are letting you decide,” Shepherd said.The legislation is Senate Bill 147.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Missouri Democrats, in political exile, want GOP to pay price for 'extreme' abortion bill","May 21, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-democrats-in-political-exile-want-gop-to-pay-price/article_42363f02-39f0-51c4-a5a3-bccc9911487e.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — House Minority Leader Crystal Quade said on the last day of the legislative session that she was sorry there were too few Democrats in the capital city to stop a GOP-backed bill that would ban most abortions.“I’m sorry,” Quade, choking up on the House floor, said Friday to abortion rights activists gathered in the Capitol. “I’m sorry there aren’t enough of us in this chamber to stop this. I’m sorry you’re viewed as second-class citizens. Now it’s up to you to change this.”On Saturday, Quade, D-Springfield, sent a fundraising email to her supporters, asking them to donate to her campaign. Democrats control fewer than one-third of state House and Senate seats.

So, in exile, the party is casting the bill — pending before Republican Gov. Mike Parson — as extreme. There are no exemptions allowing abortions in cases of incest or rape. Abortions would be banned at the eighth week of a pregnancy, the only exception being for medical emergencies.And, if the U.S. Supreme Court would overturn Roe v. Wade, nearly all abortions would be made illegal, according to the bill. The only exception would be for medical emergencies.Parson has said he will sign the bill, but it’s still unclear when he will do so.“By signing HB 126, Governor Parson is telling survivors of rape, incest and human trafficking that the whole system is against you,” Auditor Nicole Galloway, a Democrat considering challenging Parson in 2020, said in a statement.“Not only are Governor Parson and Republicans in Jefferson City out of step with the majority of Missourians, they don’t care about women’s health, re-victimizing survivors, or the law,” Galloway said.

When asked why he would sign the bill, given that there are no exceptions for rape or incest, Parson first said that he would sign it because that was the version the Legislature sent him. He later said he believed all life was valuable, regardless of how it was conceived.Jean Peters Baker, chairwoman of the state Democrats, said the bill was “far too extreme to the majority of Missourians” — an angle that may resonate with some of Missouri’s conservative-leaning electorate, who may be ambivalent toward total abortion bans.President Donald Trump said over the weekend he supported a woman’s right to an abortion in cases of rape or incest — a view that, according to a Gallup tracking poll, is likely more in line with national public opinion than the stance the Missouri bill takes.In 2018, 18% of Americans polled believed abortions should be outlawed in all circumstances, according to Gallup.In the same poll, 29% of respondents said abortion should be legal in all circumstances, while 50% said it should be legal only under certain circumstances — suggesting most people have mixed views on the procedure, and that they do not agree with either extreme in the abortion debate.Missouri’s electorate has tended to be more conservative than the nation as a whole, but the near-total ban could signal trouble for some suburban Republicans, where voters have been more receptive to Democrats in recent election cycles.In his St. Louis County district, Rep. Shamed Dogan said, many constituents have nuanced views on abortion.Dogan, of Ballwin, was the only Republican to vote against Missouri’s abortion measure last week. He said he did so because there were no rape or incest exceptions.“I think I’ve only gotten two or three people voicing their opposition who were constituents,” Dogan said. He said more than 100 constituents have contacted him supporting the vote.“These weren’t form emails,” he said. “These were individuals writing in on their own. A lot of them had personal stories. None of these emails was a copy-and-paste.”
Whether abortion resonates as an issue in November 2020 obviously is yet to be determined.Voters rejected a Republican-backed right-to-work law by a wide margin in August 2018. But in November 2018, Democrats did not gain any ground in the Republican-controlled Legislature.On the other hand, Democrat Mike Revis was able to snag a GOP-held Jefferson County House seat in a February 2018 special election in which right-to-work dominated debate.In November, voters in the 99th District in St. Louis County — which borders Dogan’s 98th District — will choose a replacement to former Rep. Jean Evans, R-Manchester, in a special election. She resigned earlier this year to become the executive director of the Missouri Republican Party.
Evans has said she was able to pull off victories in the swing district by knocking on doors and winning over independent voters.Evans won 53% of the vote last year, under-performing then-Democratic U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill, who won 55% of the vote in the 99th District.Democrat Mark Osmack has filed paperwork to run in 2020 against state Sen. Andrew Koenig, R-Manchester.The 15th Senate District includes much of west St. Louis County, including Dogan’s district. Koenig handled the abortion bill in the Senate, and is one of the chamber’s most conservative members.Democrats are betting voters will find Koenig out of step with the district.Indeed, Democrats’ performance in the Kansas City and St. Louis suburbs in 2018 represented one very minor silver lining in an otherwise dismal year for the party.Though McCaskill lost in 2018, and Democrats lost three seats in the Legislature, they also gained three suburban House seats — one centered in Maryland Heights and part of St. Charles, and two in Kansas City.U.S. Rep. Ann Wagner, R-Ballwin, kept her seat in Congress — but narrowly, by fewer than 5 percentage points. Since then, Democrats have said they would spend more resources on the suburban St. Louis seat in 2020.Wagner has started aggressively fundraising in anticipation of the race.The legislation is House Bill 126.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"In his first session as Missouri governor, Parson scores wins","May 19, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/in-his-first-session-as-missouri-governor-parson-scores-wins/article_70e13c18-f192-5da6-ad7f-07f764b7439b.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — When Gov. Mike Parson took over as Missouri’s 57th chief executive nearly a year ago, he pledged to bring calm to a state roiled by the scandal of his predecessor, fellow Republican Eric Greitens.Although the closing month of the legislative session was a rocky ride for the rookie governor, Parson emerged from the five-month legislative session with much of his agenda intact.His so-called “workforce development” push won support after he paired it with a package of subsidies for the General Motors truck and van plant in Wentzville. Lawmakers also delivered on their promise to further restrict abortion in the state, giving Parson some conservative bonafides after being attacked from the right for some of his policy proposals.

And, although his original plan was pared down by Republicans in the House, he received permission to borrow $301 million to fix bridges across the state.“I applaud House and Senate leaders for partnering on the shared priorities of infrastructure and workforce development. Thanks to their leadership we were able to pass a comprehensive economic development strategy for growth across Missouri and take a substantial first step to meeting our state’s infrastructure needs,” Parson said Friday.The five-month session marked Parson’s second significant challenge as governor. While he had largely succeeded in stabilizing state government after the Greitens turmoil, he hadn’t yet navigated a session from the second floor.Parson, a former member of the House and Senate, put that experience to use in his dealings with lawmakers. And, he put together a staff that also brought experience to the table.His team, assembled on the fly after the departure of Greitens, proved deft in working the marble-lined corridors of the House and Senate.Led by chief of staff Aaron Willard and chief legislative director Justin Alferman, the duo sent sometimes recalcitrant lawmakers a strong message: Parson was not going to budge on certain issues, so either get on board or step to the side.“Last year when I became governor, I’m not sure what any of us expected. I’m not sure I knew what I expected,” Parson told reporters Friday. “For the people that have worked in the governor’s office, under the circumstances that they come in here, and for us to hit the ground running back in June, and to stay focused on what the priorities were for this state. You know, I just appreciate the people that work in this office.”Among Parson’s biggest challenge was dealing with a bloc of six conservative senators, who sought to cast Parson as too moderate for their taste when it came to spending and some social issues.During a debate over the General Motors expansion proposal, the caucus suggested that Parson wanted access to a $25 million slush fund without legislative oversight.“Those funds have been plagued with inefficiencies, with mismanagement,” said Sen. Bob Onder, R-Lake Saint Louis, referring to similar funds in other states. “And with these slush funds, there’s always the allegation of pay-to-play corruption.”Asked whether the Conservative Caucus’ lengthy, overnight floor debate was little more than a tantrum over his policies, Parson refused to take the bait.Instead, he said the six members gave up when they realized the end of session plan, choreographed by Parson and Senate leadership, was based on a simple premise: Time.With a 6 p.m. Friday deadline looming and a sweeping abortion bill still unfinished, the caucus sat down, explaining that they didn’t want to block the abortion bill from being completed.“We were faced with a choice whether or not we wanted to continue that discussion on corporate welfare or move the discussion to something more positive on protecting life,” said Sen. Bill Eigel, R-Weldon Spring.After the vote, Parson left his second floor warren of offices to take a victory lap outside of the Senate chambers.“We felt like all along that we were on the right side of this issue and that time would prevail. And time did prevail,” Parson told reporters. “The people who spoke against it had every right to speak against it, but at the end of the day, I truly believe there’s a right thing to do, and that’s why we stayed where we were at.”The legislation includes a four-part plan to help existing businesses and draw new companies to the state, including the $10 million Fast Track program, which will provide scholarships for adult learners to pursue training for high demand industries.It also streamlines the state’s workforce training programs and creates a $25 million deal-closing fund to give Missouri a key negotiating tool to finalize business investment opportunities.And, it gives General Motors $50 million in tax credits if the automaker spends $750 million to upgrade its facility.On top of the workplace development plan, Parson cheered a strict new abortion law, passage of a $30 billion state budget and efforts to change the civil court system to make it better for businesses.
“I thought he had a very successful first session,” said House Speaker Elijah Haahr, R-Springfield. “He’s been very accessible. He understands both the House and the Senate and so he’s always been willing to communicate openly with us. And I’ve had a great working relationship with him.”Good, bad, uglyBut some conservatives remain critical of the governor.Rep. Justin Hill, R-Lake Saint Louis, slammed Parson’s push to borrow money to fix bridges, calling the idea “gross.”“I cannot understand how a Republican-elected majority is going back to the people to borrow money,” Hill said.By contrast, Parson won accolades from business groups for pushing the workplace development proposal across the finish line in the face of an intra-party spat.“Gov. Parson deserves a tremendous amount of credit for the leadership he demonstrated this session. He laid out an aggressive agenda early in session and took a hands-on approach in the Legislature to help it clear serious obstacles. He never backed down, he never wavered and the Missouri business community applauds Gov. Parson for his leadership this session,” said Dan Mehan, executive director of the Missouri Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
Democrats, too, say there is plenty to criticize — even though he has quelled the chaos brought on by his predecessor.“I think we can characterize it as the good, the bad and the ugly,” Rep. Gina Mitten, D-Richmond Heights, said Friday of Parson’s first legislative session. “I think the governor has had some big wins with the bonding bill, certainly with the GM changes.“Obviously there’s been bad, too. We’ve seen joinder and venue and more legislation that will close the courthouse doors to Missourians, particularly in rural areas. And the obvious ugly, which is the abortion legislation passed today.”The governor didn’t get everything he wanted. He had sought to reform the state’s low-income housing tax credit program, but a series of changes floundered in the final month of the session. A plan to fight opioid abuse by creating a prescription drug monitoring program ran aground in the Senate again over privacy concerns.Parson also failed to convince lawmakers to approve a framework for collecting online sales taxes after conservatives vowed to block any plan that did not include a corresponding decrease in income taxes.Parson, who runs a cattle operation in Bolivar, is expected to take a break from Jefferson City before he begins acting on the various pieces of legislation headed toward his desk.Tentative summer plans include attending the Paris Air Show in June and potentially heading overseas in August for a trade mission.He’ll also be moving out of the Governor’s Mansion, which is undergoing repairs, and into a house at a National Guard training base near Jefferson City.Parson also will be raising money for his 2020 campaign for a full four-year term.With state Auditor Nicole Galloway, the only Democrat elected to statewide office, showing signs that she is running for governor, Parson and his allies have raised over $3 million for the looming fight.On Tuesday, he’ll add more to his campaign chest at a fundraiser in St. Louis.Jack Suntrup of the Post-Dispatch contributed to this report.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Yes, GM subsidy is corporate welfare, but it's necessary in a competitive world","May 19, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/business/columns/david-nicklaus/yes-gm-subsidy-is-corporate-welfare-but-it-s-necessary/article_16b61472-0826-50c1-a929-9dbe11bd1ef1.html,"It’s hard to argue that a $50 million state subsidy for an automaker isn’t corporate welfare, but Rob Dixon doesn’t like the term.Dixon, Missouri’s director of economic development, had to defend Gov. Mike Parson’s administration against conservatives’ slings and arrows during debate over one of the governor’s priorities, a bill that offers General Motors incentives to invest $1 billion in its Wentzville plant.

Republican critics said the bill made the state pick economic winners and losers, using a new “deal closing fund” that amounted to a slush fund. It’s no such thing, Dixon says: The fund provides flexibility in handing out some Missouri Works tax credits, but still requires clawbacks if a company fails to create jobs.As for the corporate welfare label, the criticism applies to much of what Dixon’s department does, which is handing incentives to companies that invest in the state.Missouri competes with other states, and Dixon doesn’t see unilateral disarmament as an option. “Every state uses incentive tools,” he said. “Whether you like it or not, they are indisputably a part of the economic development competition across the country.”Indeed, Alabama dangled $700 million last year to win a joint Toyota-Mazda plant. Wisconsin offered Foxconn $4.8 billion to lure a giant electronics factory, although the company now seems likely to build something much smaller.Missouri has never played in such a pricey league, and the new economic development bill doesn’t change that. In fact, Dixon says, it allocates no more money than the state was spending under existing programs.“We think we’re being somewhat conservative and fiscally responsible with this program,” he said.The bill extends a program created in 2010 to encourage a Ford expansion in Kansas City. The GM subsidies could start in 2023, after the old law’s funding ends, at up to $10 million a year.
GM hasn’t said whether it will add jobs in Wentzville, but Dixon argues that keeping the current 3,500 jobs is critical. “They have a major impact on our state economy and on the everyday lives of millions of Missourians,” he said.GM contributes $2 billion a year to Missouri’s economy and supports 12,000 jobs at suppliers and other businesses, the state says.It’s important to note that GM is shrinking its overall production capacity. “You fight for those kinds of jobs every chance you get,” says Steve Johnson, chief executive of the St. Louis Regional Economic Development Alliance. “Talk to the people in Lordstown and see if they think you can take these jobs for granted.”He’s referring to Lordstown, Ohio, where GM ended auto production two months ago. The company also may close four other plants in North America.
Incentives, Johnson says, help make the case that GM should invest in Wentzville and not somewhere else. “The competition for capital within a company is fierce,” he said. “Sometimes communities assume that they’re not going to walk away, but expansion projects of this sort are every bit as competitive as a green-field project.”The new economic development bill does invest in people as well as companies: It provides financial aid for adults, over age 25, who return to school for education or training in a high-demand field such as computer science, nursing or welding.That part of the bill should improve the state’s long-term future, because most firms say a lack of suitable workers is their biggest barrier to growth.Meanwhile, subsidizing GM should ensure that the region doesn’t lose some of its highest-paying manufacturing jobs. Unfortunately, fierce competition for such jobs has made corporate welfare a necessary evil.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,The push for a statewide prescription drug monitoring program failed again. Why is Missouri the last holdout?,"May 19, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/lifestyles/health-med-fit/the-push-for-a-statewide-prescription-drug-monitoring-program-failed/article_54652e23-6de8-5541-a997-c4b18cfd4b97.html,"ST. LOUIS — Missouri retained its lonely title as the only state without a statewide prescription drug monitoring program — for the seventh year in a row — after the legislative session ended Friday.Patient advocates, politicians, experts and members of the medical community had hoped this would finally be the year Missouri would create a statewide electronic database designed to help spot the abuse of prescription drugs. After all, Republican Gov. Mike Parson had pushed for it and, more important, its longtime opponent was no longer in office to block it.But, because of ongoing fears about privacy violations tangled up with gun control, the bill never got a full Senate vote. And finance site WalletHub last week ranked Missouri third worst in the country for its drug use based on a review of arrests, overdose rates, opioid prescriptions and other measures.

Katie Reichard, a lobbyist with Missouri Primary Care Association who has been working in and around the Missouri Legislature for almost 15 years and previously pushed for the issue, said this proposal has bedeviled the state capital as none other while the opioid crisis continues to rage nationwide.“I’ve never seen anything take seven years to get anywhere, and especially something that’s going to be put into place to save lives.”Missouri’s cities, neighboring states and the federal government have been forced to create a patchwork of incomplete workarounds. Those include a voluntary program tracking patients’ prescriptions run by St. Louis County that receives federal funding and a statewide monitoring system put into place by former Republican Gov. Eric Greitens that tracks physicians’ prescriptions.And yet, the state cannot seem to legislate a complete fix. “It’s frustrating to watch the rest of the country get this done and watch Missouri be the last one,” said Dr. Sam Page, the St. Louis County prescription drug monitoring program architect and current St. Louis County Executive.To be sure, the databases don’t eliminate the ability of drug abusers to acquire prescription opioids. But the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has called such statewide patient monitoring databases “among the most promising state-level interventions” to improve opioid prescribing and protect at-risk patients.It’s an embarrassment Missouri can’t figure out its own statewide system, said St. Joseph pharmacist JulieMarie Nickelson. “No one in the pharmacy or medical world really understands it,” she said.Privacy, guns and oppositionWhile a drug-monitoring bill has been introduced every year in the Legislature since 2005, it was initially championed by the minority Democratic Party, which meant it didn’t have much of a shot at passing until 2012.Then New Hampshire approved a statewide program in 2012, leaving Missouri as the sole holdout. That pressure, combined with an uptick in awareness of drug abuse, led to a swell of bipartisan agreement.A statewide drug monitoring bill passed the Missouri House handily that year, then met its biggest adversary: Republican state Sen. Robert Schaaf, whose district stretched from Kansas City to St. Joseph along Missouri’s western border.Since then, Schaaf — who is also a family physician — filibustered or insisted on kill clauses that would never pass the House, citing his concerns over privacy and personal liberty issues along with his belief it was an ineffective tool. Year after year, his efforts defeated drug monitoring bills.Schaaf has said the risk of a database of patient information being hacked — and the government having access to the information — far outweighed the potential benefits. He also tapped into underlying fears of privacy violations, driven in part by a 2013 scandal over the Missouri Highway Patrol turning over a database of concealed weapons permit holders to a federal agent.“I’ve always been opposed to taking private citizens’ information and putting it on a government database to which many, many people have access,” he told Kaiser Health News. “My understanding is there is no computer information to which the NSA is not privy. How long is it going to be ’til this is used to pare down the number of people with concealed weapons or weapons at all?”By stoking privacy fears and connecting them to gun rights, Schaaf also helped tap into grassroots far-right opposition that lives on to this day. A YouTube video tweeted by opponents of prescription drug monitoring programs details how the St. Louis County system could be used in “passing your personal information on to the federal government, which could use it to infringe on your right to bear arms.”To date, the only reported hack has been of Virginia’s database, though it is unclear if the hackers were able to access medical records.Over the years, Missouri’s drug monitoring advocates, led by Republican Rep. Holly Rehder, unsuccessfully tried to assuage such concerns by offering amendments to delete records older than three years and to ensure medical information could not be tied to buying a gun. And while Schaaf did an about-face in 2017 and agreed to stop filibustering the proposal, he effectively killed it with his only stipulation: that all physicians be required to use it. That measure, which took away the inherent voluntary aspect of the program, failed in the House.“If they’re going to take our liberty away for something that’s never been proven to work, doctors have to use it,” Schaaf told Kaiser Health News.
The former head of the St. Louis County Health Department, Faisal Khan, who in 2017 helped start the voluntary county-based prescription drug monitoring program that now covers other portions of the state, claims the opposition goes deeper than what he called “totally unfounded” privacy concerns.“They view St. Louis County and St. Louis city and St. Louis, in general, as this liberal Democratic bastion that they don’t want anything to do with,” he said. “It’s the usual nonsense that we’re seeing around the country at the moment, and it’s stymying progress in the parts of the state where we need it the most.”But this year, Schaaf had hit his term limit of eight years in office and did not return to the Missouri Senate. Passing a prescription drug monitor program finally seemed within reach — until a group of six Republican state senators formed a new conservative caucus and filibustered yet again over the issue, citing the same privacy issues and civil liberties.“The conservative caucus has carried his torch on,” Reichard said.A series of workarounds Now, because the legislature has refused to move on the issue, cities, states and the federal government must continue to rely on the stopgaps they created to help address the opioid problem ravaging Missouri.Today, 72 jurisdictions have opted into St. Louis County’s voluntary prescription drug monitoring system so pharmacists and doctors could check a patient’s other prescriptions. It now covers 84% of the state’s population.
Even St. Joseph, one of the areas hardest hit by the opioid epidemic and where Schaaf lives, joined last year.For Nickelson, a pharmacist at Rogers Pharmacy in the city of about 76,000 people, the voluntary database means she no longer has to spend upward of 30 minutes on the phone tracking down whether a patient had prescriptions for drugs elsewhere.“It’s really helpful to us as it makes it so we can make sure that patients aren’t taking medications that interact and can increase risk for an overdose,” she said. “We just want to make sure our patients are safe, and we want to make sure medication that’s not necessary doesn’t get into the community.”Since her city’s voluntary PDMP has been in effect, she estimates she sees a handful fewer people each week who were doctor-shopping, a particular risk considering the pharmacy is less than 5 miles from the Kansas border.Missouri was a premier destination for pill-shopping, Page said, but that’s changed.“Our PDMP is first-class, as any in the country,” Page said. “We have gaps, but those will continue to fill in. If the state continues to not move forward with this, then St. Louis County will continue to do the right thing.”And while St. Louis County built its voluntary database in part with $200,000 from the U.S. Department of Justice, interstate sharing of the data with neighboring Illinois, Kansas and Oklahoma didn’t happen until February. Eight states border Missouri and more states are expected to collaborate with St. Louis County’s system this year. But data-sharing can occur only among states that have managed to bend or rewrite their regulations to accommodate the one state in the nation without a statewide program.Tennessee even created and passed legislation to allow it to communicate with the St. Louis County program while Missouri was still haggling over its PDMP bill, according to Spring Schmidt, acting head of the St. Louis County Department of Public Health.The system that Greitens created when governor, along with Express Scripts, to monitor physicians’ prescriptions for unusual patterns led to 50 referrals to the Missouri Healing Arts Board — the disciplinary board for medical practitioners in Missouri — for prescribing issues since March 2018, according to Missouri’s head of Health and Senior Services, Dr. Randall Williams.Ideally, Williams said, he would love to combine a statewide version of the voluntary PDMP system with Greitens’ physician-monitoring one, but he’s waiting on the legislation.Reichard can’t help but wonder why the state won’t join the rest of the nation in passing it.“I’m not saying do what everyone else is doing,” she said. “But if 49 other legislatures are saying ‘This is important, we need to save lives,’ I don’t understand why Missouri can’t find a way to compromise and do what’s best for its citizens.”Kaiser Health News is a nonprofit news service covering health issues.

Eric Greitens improperly used his office staff to work on his campaign's social media accounts.

The Kansas City Star reported that Schmitt's announcement concludes what is believed to be the last investigation into alleged wrongdoing during Greitens' administration. Greitens resigned last spring amid allegations of sexual misconduct and campaign finance violations.

Former Attorney General Josh Hawley, now a U.S. senator, began an investigation last year into whether taxpayer resources were illegally misused and whether Greitens and his staff violated Missouri's open records laws.Schmitt's office said Thursday that the issue is closed. New Gov. Mike Parson's office has signed agreements essentially promising that he and future governors will use best practices in using social media and email.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri voters to decide on more term limits,"May 18, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-voters-to-decide-on-more-term-limits/article_a825a688-7b56-56bd-98c4-7fbfcc3b6d22.html,"JEFFERSON CITY •  Missouri voters will decide next year whether to impose term limits on all statewide elected officials following action Friday by the Legislature.

Lawmakers gave final approval Friday to a proposed constitutional amendment to limit the lieutenant governor, secretary of state, auditor and attorney general to being elected to two four-year terms.

That would match term limits already in place for the governor and state treasurer. State legislators already are limited to two four-year terms in the Senate and four two-year terms in the House.The amendment on executive-branch term limits will appear on the November 2020 ballot unless Gov. Mike Parson schedules an earlier vote.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Near-total ban on abortion approved by Missouri House, heads to governor","May 18, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/near-total-ban-on-abortion-approved-by-missouri-house-heads/article_0c275d72-6791-5d70-8505-f3b4c524429f.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — Drawing jeers from activists seated in the Missouri House, lawmakers on Friday approved a sweeping piece of anti-abortion legislation, a bill that would ban most abortions in the state of Missouri.The final vote was 110-44, and the proposal now heads to Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican, who is expected to sign the measure.“We’re told abortion will not be safe if it is illegal. I’m here to tell you abortion is not safe,” said Rep. Mary Elizabeth Coleman, R-Arnold, one of the proposal’s main backers. “A person dies in every procedure.”

The proposal is designed to trigger a court challenge that the GOP sees as a way of overturning the landmark Roe v. Wade decision that made abortion legal nationwide. The measure has drawn nationwide scrutiny, and its passage brought an emotional end to Missouri’s five-month legislative session.The bill bans abortions in the state of Missouri at eight weeks of pregnancy, except when the life of the mother is threatened. There are no exceptions for rape, incest or human trafficking.“If we are in fact pro-life what kind of hypocrite would I be to not have a bill that is 100 percent pro-life?” asked Rep. Adam Schnelting, R-St. Charles, one of the main backers of the proposal.He said the purpose of the bill is to “optimize” life — his rationale for including exemptions in cases where the life of the mother is in jeopardy.The legislation also bans a woman from aborting a fetus that might have Down syndrome. It also requires both parents or guardians to be notified before minors can get an abortion, in most cases.The measure says anyone “who knowingly performs or induces an abortion” in cases that are not exempted by the legislation would be guilty of a Class B felony, which carries a minimum five-year prison sentence.If the Supreme Court overturns Roe vs. Wade, “in whole or in part,” the legislation states that all abortions would be made illegal except in cases of a medical emergency.The bill drew condemnation from Democrats, who control less than one-third of the state’s House seats.“Laundry bleach, acid, bitter concoction, knitting needles, bicycle spokes, ballpoint pens, jumping from the top of the stairs or the roof,” said Rep. Sarah Unsicker, D-Shrewsbury. “These are ways that women around the world who don’t have access to legal abortion perform their own.”Rep. Barbara Washington, D-Kansas City, said Missouri was not a pro-life state as long as children lose Medicaid coverage, or receive free and reduced-price lunches.“We support the death penalty in this state,” she said. “That is anti-life.”“This gives more rights to the rapists than it does the mother,” said Rep. Doug Beck, D-south St. Louis County. “Perpetrators of incest would have more rights.“This law is barbaric. We should rethink this,” he said.Rep. Rocky Miller, R-Lake Ozark, said that he “was involved” in an abortion when he was a young man.“I did not know what I was doing,” Miller said. He said he would vote for the anti-abortion measure. “Missouri takes a giant step forward to save life today. And I thank God for that.”Rep. Barry Hovis, R-Cape Girardeau, was met with hisses when he used the phrase “consensual rape” during debate.He said most of the sexual assaults he handled before retiring from law enforcement weren’t strangers “jumping out of the bushes” but instead “date rapes or consensual rapes.” Abortion-rights supporters who attended the debate hissed in response.As a vote on the abortion bill grew closer, dozens of activists started chanting from the chamber gallery.“When you lie, people die,” they shouted as doormen cleared the activists from the gallery. “Shame on you!”One Republican voted “no.” Rep. Shamed Dogan, R-Ballwin, said: “I really struggled with this one. I wanted to, as we talked about earlier, include rape and incest exceptions.”Rep. Steve Butz, D-St. Louis, who took an anti-abortion stance during a Democratic primary last year, ultimately voted “no” on the bill. He said it was because there were no exceptions included for rape or incest.
Missouri’s lawsMissouri already has some of the toughest abortion regulations in the country. There is one clinic in the state, in St. Louis’ Central West End neighborhood, but clinics also operate in the Metro East, in Granite City and Fairview Heights. Planned Parenthood operates a clinic in Kansas, near Kansas City, Mo.In 2017, lawmakers approved, and then-Gov. Eric Greitens signed into law, a round of abortion regulations that proponents said would protect the health and safety of women.It requires that doctors explain the risks of abortion to women 72 hours before an abortion is performed. The law added annual inspections of clinics and new whistleblower protections for employees of clinics, and boosted requirements for pathologists who provide services to abortion facilities.At the time, there was no clear conservative majority on the U.S. Supreme Court.But with Justice Brett Kavanaugh winning confirmation to the bench last year, anti-abortion activists in Missouri and elsewhere are hopeful the 5-4 conservative majority will reconsider the 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision.Encouraged by that majority, some conservative states are moving to ban most abortions outright.“Today, the Missouri House stood for the unborn,” House Speaker Elijah Haahr, R-Springfield, said in a statement. “Every child has an intrinsic value given to them by the Creator of life. The bold legislation we sent to the Governor’s desk is the strongest and most comprehensive pro-life bill in the country.”Abortion statistics
In Missouri, the number of recorded abortions has declined in recent years.In 2015, there were 4,311 abortions completed here on Missouri residents, according to the Department of Health and Senior Services.By 2017, the year the previous round of regulations took effect, there were 3,522 abortions completed here on Missouri residents, according to the department.At the same time, the number of abortions sought by Missouri residents out of state has increased.Out-of-state abortions sought by Missouri residents totaled 3,163 in 2015, according to the state. That total dipped in 2016 before increasing to 3,268 in 2017.Data on out-of-state abortions sought by Missouri women for 2018 were not available, a spokeswoman said, and some states do not report data back to the state DHSS, the spokeswoman said.Dr. Erin King, executive director of the Hope Clinic in Granite City, said the clinic will work with patients from conservative states such as Missouri who may lose access to abortion services.“Our doors remain open for any patient who needs abortion care,” she said in a statement. “We will do everything in our power to make sure that further barriers like expenses associated with seeking this care such as traveling long distances, time off from work, and childcare are lessened to the best of our ability.”The legislation is House Bill 126.The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"In bid to help tourism, Missouri lawmakers approve later school start date","May 18, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/in-bid-to-help-tourism-missouri-lawmakers-approve-later-school/article_05e2169b-3f52-53d6-b4f1-4346ac0425be.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — Over the objections of local school superintendents, Missouri lawmakers have approved legislation barring schools from starting classes before late August.The measure, which now heads to Gov. Mike Parson’s desk, was among scores of bills that moved through the House and Senate on the Legislature’s final day of the 2019 session.In all, the Republican-controlled chambers sent more than 40 bills to Parson, including one that would place strict limits on abortion in the Show-Me State.

The school starting date legislation would set the first day of school for K-12 districts no earlier than 14 days before the first Monday in September.It moved out of the House on a 116-25 vote Friday.Supporters, including Lt. Gov. Mike Kehoe, argue that earlier school start dates are affecting the tourism industry as more families end their summer vacations in early August.The change could give tourism-related businesses one more summer weekend to make money.The legislation was included in a package of school-related changes to state law that moved through both chambers on the final day of the Legislature’s annual session.In the coming school year, most St. Louis area school districts are set to start in mid-August. St. Louis Public Schools are to open Aug. 13.Among those favoring the prohibition were amusement park operators and lobbying groups representing hotel owners, campground owners and river outfitters.Opponents included the Missouri School Boards’ Association, which said the decision should be made locally.An early start can mean finishing a semester and squeezing in final exams before winter break. It allows more learning to take place before standardized tests are given in the spring. And it can prevent holding classes in June to make up for snow days after a harsh winter.The legislation is House Bill 604.Bridge funding planAlso heading to Parson’s desk is a short-term bridge funding plan sought by the governor after voters in November rejected an increase in the state’s motor fuel tax.The Republican-led House voted 107-31 in support of the plan, which is designed to pay for repairs to 215 bridges across the state.“This is not a long-term solution by any means,” said Rep. Kip Kendrick, D-Columbia. “We’ve put ourselves in a dangerous situation. We can’t go years without addressing a long-term solution.”Parson initially sought to borrow $351 million to finance the upgrades to be paid back over 15 years.Lawmakers balked and agreed to a $301 million bond package that would be paid out over seven years.“This has been truly a compromise solution,” said House Budget Chairman Cody Smith, a Jasper County Republican.Parson, a Republican, has made funding bridge projects a priority this legislative session, saying the state must find a long-term plan to fix the state’s roads and bridges.It will cost about $46.1 million a year to pay back the loan. Interest will amount to about $22.6 million.The proposal would devote $50 million in general revenue next fiscal year to jump-start the bridge replacement program. An additional $35 million would go toward a cost-share program for infrastructure improvements with counties and cities.It also allows the state to issue the bonds only if the state wins a federal infrastructure grant. One grant application seeks money to replace the Interstate 70 bridge in Rocheport; another application seeks money for bridge repairs.Officials have said the state is more likely to win federal money if it commits some of its own resources to the repairs. Parson has said that if the state devotes money toward the bridge repairs, it would free up dollars for road repairs.While the infusion of state and federal money would be a catalyst to repair long-term assets, the spending would not erase the state’s infrastructure backlog.
The legislation is Senate Concurrent Resolution 14.Motorcyle helmet lawThe House and Senate signed off on a package of transportation-related changes in state law, including one that would lift the requirement that all riders wear protective headwear.Motorcycle riders under the age of 18 would still need to wear a helmet. Those over 18 could go without if they have health insurance.During earlier debate, lawmakers agreed motorcyclists should wear helmets, but some said the choice should be a matter of personal freedom.“I think there’s a limit of what government should be involved in our lives,” Sen. David Sater, R-Cassville said.Opponents were quick to point out that drivers of other vehicles are subject to their own safety requirements and began listing statistics on motorcycle accidents.More than 5,000 motorcyclists died in 2017 according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The NHTSA, a branch of the Federal Department of Transportation, found the crashes result in billions of dollars in hospital bills each year, costs that are lower in states that require all motorcyclists to wear helmets.
“We’re going to be paying for this,” Sen. Bill White, R-Joplin said. “That’s where your freedom stops is when it enters my pocket book.”The legislation package, including other transportation provisions, passed 21-12. The House sent the legislation to the governor on a 94-46 vote.The legislation is SB 147.Vehicle emissions testThe House and Senate backed off a plan to end vehicle emissions tests, which have been taking place for decades in the city of St. Louis, and St. Louis, St. Charles, Jefferson and Franklin counties.Senate President Pro Tem Dave Schatz wanted to end the testing because air quality has improved in the region and newer cars emit less pollution.But, lawmakers refused because doing so could potentially cost the state millions of dollars in federal funding.Schatz, R-Sullivan, said he didn’t want to leave the Missouri Department of Transportation with a $211 million hole in its budget.Because of high ozone levels, the St. Louis region is the only area in Missouri where emissions testing is required when motorists go to renew their license plates. Automobiles are the largest source of the chemicals that form ozone, but factories, utilities, the petroleum industry and industrial solvents also contribute.Ozone is a respiratory irritant that can cause health problems, especially for children, the elderly and people with heart and lung diseases.In addition to potentially losing federal dollars, a fiscal analysis shows the state would lose $2.8 million in license fee receipts it collects to pay for the program.The emissions testing language was stripped out of a larger bill that includes an increase in driver’s license fees, to $6 from $3.50 for one year and to $12 from $7 for two years.Title transfer fees, instructional permits, chauffeur’s licenses and other specialty licenses would increase to $6 from $2.50.The proposal, sponsored by Rep. Jeff Knight, R-Lebanon, is designed to help license offices in rural areas cover increasing costs. Along with an increase in the minimum wage, the offices must use specific types of office equipment, Knight said.The fees have not been increased since 1999.In addition to boosting revenue for the office operators, the proposal would generate $22.4 million for the state’s highway fund. Cities would receive $4.5 million and counties would see a share of $2.9 million.The legislation is House Bill 499.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Editorial: Short takes on 'talking telegraphs' and deep-sea trash,"May 17, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-short-takes-on-talking-telegraphs-and-deep-sea-trash/article_50ef3fed-c8e8-55c6-85ee-e1dad2e174af.html,"Parson invokes invention of ‘talking telegraph’Missouri Gov. Mike Parson is expected to be the top ambassador touting this state’s hi-tech prowess and modern infrastructure capable of attracting new employers and investors. His six-minute interview on National Public Radio Wednesday accomplished exactly the opposite — not so much for anything he said but for the abysmal quality of the phone equipment he was using.The interview was almost intelligible at the start, but the longer it lasted, the more it sounded as if Parson were speaking through a long irrigation tube on his farm while crushing graham crackers into the mouthpiece. The connection quality degraded to the point where almost nothing was understandable.

We live in cost-conscious times, for sure. But it seems the governor’s office could spring for a few extra dollars to upgrade his phone so he doesn’t embarrass the state and invoke the olden days when Missourians communicated using a new device called the “talking telegraph.”Tree muggersA California couple wanted a massive, protected 180-year oak tree on their property to be in different spot. So they had it dug up and transplanted, killing it in the process. Fittingly, a judge has now fined them almost $600,000 for their little landscape project.For close to two centuries, the majestic tree stood in a wooded area north of San Francisco, on land now owned by Toni and Peter Thompson. Although there’s a conservation easement requiring the land to stay in its natural state, the couple wanted the tree, and two others, moved to another location. So they ignored the easement and brought in the backhoes, to disastrous outcome.In a searing ruling, Judge Patrick M. Broderick sided with the land trust and fined the couple $586,000 to fund restoration efforts. He cited their efforts to hide what they did and obstruct the investigation.The couple’s lawyer protested that they are “responsible, law-abiding citizens” who love the land. Funny way of showing it.Trump 2.0It appears college student John Lambert, a co-founder of the national campus group Students for Trump, is perfectly suited for promoting the ethos of our 45th president: Lambert has been charged with posing online as a high-powered lawyer to fleece unwitting “clients.”During and after the 2016 election, Lambert became a celebrity for young fans of President Donald Trump. He traveled to various college campuses, touting Trump’s policies and pushing back on the narrative that students tend to oppose him.But federal prosecutors allege that Lambert, operating out of North Carolina, invented an online persona named Eric Pope, described as a prominent New York attorney, and used it to bilk unwary people seeking legal services out of tens of thousands of dollars.In Trump’s younger days, he used to talk himself up to reporters while pretending to be a non-existent spokesman named John Barron. He also was sued for ripping off students of the now-defunct Trump University. If Lambert beats the rap, maybe there’s a cabinet post for him.Deep-sea dumpsterThe deepest ocean dive ever undertaken has yielded some intriguing sights, and a depressing one: human trash, in the furthest depths that human eyes have ever glimpsed.
Explorer Victor Vescovo recently unveiled details of his history-making dive in the southern Pacific Ocean, part of a mission to chart the deepest parts of the globe. Inside a submersible called The Limiting Factor, Vescovo descended seven miles, to the bottom of the Pacific’s Marianna Trench. It is the deepest manned sea dive on record.In those never-before-seen depths, Vescovo came across what are believed to be several previously unknown species of fish.He also came across a plastic bag and some candy wrappers.An estimated 100 million tons of trash are in the world’s oceans, with some 8 million more added every year.
Crime shouldn’t payFormer St. Louis County Executive Steve Stenger had been on track to eventually get a county pension despite pleading guilty to corruption in office. But as the Post-Dispatch’s Jeremy Kohler reports, County Council member Tim Fitch wants the council to create a law like the one that already governs Missouri state employees: If they’re convicted of a felony committed in relation to their official duties, they forfeit their pensions.Stenger will be sentenced Aug. 9 and could face three to four years in prison. Yet under current statute, that combined with his resignation in disgrace from office wouldn’t prevent him from collecting his county pension as early as 2032.As Fitch puts it: “If he was committing crimes while he was in his elected position, why would taxpayers want to pay his pension for the rest of his life?” Good question.The next small stepHalf a century after Neil Armstrong first walked on the moon, NASA is planning to release some long-sealed samples of moon rocks to scientists to be tested with technology that wasn’t available when they were first brought to Earth.Much of the more than 800 pounds of rocks and soil collected during the six Apollo moon missions from 1969 through 1972 remain vacuum sealed or frozen, untouched by human hands on Earth.Testing on some samples offered clues about the origins of both the moon and Earth. Other material was preserved on the assumption that future scientists with advanced technology could make deeper discoveries.Scientists will test samples for trapped water molecules and other secrets — an apt way to mark the July 20 anniversary of Armstrong’s first walk 50 years ago.Of course, they aren’t unsealing all of it. Who knows what scientists 50 years from now might be able to learn?EDITOR'S NOTE: The final item in Short Takes has been updated to correct the date of the first moon walk."
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Most St. Louis aldermen blast Legislature's move to ban most abortions,"May 17, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/most-st-louis-aldermen-blast-legislature-s-move-to-ban/article_b1d894ff-8c7b-5be5-82f5-232b2874f13f.html,"ST. LOUIS  •  Aldermanic President Lewis Reed and 23 of the 28 ward aldermen on Friday issued a statement blasting what they called the ""draconian"" bill to ban most abortions passed by the Missouri Legislature.""This alarming bill seeks to ban a woman's access to safe and legal abortions in our state and outlaws abortion just eight weeks into pregnancy, which is often much sooner than a woman even knows she is pregnant,"" the statement said.The statement, issued after the Board of Aldermen held its regular weekly meeting, also complained that the Legislature has failed to consider or pass key initiatives to improve health care for women and children such as expansion of Medicaid.

The state measure was given final approval about the same time by the Missouri House and sent to Gov. Mike Parson, a supporter, for his signature.
The aldermanic statement also said state lawmakers haven't dealt with the state's rates of death and injury from gun violence, an ""out of control"" incidence of syphilis and the ""opioid crisis.""""If Governor Parson and the Missouri General Assembly are truly concerned about Missouri women's health and 'life', we suggest starting with any of these urgent problems in our state,"" the group said.
City Treasurer Tishaura Jones, a former state representative, also endorsed the statement. Alderman Christine Ingrassia of the 6th Ward gathered support for the statement.The five aldermen who didn't back the statement were Joe Vollmer of the 10th Ward, Larry Arnowitz of the 12th, Tom Oldenburg of the 16th, Joe Roddy of the 17th and Joe Vaccaro of the 23rd.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Rep. Bruce Franks quitting Missouri House, cites family and mental health issues","May 17, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/rep-bruce-franks-quitting-missouri-house-cites-family-and-mental/article_7cc0982b-60ae-56a4-b4b7-4b9d48fffd22.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — A high-profile member of the St. Louis-area delegation in the Missouri Legislature is calling it quits after less than three years in office.Rep. Bruce Franks, who rode into the Capitol after challenging the status quo in a contested election in 2016, said he is stepping down with a year left in his term to tend to his mental health and his family.“It’s about taking a step back,” Franks said in an interview Thursday.

Franks announced his decision to his colleagues in the Missouri House on the second-to-last day of the legislative session.The 34-year-old activist and community organizer moved into the public eye in 2014 during protests over a Ferguson police officer’s fatal shooting of Michael Brown.He parlayed that notoriety in 2016 to unseat Democrat Penny Hubbard in the 78th House District, which takes in downtown St. Louis, most of the near north side and parts of the city’s south side.In Jefferson City, Franks worked to bridge the rural-urban divide that dominates policy discussions under the Dome. His floor speeches often brought hushed tones to the Legislature’s lower chamber as he called for compromise and comity.He said he was proud of winning support from the Republican majority to fund youth programs in St. Louis during his abbreviated tenure.“I was able to build some bridges,” Franks said. “But I feel like I can be more effective outside the system.”“I am not resigning my role as a leader in my community,” he added.In 2017, Franks helped lead protests after former St. Louis police officer Jason Stockley was found not guilty of murder in the death of drug suspect Anthony Lamar Smith.Critics said a lawmaker should not be advocating for people to stage protests.His decision comes after St. Louis Mayor Lyda Krewson launched an investigation and called for a state audit in January of a city jobs agency amid reports of financial mismanagement.
At the time, television station KMOV reported there were discrepancies in time sheets submitted by Franks, who worked as a youth mentor through the program with reported work hours not matching up with events and locations posted on Franks’ social media pages.Franks said the mentoring job associated with the St. Louis Agency on Training and Employment, or SLATE, was not a typical 9-to-5 office position and included late night phone calls.In August, Franks filed for bankruptcy, saying his sole income is derived from being a state representative: $2,993 a month. He did not report any income from his mentoring position, which he left in February.
Franks said his decision to resign was not motivated by the taint of scandal, but by a desire to show people of color that they can address mental health issues.He said he has been wracked by anxiety and depression brought on by “survivors guilt.” On his desk in the Capitol is a collage of recently deceased family and friends.“In December I hit bottom. I’ve lost a lot of people,” Franks said. “We don’t talk about it. We are elected officials, but we are humans.”

            From Ferguson protester to state legislator, Bruce Franks Jr. says he will never stop fighting





Franks had signaled he wanted to run for Sen. Jamilah Nasheed’s 5th Senate District seat when she is forced out by term limits after the November 2020 election.He didn’t rule out a future run for office, but said he’s relieved to have made a decision to end his service in the House.“I feel like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders,” he said.A special election to fill the post could be scheduled for November by Gov. Mike Parson.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,All eyes will be on the Missouri House Friday for abortion bill vote,"May 17, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/all-eyes-will-be-on-the-missouri-house-friday-for/article_1ea1da4b-d7ee-5f71-a6fa-d96eeabcc1f4.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — Shortly before 4 a.m. Thursday, the Missouri Senate pushed through a tough anti-abortion bill. Republicans declared victory for the unborn.Several hours later, staff at the Planned Parenthood clinic in the Central West End — the only abortion clinic in Missouri — began getting calls. National media had begun to notice.“I’ve been shuffling media around all morning,” said Jesse Lawder, spokesman for Planned Parenthood. “National, international, local — and they’re just showing up. Like I got a call from CBS Evening News this morning. They’re like, we’re at the airport.”

All eyes will be on the Missouri House Friday, where state representatives likely will approve the measure. They face a deadline of 6 p.m., when the legislative session ends.The House passed a version of the bill earlier this year, but because the Senate made changes, the House needs to vote again before sending the measure to Gov. Mike Parson’s desk.One of the most striking changes overnight was offered by Republicans. Under the House legislation, abortions would have been banned if a fetal heartbeat could be detected, which can occur as early as six weeks into a pregnancy.But GOP senators removed the fetal heartbeat language, replacing it with a strict eight-week ban on abortions. That language, they reasoned, may better withstand court challenges.Missouri is joining an effort with other states to tighten restrictions on abortion and give the U.S. Supreme Court a chance to rescind abortion rights.The measure approved by the Missouri Senate would be one of the toughest anti-abortion laws in the nation: It allows abortions in medical emergencies, but makes no exceptions in cases of rape, incest or human trafficking.Lawder, of Planned Parenthood, predicted that if the vast majority of abortions are outlawed in Missouri, patients would head to Illinois where abortion is more accessible.“The mood here is — is, I mean, people here are really concerned about what this means for patients,” he said.Democrats spent most of the day Wednesday filibustering the measure in the Missouri Capitol.And Republicans worked all night to get it passed.By 4 p.m., the Senate recessed and Democrats and GOP Senate leadership met for behind-the-scenes negotiations.At 5:30 p.m., the governor, a Republican, held a campaign-style rally in his office. He invited a crowd of abortion foes. And GOP House members helped fill the room.Parson demanded the Democrats relent, allowing the legislation to come to a vote. Sen. Bob Onder, R-Lake Saint Louis, urged GOP leadership to stop negotiating with the Democrats.Onder is one of the leaders of the so-called Senate Conservative Caucus, a six-member cohort that has acted as a thorn in the side of Parson and President Pro Tem Dave Schatz all legislative session.
“Stop by leadership’s office,” Onder told the crowd. “Tell them: Get this bill to a vote. Don’t dilute it. Don’t gut it. Every piece in this bill is important.”About 5:50 p.m., when asked whether the two sides had a deal, Sen. Gina Walsh, D-Bellefontaine Neighbors, said, “No, we do not”At 7:55 p.m., Onder sent out an “EMERGENCY ACTION ALERT” to supporters.“We can’t let them weaken, dilute or ALTOGETHER GUT the bill, CAN WE?” the email said. He urged supporters to contact Senate Majority Leader Caleb Rowden, R-Columbia, and Schatz “and ask them to bring this bill to the floor NOW, not WEAKENED, NOT DILUTED, NOT ALTOGETHER GUTTED!”At 9:30 p.m., the conservatives held a news conference expressing the same sentiment. Negotiations between Republicans and Democrats continued.
Sometime overnight, Schatz, R-Sullivan, emerged from his office and spotted Bev Ehlen, an anti-abortion activist who had posted online the cellphone numbers of Schatz and Rowden that evening.“Never come to my office,” Schatz angrily told Ehlen as he breezed by, according to the account of a Kansas City Star reporter.“Take it like a man,” Ehlen called out to Schatz.Schatz, according to the report, turned around and got in her face: “That is so amateur for you to put my cell number out there.”Talks continued. Shortly before 12:30 a.m., Sen. Jamilah Nasheed, D-St. Louis, was filmed doing push-ups against a brass water fountain on the third floor of the Capitol. She was waiting.Shortly before 4 a.m., the Senate reconvened, and Republicans pushed the bill through. Democrats won small concessions, they said.After negotiations, Democrats allowed a vote on the bill, and they all voted “no.”To keep filibustering would likely have meant forcing Republicans to resort to a “nuclear” option — moving to call the previous question — which could have triggered a melt down, with Democrats using procedural maneuvers to stall progress on all legislation.Onder expressed displeasure at the concessions, but GOP Senate leadership declared victory.“We all collectively stand as one to protect the unborn,” Rowden said, choking up. “It’s a subject we care deeply about.”The legislation is House Bill 126.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Nathan's Law, designed to crack down on dangerous day cares, headed to Missouri governor","May 17, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/nathan-s-law-designed-to-crack-down-on-dangerous-day/article_6a2faae9-fe17-5d67-bee0-80b67f9ccd81.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — A St. Louis County lawmaker’s proposal to crack down on unlicensed day cares is headed to Gov. Mike Parson’s desk, the result of years of advocacy and a Post-Dispatch investigation that exposed Missouri’s lax regulations of in-home day cares.“Nathan’s Law” was inspired by Nathan Blecha, who died in 2007 after suffocating at an unlicensed day care in Jefferson County. He was 3 months old. His caretaker, Nathan’s mother found, was taking care of 10 children at the time, four of whom were her grandchildren.The Post-Dispatch, as part of its Deadly Day Cares series, published an article about Nathan on Oct. 10, 2011.

Currently, in-home day cares may serve four children, but caretakers may watch an unlimited number of relatives — a loophole that poses risks as caregivers are spread too thin.Nathan’s Law, sponsored by Sen. Jill Schupp, D-Creve Coeur, would limit the total number of children allowed at a home day care to six.The bill would exempt only children living “in the caregiver’s home who are eligible for enrollment in a public kindergarten, elementary, or high school” from being counted toward the six-child limit.Caretakers also would be allowed to care for no more than three children younger than age 2.Anyone who violates Nathan’s Law would be guilty of a Class C misdemeanor and would be subject to a maximum fine of $750.Missouri law now says a person who violates the current limits is guilty of an “infraction” and shall be fined up to $200.
Subsequent offenses under Nathan’s Law carry a $2,000-per-day fine.Subsequent violators would be guilty of a Class A misdemeanor, which carries a maximum one-year prison sentence, the same as penalties under current law.“It has real teeth to encourage prosecutors to prosecute when there are problems,” Schupp said. “It also gives the Department of Social Services the ability to go in and prosecute if the local prosecutor will not.
“And it raises the fines and fees, so it’s really going to discourage people from watching too many kids and putting their lives in danger,” Schupp said. Deadly Day Cares: A special reportSchupp said she had filed Nathan’s Law for 11 years, and credited former Post-Dispatch reporter Nancy Cambria with exposing the problem of unregulated day cares in Missouri.“She worked diligently to get background information, to get stories, to get information from coroners and share that with me over the years,” Schupp said. “And now all of that work, for all of these years, has come to fruition.”Schupp said that Parson, a Republican, had also supported her efforts this year.Nathan’s Law was included in House Bill 397, a wide-reaching proposal dealing with topics related to child welfare.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Up next for Missouri lawmakers: outlawing vast majority of abortions,"May 16, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/up-next-for-missouri-lawmakers-outlawing-vast-majority-of-abortions/article_3a440a53-e931-52d9-82c0-0f295abfa301.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — Inspired by President Donald Trump’s moves to shape a more conservative U.S. Supreme Court, Missouri Republicans raced the clock to join a parade of other states seeking to overturn the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized abortion.Facing a 6 p.m. Friday adjournment deadline and a deep desire by Democrats to block the sweeping legislation, senators worked overnight on a package of changes that would ban the vast majority of abortions in Missouri.Shortly before 4 a.m. Thursday, the GOP-led Senate approved a version of a sweeping abortion bill that the House had approved months earlier. The measure will need another vote in the House before heading to Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican, who is expected to sign the legislation.

""We all collectively stand as one to protect the unborn,"" Senate Majority Leader Caleb Rowden, R-Columbia, said after the vote, which fell along party lines, 24-10. ""It's a subject we care deeply about.""
https://t.co/BCbH3rX3b8— Missouri Senate Republicans (@MoSenateGOP) May 16, 2019
 Although Missouri already is one of the more restrictive states when it comes to access to abortion, the latest push by the Republican-controlled Legislature comes amid a nationwide effort by abortion foes to get anti-abortion laws on the books that could be upheld by the newly revamped high court.At a campaign-style rally in his office, Parson on Wednesday evening urged the Senate to approve the package.“We have the opportunity to be one of the strongest pro-life states in the country,” Parson said. “It’s a God-given right to live. That’s why we’re here today, to protect people who don’t have a voice.”Democrats held court on the Senate floor for much of the day, stopping other work and criticizing the legislation and working to try to ease some of its harsher provisions.“I would characterize this legislation as extreme,” said Sen. Lauren Arthur, D-Kansas City. “I think this legislation will be struck down as unconstitutional.”“This is an unconscionable use of our power as a legislature,” added Sen. Jill Schupp, D-Creve Coeur.Under the House's version, sponsored by Rep. Nick Schroer, R-O’Fallon, and handled in the Senate by Sen. Bob Onder, R-Lake Saint Louis, abortions would be banned if a fetal heartbeat can be detected. It would also make abortion illegal in Missouri if the Supreme Court strikes down Roe v. Wade.Specifically, the measure would require providers to check for a fetal heartbeat before performing abortions or pay a $1,000 fine and face a potential loss or revocation of a physicians’ medical license.The provision is similar to “heartbeat” laws put on the books in Mississippi, Kentucky, Ohio and Georgia that ban abortion once a fetal heartbeat is detected. That can occur in about the sixth week of pregnancy.Kentucky’s six-week ban was challenged after it was signed in March, and a federal judge temporarily blocked it. Similar versions of the law have been struck down in North Dakota and Iowa.If the heartbeat provision is struck down, the bill calls for abortions at the “pain capable gestational age,” or about 20 weeks after fertilization, to be prohibited.The Missouri proposal also includes a requirement that both parents be notified if a minor seeks an abortion. And, Republicans tacked on a provision barring abortions from being performed solely because the fetus has Down syndrome.The measure says an abortion can be performed in “cases of medical emergency,” which is defined as “a condition which, based on reasonable medical judgment, so complicates the medical condition of a pregnant woman as to necessitate the immediate abortion of her pregnancy to avert the death of the pregnant woman or for which a delay will create a serious risk of substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function of the pregnant woman.”House Speaker Elijah Haahr, R-Springfield, told reporters the measure is not designed to draw a court challenge.
Rather, he said, “This is the type of legislation designed to withstand a challenge.”Rep. Mary Elizabeth Coleman, R-Arnold, said abortion was one of the primary reasons she ran for office last year.“We want to make abortion not only illegal, but unthinkable,” Coleman said.Sen. Jamilah Nasheed, D-St. Louis, blasted the Republican reaction to Trump’s attempt to swing the balance of the court to the conservative side.“They are pandering to this goofball,” Nasheed said. “He’s dangerous.”The abortion measure was approved in the House in February on a 117-39 vote.Opponents said abortion laws should be left alone in order to allow women to decide what’s best for their lives.
Schupp outlined several problematic provisions within the measure, but said one was particularly troubling.“There was no exception for a pregnancy caused by rape or incest,” Schupp said.“This is a massive blow to the reproductive rights of women in the state of Missouri. Everyone should be appalled by that,” Nasheed said.St. Louis has the only clinic able to offer abortions in the state. Last year, there were 2,911 abortions performed in Missouri, down from 3,903 in 2017, according to the Department of Health and Senior Services.M’Evie Mead, director of Planned Parenthood Advocates of Missouri, called the legislation an attack on health care.“The state of health care in Missouri is abysmal. Gov. Parson is willfully aiding in the systematic downturn of health outcomes across our state, and banning safe, legal abortion is just the latest effort,” Mead said.But, said Onder, “There is still more work to do.”After hours of closed-door meetings late Wednesday, Senate President Pro Tem Dave Schatz, R-Sullivan, was unwilling to say whether a deal had been struck to move forward with a vote.But, Sen. Bill Eigel, R-Weldon Spring, suggested the Senate could return to action as early as 11:30 p.m. to resume debate, but 11:30 came and went without movement.The Senate eventually convened after 3 a.m. Thursday and had approved the bill within the hour.The legislation is House Bill 126.Jack Suntrup of the Post-Dispatch contributed to this report.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Lawmakers approve plan to shine more light on how Missouri draws its political maps,"May 16, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/lawmakers-approve-plan-to-shine-more-light-on-how-missouri/article_662a4cf1-2c97-5c7d-a5c0-81b5d9d288cb.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — Missourians could get the chance to weigh in on the state’s redistricting process under legislation heading to Gov. Mike Parson’s desk.Voters approved Amendment 1, known as Clean Missouri, in November, which altered how Missouri’s political maps will be drawn.A nonpartisan state demographer will lead the redistricting effort for state legislative seats prior to the November 2022 elections. The end result could be more Democrats serving in the Republican-dominated Legislature.

Legislation by Sen. Dan Hegeman, R-Cosby, and Rep. Curtis Trent, R-Springfield, would require the demographer to create an online portal for public commentary. The provisions do not alter Clean Missouri itself. ""Hopefully it will make the process stronger,"" Trent said.The measure was approved in the House Thursday on a 142-3 vote.
People submitting comments would be required to disclose whether anyone funded their submission, and who cut the check. Auditor Nicole Galloway, the only Democrat holding statewide office, is in charge of the demographer application process. She will submit the names of at least three candidates to the Senate majority and minority leaders.
The state's current system of once-every-decade redistricting involves bipartisan commissions of political appointees who carve up the state's legislative districts.Republicans have sought to weaken a separate part of Clean Missouri that subjects lawmakers to the Sunshine Law. They also have attempted to undo the redistricting changes.But, those efforts have stalled in the waning days of the spring session.The legislation is Senate Bill 213.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Medical pot lobbyist co-hosting high-dollar fundraiser for Gov. Mike Parson next week,"May 16, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/medical-pot-lobbyist-co-hosting-high-dollar-fundraiser-for-gov/article_bc906233-8b0f-5fd3-a7e6-84a4cdfc7b46.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — Steve Tilley, lobbyist for the Missouri Medical Cannabis Trade Association, is co-hosting a high-dollar fundraiser for Gov. Mike Parson next week, according to a copy of an invitation obtained by the Post-Dispatch.Guests are asked to spend between $2,600 and $25,000 at the fundraiser, with money going toward Parson's campaign committee and its sister political action committee, Uniting Missouri, which does not have to adhere to campaign contribution limits imposed after a 2016 ballot initiative.The fundraiser comes as Missouri officials are finalizing rules for the state's fledgling medical marijuana program, which is scheduled to launch next year.

In addition to representing the medical pot trade group, Tilley also  represents Florida-based BiotrackTHC, a marijuana products software company seeking a state contract to help Missouri run the medical marijuana program. The company did not win a potentially lucrative state contract, and its attorney has filed a challenge to the decision with the state that as of last week was unresolved.""We have a very broad cross-section of supporters who contribute,"" said John Hancock, chairman of Uniting Missouri. ""The governor really is not very involved in the fundraising and solicitations at all.""Hancock said the identities of all donors are disclosed.""My job with the PAC is to raise money,"" he said. ""We are raising money and every nickel we raise is disclosed.""Missouri voters legalized medical marijuana in November, starting a stampede of business owners looking to capitalize on the new market.By 2025, sales of the various forms of the product are expected to top $100 million.Under the new law, the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services is required to grant at least 24 dispensary licenses in each of Missouri’s eight congressional districts, for a total of 192.The law also calls for the state to license 60 growers and 86 processing facilities.The complete list of applicants is not known because the state will not release their names. The Post-Dispatch has filed a lawsuit alleging the state is violating the Sunshine Law.Officials have said the text of a constitutional amendment authorizing the program precludes them from doing so, but one of the men who pushed for the amendment has said backers never intended for the names of applicants to be kept secret.Tilley’s involvement in the fundraiser comes after Parson collected at least $15,000 in campaign contributions from a separate consortium involved in the state’s burgeoning medical marijuana business.
The contributions to Parson’s Uniting Missouri PAC came on March 4. They include $5,000 from Blonie Dudney, a St. Louis eye doctor who is heading a newly formed medical marijuana company called Artemis Therapeutics.The other $5,000 contributions are from JoAnn’s Greenhouse, a Perryville retail plant grower and distributor, and Richard Buchheit, the son of the greenhouse owners, where Dudney wants to open his growing facility if he wins a license.Tilley, who is also a former Missouri House speaker, is not the only host of the fundraiser.Others include Sterling Bank of Poplar Bluff, which is involved in the state's low-income housing tax credit program that former Gov. Eric Greitens helped freeze in late 2017.
Greitens' exit led to Parson's elevation to governor from his former post as lieutenant governor.John Bardgett, of John Bardgett & Associates, is also listed as a co-host. That company has had to respond to pay-to-play allegations regarding a contract it won to lobby for the St. Louis Economic Development Partnership.The contract was mentioned in the indictment of former St. Louis County Executive Steve Stenger last month.In a statement, John Bardgett said his firm had worked for 31 years with St. Louis County and its economic development organizations.“This has occurred through the administrations of 5 county executives of different party affiliations — we do not, have not and never will place any conditions on any contribution to any organization,” he said in an email last month regarding the Stenger indictment.Michael Hafner, a former campaign adviser to former Gov. Eric Greitens, who eventually testified against the governor in a campaign finance scandal, is listed as a coordinator for the fundraiser on the invitation.""I haven't been working with Parson or his team up until a month and a half ago or two months ago,"" he said. ""They approached me because they needed help coordinating fundraising.""He said he is a long-time political consultant who has worked for several candidates. Hafner said he is still paying off legal bills stemming from the Greitens scandal.""I've had a role in these high-level races for literally my entire career,"" he said.The fundraiser is scheduled for next Tuesday evening at the Dean Team Automotive Group location in Maplewood, 7700 Manchester Road.

Mike Parson, who voiced support for an earlier version Wednesday.

It includes exceptions for medical emergencies, but not for pregnancies caused by rape or incest. Doctors would face five to 15 years in prison for violating the eight-week cutoff. Women who receive abortions wouldn't be prosecuted.Republican Senate handler Sen. Andrew Koenig described it on Thursday as ""one of the strongest"" abortion bills yet passed in the U.S.Missouri joins a movement of GOP-dominated state legislatures emboldened by the possibility that a more conservative Supreme Court could overturn its landmark ruling legalizing the procedure. Its senators voted only hours after Alabama's governor signed the most stringent abortion ban in the nation on Wednesday, making performing an abortion a felony in nearly all cases.
Outnumbered Missouri Senate Democrats launched into an attack on the bill before Republican supporters had a chance to bring it up for debate on the Senate floor.""So much of this bill is just shaming women into some kind of complacency that says we are vessels of pregnancy rather than understanding that women's lives all hold different stories,"" St. Louis-area Democratic Sen. Jill Schupp said.
Missouri is among a growing number of states where abortion opponents are working with renewed enthusiasm following President Donald Trump's appointment of more conservative high court justices. Kentucky, Mississippi, Ohio and Georgia have approved bans on abortion once fetal cardiac activity can be detected, which can occur in about the sixth week of pregnancy. Similar restrictions in North Dakota and Iowa have been struck down in court.Supporters say the Alabama bill is intentionally designed to conflict with the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion nationally in hopes of sparking a court case that might prompt the justices to revisit abortion rights.Missouri's bill also includes an outright ban on abortions except in cases of medical emergencies. But unlike Alabama's, it would kick in only if Roe v. Wade is overturned."

Stewart currently serves an Associate Circuit Judge in St. Louis County where he lives with his wife and four children. Former Gov. Jay Nixon appointed Stewart to his post in 2016 after the Legislature created the position.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,$50 million incentive package for GM's Wentzville plant wins approval,"May 15, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/million-incentive-package-for-gm-s-wentzville-plant-wins-approval/article_82f3f9b7-ee5a-504d-a67f-f6d7143fa9fa.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — A bloc of Republican senators ended a 27-hour holdout Tuesday, giving Gov. Mike Parson a victory in his bid to deliver a $50 million incentive package to General Motors.After an overnight filibuster and a day of intense, closed-door negotiations, members of the Conservative Caucus pulled the plug on their protest and agreed to allow a vote on what Parson called “a comprehensive economic development strategy for growth across Missouri.”

Senators sent the measure to Parson on a 25-8 vote, saying it sends a message to businesses.“We here in Missouri want to aggressively cultivate and grow our workforce,” said Sen. Lincoln Hough, a Springfield Republican who sponsored the proposal.“Today’s final vote is a complete victory for Missourians and jobs in every corner of the state. We are sending a powerful message to the nation that we are ready to compete with every state for more jobs,” Parson said.The thaw in relations now frees time for the Senate to begin debating other key issues before Friday’s scheduled adjournment. Top on the agenda for Republicans is a sweeping anti-abortion bill expected to be brought to the floor Wednesday.“I would not want to do anything to impede that,” said Sen. Andrew Koenig, R-Manchester.GM wants to invest $1 billion to upgrade its Wentzville plant, which employs about 3,500 workers. Officials say the automaker is being wooed by other states, but the governor has not said which ones.While the plant upgrades would not immediately create new jobs, Parson argues they would ensure production remains in St. Charles County for the long-term. He also said GM has 178 suppliers across Missouri that would benefit from the plant expansion.The facility produces the GMC Canyon, the Chevrolet Colorado and full-size vans.The turnaround under the Capitol dome came after Parson told reporters that he was not backing down in the face of opposition. He argued that the package is not about just helping GM, but will assist people and job growth throughout the state.“I’m not going to leave the rest of the state out,” Parson told reporters during a briefing in his office. “This is about the whole state of Missouri.”Republican Sens. Bob Onder of Lake Saint Louis and Bill Eigel of Weldon Spring, both of whom represent St. Charles County, railed against Parson’s call for what they termed a “slush fund” that could allow as much as $116 million to be spent on business expansion.
Briefing underway on GM deal. ⁦⁦@GovParsonMO⁩ not backing down #moleg pic.twitter.com/INS79ykbOS— KurtEricksonPD (@KurtEricksonPD) May 14, 2019

“Those funds have been plagued with inefficiencies, with mismanagement,” Onder said in an interview. “And with these slush funds, there’s always the allegation of pay-to-play corruption.”
The House attempted to intervene in the spat Monday by passing a slimmed-down version of the package to the Senate.The maneuver failed to sway Parson or Senate President Pro Tem Dave Schatz, who said GM opposes the House version because it contains a provision requiring them to retain 90 percent of the jobs at the plant.Parson said the state traditionally has targeted an 88 percent retention rate, but a final number would be left to negotiations between GM and his administration.“I think you’ll find in the final contract that that’s going to be taken care of,” Parson said.
At 1:16 p.m. Tuesday, two of Parson’s top aides exited Onder’s office. Members of the Conservative Caucus were eating Chipotle. There did not appear to be a breakthrough at that time.When asked if the conservative bloc was seeking to break the 37-hour filibuster record set by Democrats in 2016 over an anti-gay rights bill, Onder said: “Where are we now?”“We started at 2 p.m. yesterday. We’re almost there. We’re almost at 24 hours. Yeah, you never know. You never know in this building,” Onder said.Business groups, who are aligned with Republicans, urged the conservative bloc members to relent in their demands and approve Senate Bill 68.“The Missouri Chamber of Commerce and Industry is asking the Missouri Senate to pass a bold workforce and economic development package that has the potential to make a strong positive impact on our state’s economy. Senate Bill 68 is this year’s best hope to make significant progress toward improving our workforce, helping Missouri compete for jobs and attracting an extraordinary investment to the General Motors facility in Wentzville,” said chamber executive director Dan Mehan.The filibuster had put other priorities in limbo as the Legislature headed toward its 6 p.m. Friday adjournment deadline.One of those is passing legislation imposing additional restrictions on abortion. The other is putting a question on the November 2020 ballot that would undo a new legislative redistricting process that voters approved last year as part of the Clean Missouri proposal.“I think both of those issues are important,” Parson said. “I think those are both things that have to get done.”Onder said the six members could have continued their filibuster, but they worried that they wouldn’t get a chance to vote on the abortion bill.“We could continue to stand until Friday at 6 p.m. We could continue to stand until Thanksgiving. But the clock ticks against us,” Onder said. “Do we move forward to protect innocent human life as we pledged to do when we ran for office or do we oppose some misguided economic policy?”Jack Suntrup of the Post-Dispatch contributed to this report.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri is on the verge of making hearing aids more accessible to poor people,"May 15, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/lifestyles/health-med-fit/missouri-is-on-the-verge-of-making-hearing-aids-more/article_964c6069-8aba-5dee-8bd5-853d0af406b7.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — Missouri lawmakers on Tuesday gave final approval to a proposal that would help people who are deaf or hard of hearing access hearing aids.The bill, sponsored by Rep. Ann Kelley, R-Lamar, creates a hearing aid distribution program that will provide financial assistance for the purpose of buying hearing aids to deaf or hard of hearing people earning less than the federal poverty level.To make less than the federal poverty this year, an individual must earn less than $12,490 per year; a family of four must earn less than $25,750 per year, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

Audiologists will need to perform assessments on patients before they are eligible for the state aide.Legislative budget writers devoted $100,000 to the Statewide Hearing Aid Distribution Fund for next fiscal year, which begins July 1.
The Missouri Commission for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing may accept donations for the fund, and may write regulations for doling out the money.
A nonpartisan fiscal analysis of the plan estimates that 10 percent of Missouri's population is deaf or hard of hearing. The analysis says that people with disabilities are more likely than others to live in poverty.The bill now goes to Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican, for consideration.The legislation is Senate Bill 101."
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Editorial: In-state tuition for Dreamers just makes good business sense,"May 14, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-in-state-tuition-for-dreamers-just-makes-good-business/article_54bc9727-ec01-568f-913e-64155b581f6d.html,"Missouri state legislators couldn’t seem to make up their minds about the educational fate of the young immigrants known as Dreamers. These are the youths brought here illegally by their parents and who, in most cases, know no other country than the United States. Some legislators seem to want to punish them for being undocumented — a status that none of them chose.Missouri is one of just six states that ban in-state benefits to Dreamers, youths who arrived here before 2007 and who qualified for deportation protection under the federal Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. House and Senate conferees took the bold step last Wednesday of removing language from House Bill 3, an appropriations measure for higher education, that would have continued denying them in-state tuition.Wednesday’s move seemed a major sign of progress. But on Thursday, conferees re-inserted the in-state tuition ban.

With all the attention President Donald Trump has focused on illegal immigration, this issue has unfairly become immersed in his anti-immigrant crusade. A lot of people, apparently including some state legislators, think this is about Democrats vs. Republicans or Trump policies vs. those of former President Barack Obama. They couldn’t be more wrong.Republicans in staunchly red states like Texas have come to understand that there’s nothing to be gained by holding one class of young people down while advancing others toward educational success. When Dreamers are denied in-state tuition, many if not most give up on the idea of higher education because it’s too expensive. A future full of menial jobs awaits.
Forcing them into this status runs directly contrary to Gov. Mike Parson’s priority of building Missouri’s workforce preparation to make Missouri more attractive for employers and business investors. He should demand they rethink this provision.
General Motors, which is contemplating a major investment in Wentzville, says the corporation “stands with the Dreamers we employ and the hundreds of thousands of Dreamers employed by multiple companies across the U.S.”In Texas back in 2001, long before Obama was president, then-Gov. Rick Perry led his fellow Republican lawmakers in approving in-state tuition for undocumented students. Perry is no liberal. As governor, he recognized that a well-educated workforce would make the Texas economy hum like a race car, as it does today. It made no sense to deny in-state tuition to that state’s large population of undocumented youths and put Texas at a competitive disadvantage.The Texas Association of Business remains firmly behind in-state tuition. In Arkansas, Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson also backed such a provision for Dreamers. Oklahoma has done likewise. These Republican initiatives are every bit in line with their conservative, pro-business beliefs.Missouri is the outlier. Why? Because politicians are blinded by Trump’s anti-immigrant tirade and refuse to see well-educated Dreamers for what they are — a workforce asset to boost Missouri’s competitiveness."
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Give Dreamers a chance with in-state tuition in Missouri,"May 14, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/columnists/give-dreamers-a-chance-with-in-state-tuition-in-missouri/article_3fa9f0b3-6493-506f-8081-dde38b4379ec.html,"I’m not from Missouri; the citizens of your state should make the laws that are best for you. But I know a few graduates of Missouri high schools who lost a big opportunity last week when the Legislature first adopted and then, a couple of days later, took back in-state tuition for those with Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) status.I think Missouri — as well as the Dreamers — would be better off if you gave them the chance to go to college — not by giving them state money, not scholarships, but in-state tuition. The measure hasn’t been signed by Gov. Mike Parson. I hope he’ll persuade the Legislature to change it.Many U.S. citizens are uneasy about current levels of immigration. They don’t want to offer anything to recent border crossers; they don’t like it when immigrants arrive in the country illegally and then commit crimes; and they don’t approve when immigrants arrive here illegally and then ask for federal benefits.

None of these is the case with DACA recipients. They arrived in the country before June of 2007. They’ve never been convicted of a serious crime; if they are convicted, they lose DACA status. And DACA does not give them access to Pell or federal college grants or to loans of any kind.I help run a national college scholarship program for DACA recipients; 3,700 are in college nationally (including 17 Missouri high school graduates attending college in other states). Our average scholarship recipient came here at the age of 4 with his or her parents. I am very strongly pro-law enforcement. Many years ago, I was a patrolman with the Washington, D.C., police department. I arrested felons and sent them to jail; I didn’t arrest any 4-year-olds.When that 4-year-old grows up, there is no way he or she can become a citizen or green card holder — no line they can stand in, no test they can take, no fee they can pay. No, they can’t join the U.S. military.Why should Missouri’s Legislature give the DACA students in-state tuition?1. It costs you nothing. Neither DACA nor the grant of in-state tuition gives the Dreamer students any federal or state money.2. It appears that your colleges could use the revenue. Missouri’s state colleges are down by 22,000 students since 2013. The Dreamers can attend without depriving any Missouri citizen student of his or her place in the state’s colleges (if any college is full-up in enrollment, give the Dreamers access to all the rest).
3. Some legislators appear to feel that because they are the children of undocumented immigrants, the DACA students shouldn’t have all the benefits of citizens — that they should have a higher hill to climb.Believe me, they do.Almost all their low-income high school classmates receive federal Pell grants (up to $6,195 per year for many years); all, regardless of income, are eligible for federal loans. For the Dreamers: no grants and no loans. In addition, there are state scholarship programs (the Missouri Department of Higher Education website lists nine different ones); the Dreamers aren’t eligible for any. Unlike their low-income classmates, the Dreamers will be paying in-state tuition without help from any of those U.S. or Missouri programs. That’s quite a hill to climb.
Despite these obstacles, the motivation of the Dreamer students is remarkable. Our 17 Missouri students are part of a group that also includes students from Georgia, North Carolina and other states that deny the Dreamers in-state tuition. We started paying for them to attend good low-cost colleges in Tennessee, Connecticut, Delaware and elsewhere three years ago. In the last three years, 415 students enrolled. Five have dropped out — a 98 percent retention rate.One state just came off the list of those denying in-state tuition: Arkansas’ Republican Legislature passed, and Gov. Asa Hutchinson has signed this year, a bill to give Arkansas Dreamers in-state tuition.After decades of running scholarship programs for U.S. citizens in my home town, I joined two friends setting up a program to give modest aid ($8,250 per year maximum) for Dreamers to attend the lowest-cost good colleges in their home states. Why? Because I met some Dreamers. I never met students who want to go to college so desperately, and I never met any who face more obstacles.I know a lot of Missourians. Almost all are kind; certainly none is cruel, and I am sure no legislator wants to be. But when Missouri high school students want so badly to go to college, when your colleges could use the added enrollment, when your employers need more educated people, why not give these students a chance? Just open the door. The Dreamers will do the work.Donald E. Graham is co-founder of Thedream.us and a former publisher of The Washington Post."
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,High court hears challenge to change Clean Water Commission membership,"May 14, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/high-court-hears-challenge-to-change-clean-water-commission-membership/article_d45e556a-dbc2-5653-b114-de56fd2111ea.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • An environmental group called on the Missouri Supreme Court Tuesday to grant them the ability to challenge a 2016 state law that gave farming and mining interests more power over the state’s water quality.In arguments before the high court, the Missouri Coalition For The Environment questioned a lower court ruling that found they didn’t have legal standing to pursue the Legislature’s three-year-old rewrite of the state’s Clean Water Commission.At issue is a law championed by groups like the Missouri Farm Bureau that environmental groups said would allow for a corporate takeover of a commission that has the ability to approve or deny construction permits for facilities that have the potential to damage Missouri waterways.

The coalition believes the law is unconstitutional because it was amended on to legislation dealing with a separate subject. State law requires bill to be limited to a single subject.A circuit court dismissed the case, saying the environmental coalition could not prove they had a legal interest in the case. The court also said the new law did not violate the state’s single subject clause.In arguing in favor of keeping the law intact, the state said even if the coalition had a legal interest in the case, they cannot claim any particular damage has been done by the law at this time.“This does appear to be something that falls outside of review,” said Water Commission Attorney Justin Smith.Judge Paul Wilson, however, questioned whether the Legislature could pass a law that insulates members from their own actions.
Smith didn’t disagree.“It is a very narrow universe of bills,” Smith said.
Supporters said the change in the membership of the Clean Water Commission was needed because members of the public lack the expertise to make good decisions regarding the effects of industry on the state’s waterways.Opponents said the law was written in response to an earlier decision by the committee to deny a permit to a large-scale hog farming operation in Grundy County.Former Gov. Jay Nixon had vetoed the bill, but he was overridden by the Republican-led Legislature.With the law in place, former Gov. Eric Greitens named a trio of new members with strong agricultural ties to the panel in 2017.Gov, Mike Parson has continued that pattern, nominating a farmer to the board last year.The court did not issue a ruling on the matter Tuesday.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Local rules on large farms scrapped by Missouri lawmakers; bill headed to Parson's desk,"May 14, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/local-rules-on-large-farms-scrapped-by-missouri-lawmakers-bill/article_c5f4ebb4-0ea3-5e01-bea6-c685e42c142e.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — The Missouri House on Tuesday sent to Gov. Mike Parson legislation that would ban counties from cracking down on large animal feeding operations through regulations.The legislation, sent to the governor on a 103-44 vote, forbids counties from enacting regulations on concentrated animal feeding operations, or CAFOs, that are more stringent than state standards. Groups such as the pro-industry Missouri Farm Bureau have made the legislation a priority this year.Groups such as the anti-CAFO Missouri Rural Crisis Center support the county regulations, saying state standards are weak compared to the county rules. But industry groups say the regulations are a back-door way of ensuring large farms stay out of a county, impeding economic development.

Senate Democrats launched an overnight filibuster of the proposal last month, and eventually earned concessions in the form of setback requirements for ""export-only"" CAFOs, and the formation of a legislative committee that will study the environmental impacts of agriculture in Missouri.Export-only CAFOs ship manure to other farms, where the manure is used as fertilizer. The legislation imposes regulations on where the manure can be sprayed, with the goal of protecting waterways and public lands, the Democrats said.Sen. Mike Bernskoetter, R-Jefferson City, the bill sponsor, said the proposal would stop the roughly 20 counties that already have health ordinances on the books from enforcing the rules.Parson, a Republican, is expected to sign the bill. He cheered news last month that the proposal advanced out of the Senate.
Rep. Tracy McCreery, D-Olivette, said the implementation of CAFOs throughout Missouri is short-term way of boosting agriculture production, but will be damage the state's landscape in the long run.""My concern is that with this bill’s passage we are going to go from being the clean state of Missouri to a very dirty state very quickly,"" she said on the House floor.While Democrats pushed for local control, Republicans said CAFO regulation should be a state issue.
“Would you support each county making a decision on whether or not to implement right to work?” Rep. Curtis Trent, R-Springfield, asked McCreery.""I think that our state Department of Agriculture and the USDA are more capable of handling these issues than a county court or a health department,"" said Rep. Don Rone, R-Portageville.The legislation is Senate Bill 391.Lexi Churchill of the Post-Dispatch contributed to this report.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Chulick: GM and Gov. Parson want to keep Wentzville plant open. Why play politics?,"May 14, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/columnists/chulick-gm-and-gov-parson-want-to-keep-wentzville-plant/article_e405e5f7-7bc1-5a5a-b5c9-a910cc81018d.html,"In a time of automotive plant closures in Ohio and Michigan, General Motors is actually looking to invest $1 billion in its Wentzville plant, which according to Gov. Mike Parson would be the largest private sector investment in our state — ever. The investment would include expansion of the plant, upgrades to technology and an assurance that GM is here to stay for decades to come.We can imagine the great sigh of relief and excitement from GM’s 3,500 local employees and their families, the city of Wentzville and their schools — not to mention the owners and employees of the 200 supply-chain businesses and nearly 9,000 jobs across Missouri the GM plant currently supports. But as of Thursday, the deal was close to falling through — all because some of our local Missouri legislators would rather filibuster and play politics instead of supporting their own governor’s efforts to keep and grow good-paying jobs in Missouri.Here is the story: Earlier this month, General Motors announced it is considering investing nearly $1 billion in its current Wentzville facility. GM has undergone transformative changes over the past year, shuttering five plants in North America, including in two of our Midwest neighbors, Ohio and Michigan. The closing of these plants hit some 14,000 workers, and yet, Missouri has the opportunity to compete for the expansion of our state’s GM plant in Wentzville that produces GM’s most popular truck lines, the Chevrolet Colorado and GMC Canyon.

The governor recently announced a comprehensive plan to “sharpen Missouri’s economic development tools and grow Missouri’s automotive industry.” The plan includes Parson’s key economic and workforce development initiatives: Fast Track, that would give financial grants to adults over the age of 25 to obtain education and training needed to fill high-demand jobs; One Start, which would provide more workforce training opportunities for new and expanding businesses; and The Deal Closing Fund that would allow the Missouri Department of Economic Development more flexibility when incentivizing businesses to locate to Missouri.Finally, the deal includes an incentive package for automakers like GM. According to Parson’s press release, the incentive package would “help retain automotive jobs by granting $5 million in tax credits annually to automotive manufacturers that invest $500 million or more in plant upgrades and agree to retain current workers.” The plan would also extend an additional five years if an automaker like GM makes an additional $250 million investment in the state.
For what seems like a no-brainer, some in the Missouri Legislature are not convinced the incentive package is what is best for all Missourians. Citing corporate welfare, those who would oppose such a plan clearly do not realize that GM has already invested $2.36 billion in Missouri since 2010 and impacts about 1 million Missouri workers including plant employees, suppliers, transportation service providers, and manufacturers and is now considering investing another $1 billion in the state. Missouri is actually a clear winner in this deal.
Gov. Parson and General Motors have made it clear that they think these economic and workforce development programs and the incentive package will be a benefit to every Missourian and every Missouri business. Giving our citizens the ability to climb into high-demand jobs, providing businesses with more resources to train their employees for the future, and attracting GM and other important corporations that provide thousands of jobs and billions to our state is absolutely essential for our state’s growth.In Wentzville and across Missouri, there are thousands of families who depend on their GM jobs to feed their families, pay their employees, keep their restaurants open and support local schools. We know the devastating impacts these plant closures can have on local communities with issues like unemployment and increased drug addiction. Corporate welfare is a problem in the U.S. It can be abused. But this isn’t the case here — this is a vision to grow between two longtime partners, Missouri and GM. Let’s not create another Chrysler closure. The right call was to put these families and communities first and keep GM open in Missouri.Tom Chulick is president and chief executive officer of the St. Louis Regional Chamber."
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,'Debtors prison' legislation heading to Gov. Mike Parson's desk,"May 14, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/debtors-prison-legislation-heading-to-gov-mike-parson-s-desk/article_633c2cc2-c5bf-5041-adce-09a5938c53c0.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — A proposal to do away with so-called debtors prisons in Missouri is headed to Gov. Mike Parson after the House gave final approval to the measure  Monday.The bill, sponsored by Rep. Bruce DeGroot, R-Chesterfield, was spurred by a series of columns by Post-Dispatch columnist Tony Messenger, who wrote about people across the state who had been locked up multiple times in county jails for minor violations.Counties have charged prisoners what are known as ""board bills"" for their stays in jail, which can total thousands of dollars. If the person does not pay off the board bill, they can be required to attend what are known as monthly ""show-cause"" hearings or risk additional jail time.

The legislation approved Monday allows counties to use civil means to collect jail debt, but counties would no longer be authorized to hang the threat of additional jail time over defendants for failure to pay. The measure would do away with the “show-cause” hearings.House members sent the bill to Parson's desk on a 138-11 vote.In one case Messenger wrote about, George Richey, of Appleton City, Mo., was charged a $3,150 “board bill” in 2015 after his 90-day stay in the St. Clair County jail.He was convicted of a misdemeanor for violating a protective order. When he did not pay the board bill, Richey was re-arrested, and he received an additional $2,275 bill after serving more time in jail.
Richey challenged the second bill. The Missouri Supreme Court in March sided with Richey, pouring cold water on counties' revenue collection system.The court said Richey was responsible for his original jail bill, but the court waived the additional $2,275 charged to Richey after his second stay in jail.Messenger wrote last week that the system was still in effect in some localities, despite the Supreme Court's ruling.
Messenger last month won a Pulitzer Prize for his series of columns.""We are correcting a problem that a lot of people faced in Missouri,"" said Rep. Mark Ellebracht, D-Liberty, during debate on Monday on the House floor.The legislation is House Bill 192.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Abortion, GM subsidies, redistricting: Missouri lawmakers save hot topics for final week","May 13, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/abortion-gm-subsidies-redistricting-missouri-lawmakers-save-hot-topics-for/article_64943702-2515-5608-9b6a-fbc981242ffa.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — Missouri lawmakers are primed to burn the midnight oil as they wrap up their five-month legislative session this week.The Republican-led House and Senate have saved some of the most controversial topics for last: abortion, legislative redistricting and tax subsidies for General Motors.After sending Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican, a dozen bills outlining the state’s budget for next fiscal year last week, lawmakers are now preparing for a marathon that could include more GOP infighting and the likelihood of impassioned Democratic filibusters designed to slow progress on Republican initiatives.

Unlike previous years, said Sen. Jamilah Nasheed, D-St. Louis, Democrats have been aided by open sparring on the Senate floor between a conservative bloc of six senators and GOP leadership. Democrats have been able to sit back and watch the “implosion,” she said.“We as Democrats didn’t really have to do a lot of heavy lifting these last two weeks because these conservative six were fighting with leadership,” Nasheed said. “We just sat back and we just watched the show.”But, in the final week, Nasheed said, she expects Republicans to put aside differences to bring to the Senate floor a strict abortion bill, a controversial redistricting proposal to be put on the ballot, or both.If they do so, she said, Senate Republicans risk effectively ending all other work by sparking Democratic filibusters meant to run out the clock. The Legislature is constitutionally required to adjourn by 6 p.m. Friday.The redistricting proposal Republicans want to put on the ballot would ask voters to scrap a “nonpartisan demographer” who would draw legislative maps after the 2020 census. Voters approved the demographer as part of the “Clean Missouri” ballot initiative last year.GOP backers want a bipartisan panel to draw the maps, which critics argue has led to horse-trading and unfair advantages for Republicans in the past.“If they were strategically planning to undermine the will of the people they would do it the last day,” Nasheed predicted.Abortion, GM expansionThe sweeping anti-abortion proposal is designed to trigger a court challenge that the GOP sees as a way of overturning the landmark Roe v. Wade decision that made abortion legal nationwide.In February, the House forwarded legislation to the Senate requiring a doctor to check for a fetal heartbeat before performing an abortion or face a $1,000 fine and a potential loss or revocation of his or her medical license.It also includes a provision to ban a woman from aborting a fetus that might have Down syndrome, as well as a requirement that both parents be notified before a minor receives an abortion.The package contains no exceptions for pregnancies that are the result of rape or incest.It would ban almost all abortions in the state if the U.S. Supreme Court would vote to overturn Roe v. Wade.Senate Democrats are expected to use their filibuster powers to try to block the measure.Under Senate rules, 18 votes are needed to force a vote on legislation. The parliamentary procedure, however, is used sparingly because it triggers legislative logjams, spurring hourslong speeches by scorned members who don’t have any limits on how long they may speak.In a preliminary debate on the abortion changes last week, Democrats criticized the legislation.“I personally view that abortion should be a woman’s decision, not the government’s,” said Sen. Scott Sifton, D-St. Louis County, adding that he and colleagues were prepared to debate the bill on the floor indefinitely.The two chambers also are being pressured by Parson to approve a $50 million incentive package spread over 10 years for General Motors, which is considering a $1 billion expansion of its truck and van assembly plant in Wentzville.As part of the package, Parson has folded in authorization for his “Fast Track” scholarship program and a “Missouri Works-Deal Closing Fund” designed to help with attracting businesses. Detractors, including Sen. Bill Eigel, R-Weldon Spring, have compared the closing fund to a “slush fund.”“I’m not very interested in expanding corporate welfare programs,” Eigel said Friday, declining to speculate why the governor’s office included two of its top priorities that Eigel opposes in a package designed to draw jobs to Eigel’s county.Eigel said GM has never told him the mechanisms were a major factor in GM’s decision-making process.“I think we’ve been a great partner to GM and if we weren’t then they would never be considering additional investment in the first place,” Eigel said.Differing dynamicsEach year, there are different dynamics that dictate the outcome of a session.In 2018, the closing days unfolded against the backdrop of former Gov. Eric Greitens’ meltdown. At this time last year, a House investigative committee was firing off subpoenas and engaging in an open public relations war with the scandal-plagued governor’s office.Despite the chaos Greitens’ problems created, the Legislature approved scores of bills on a variety of subjects, including legalizing the production of industrial hemp, loosening regulations on hair braiders and raising the age for juveniles to be prosecuted as adults.This year, the House and Senate spent much of the penultimate week squabbling over whether the Senate would move to approve an elusive prescription drug monitoring program.In previous years, one senator, Republican Rob Schaaf of St. Joseph, used the filibuster to block Missouri from joining the rest of the nation with a monitoring program over privacy concerns.
With Schaaf gone because of term limits, the Senate’s so-called Conservative Caucus has filled that void and has said it would not allow the opioid abuse-fighting program to get on the books.In response, the House Rules Committee, chaired by Rep. Holly Rehder, R-Sikeston, has stopped the flow of Conservative Caucus-backed legislation, halting progress on some of the conservatives’ priorities.Eigel said Friday that he realizes Rehder is passionate about passing her drug-monitoring proposal, but he indicated he was willing to let some conservative bills die in committee if it meant letting Rehder’s bill fail.“It’s just not something that I envision happening at this point,” he said of Rehder’s proposal.Budget woesWith revenue up over last year’s level, lawmakers avoided having to make painful cuts to planned state spending for next fiscal year, which begins July 1.After months of committee hearings and hours of floor debate, the most controversial issue became whether public colleges and universities should be able to use state money to grant in-state tuition to students with unlawful immigration status who live here.After a House-Senate conference committee voted to allow schools to do so, House GOP leadership moved to renege, saying taxpayers shouldn’t subsidize tuition for those who came to the country illegally.But the move triggered consternation from Democrats and some Republicans who thought the budget wording was a done deal.“What is happening to this institution is disrespectful,” said House Minority Leader Crystal Quade, D-Springfield, on the House floor on Thursday. “The way that this body operates has been so frustrating.”House Speaker Pro Tem John Wiemann, R-O’Fallon, called the impasse unexpected.
“This week was certainly more contentious than we thought it was going to be,” Wiemann said Friday. “But we dealt with it and got it done like we are supposed to do.”One bill environmental and farming interests are watching is Senate Bill 391, which would forbid counties from imposing on large feeding operations rules that are more stringent than state standards.More than 20 Missouri counties have passed more rigorous regulations, but groups such as the Missouri Farm Bureau argue the ordinances impede the spread of modern farming in what are known as Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations, or CAFOs.Senate Democrats won some concessions, including rules on what are known as “export-only” feeding operations, which ship manure to other farms so those farms can use the manure as fertilizer. The creation of a joint committee to study environmental impacts of agriculture was included in the bill.The House could move fast to approve the proposal in the final days.The House and Senate have a number of other issues pending that could fall by the wayside if abortion and redistricting dominate debate.In a year when lawmakers promised to tackle criminal justice reform, much of the House legislation that would do so still awaits approval in the Senate.On Thursday, the Senate approved a proposal that restricts courts from incarcerating defendants for not paying “board bills” charged to them for previous stays in county jails, along with an initiative that allows judges to depart from minimum sentences in nonviolent cases.The Senate is prepared to add other provisions to a separate minimum sentencing proposal that has been vetted by the House, including drone restrictions around state prisons and the addition of “vehicle hijacking” as a separate crime.Other pending legislation includes an initiative to allow older inmates to seek early parole, a requirement to supply women in state prisons with free tampons and efforts to expunge certain crimes from residents’ records.An effort to stop eminent domain from being used in the construction of the Grain Belt Express wind transmission line appeared to be faltering last week in the Senate even though House Speaker Elijah Haahr, R-Springfield, marketed the bill as one of his priorities.“There could be a lot of bills that could die just because of lack of time,” Wiemann said.An expansion of charter schools into other areas of the state could be one of them.Senate Majority Floor Leader Caleb Rowden, R-Columbia, said last week that charter school legislation remains one of his top priorities.A proposal from Eigel would allow charter schools to open in areas other than Kansas City and St. Louis, while adding oversight and intervention possibilities if the schools do not perform well.The chamber’s conservative caucus has also been pushing for a voucher program that would finance parents’ first choice for their child’s K-12 education while changing the way students are allowed to move from under-performing schools.But, without enough support to advance out of the House, neither item is likely to cross the finish line.“There’s really no way that’s going to get done this year,” Wiemann said.Lexi Churchill of the Post-Dispatch contributed to this report.What to watch for in Missouri Legislature's final week• A sweeping package further limiting abortion in Missouri will be debated in the Senate late in the week. Democrats are expected to mount a vigorous effort to stop the measure from reaching Gov. Mike Parson’s desk. • The Senate will take up a $50 million incentive package to help General Motors finance an expansion of its Wentzville truck and van plant. • Senators are poised to debate a proposed ballot question seeking to change how the state’s political maps are drawn, following changes voters approved last year as part of the Clean Missouri ballot initiative. • A plan to restart the state’s low-income housing tax credit program is on the agenda. The program was canceled by former Gov. Eric Greitens, who said it was benefitting developers and not low-income people in  need of housing. • A long-sought prescription drug monitoring program awaits debate, but a bloc of conservative senators has vowed to block it.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Editorial: Legislators head home this week, leaving LGBT discrimination legal in Missouri.","May 13, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-legislators-head-home-this-week-leaving-lgbt-discrimination-legal/article_7baaa001-3c35-5928-98c6-dd8dca074f26.html,"The Missouri Legislature will adjourn Friday, leaving behind the same serious piece of unfinished business that it has neglected every session since 1998. For the 21st straight year, a common-sense proposal to protect people from discrimination based on sexual orientation didn’t get across the finish line. In fact — as usual — it didn’t even get a floor vote.State law already prohibits discrimination in housing, employment and public accommodations based on list of factors including race, gender, ancestry, disability and age. The time has long since passed when mainstream America would accept things like whites-only restaurants or male-only job openings. But discrimination based on who people love still isn’t prohibited under Missouri law.The annual attempt to change that failed despite promising signs of reception from some leading Republicans, including Gov. Mike Parson. Supporters should begin working — now — to make an anti-discrimination measure a front-and-center issue next year. Get it done.

It’s a sign of progress that current Missouri laws prohibiting racial and other discrimination are hardly controversial anymore. There’s general acceptance today of the premise that skin color, gender, religion and other traits or beliefs shouldn’t be allowed as impediments to employment, housing or, say, being served in a restaurant.Yet sexual orientation, which doesn’t affect anything but the most personal aspects of a person’s life, can still close doors — to apartments, to jobs, to tables. To the right to be treated like any other citizen.
The Missouri Non-Discrimination Act would have changed that, with two bills adding sexual orientation and gender identification to the existing bans on discrimination by landlords, employers and businesses. Sexual orientation shouldn’t be any more controversial than those other protections.
Yet, as reported last week by the Post-Dispatch’s Lexi Churchill, the Missouri House leadership didn’t even give the measure a committee assignment until late April, just a month before Friday’s scheduled adjournment, indicating a clear lack of interest in actually ushering it to a floor vote.It did get a recent legislative hearing, providing a telling look at opponents of such measures. They include members of Westboro Baptist Church, the notorious Kansas-based bigots who disrupt military funerals with “God Hates Fags” signs to protest what they see as insufficient hatred in government policy toward homosexuality. Legislators apparently see insufficient reason to put such twisted protesters in their place.Then there was conservative activist Ron Calzone, who warned legislators that the measure violates the “God-given right to discriminate.” When these are the voices fighting for discrimination, a bill to do the exactly opposite almost argues for itself.Proponents can’t keep letting themselves get pushed to the bottom of the legislative agenda. They need to start lining up support and rallying their forces before the next regular legislative session opens in January. Get this important work done next year."
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,20 hours and counting: Filibuster over GM subsidies brings work in Missouri Senate to a halt,"May 13, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/hours-and-counting-filibuster-over-gm-subsidies-brings-work-in/article_af1107a2-5d26-549f-b76c-3b39fa046873.html,"UPDATES with filibuster hitting 20 hour markJEFFERSON CITY — The final week of the Legislature’s annual session got off to a bumpy start Monday as opponents of giving General Motors state tax dollars to expand in Wentzville used their filibuster powers to delay action in the upper chamber.Sen. Bill Eigel, R-Weldon Spring, used stalling tactics to chew up three hours of valuable debate time as he outlined why he is trying to block a $50 million-plus incentive package being pushed by fellow Republican Gov. Mike Parson.

In particular, Eigel said he’s upset the legislation is being sponsored by Sen. Lincoln Hough, R-Springfield, and not by himself or Sen. Bob Onder, R-Lake Saint Louis, whose district includes the factory and many of its workers.“This is a bill that has a direct impact on my district,” said Eigel, adding that some of his own family members work on the truck and van assembly line.Eigel, who drives a Dodge pickup, also said giving companies subsidies is a “path to tyranny,” because it allows government to pick winners and losers.He eventually handed over the filibuster duties to Sen. Andrew Koenig, R-Manchester, who called parts of Parson’s GM package a “disgrace.”“It is a complete waste of Missouri tax dollars,” Koenig said.Onder took over heading into the sixth hour of the filibuster, which was still going at 9:30 a.m Tuesday.The latest attack by members of the Senate’s Conservative Caucus came after Parson and Republican leaders in the House helped muscle the four-pronged economic development proposal through the House late last Thursday.It includes a $5 million per year, 10-year tax credit program for GM if the automaker invests at least $750 million in the St. Charles County facility, which currently employs about 3,500 workers and supports more than 12,000 employees at 178 suppliers in Missouri.But, with the clock ticking down toward Friday’s 6 p.m. adjournment, the delaying tactics mean less time for debate on GM and other hot button issues, including sweeping anti-abortion legislation and a plan to undo a legislative redistricting plan that voters approved in November.Mayors and other local officials from St. Charles County sat in the gallery to watch as Eigel took over the Senate floor and outlined his opposition to the package and then burned more time by reading speeches by former President Ronald Reagan.Earlier in the day the local officials gathered in the governor’s office to livestream a series of positive testimonials about the project on Facebook.“I want to thank the governor for the leadership and supporting — and making sure that we retain jobs in the Wentzville area, and keeping this plant viable,” Wentzville Mayor Nick Guccione said Monday in the governor’s office. “We do need a trained, skilled workforce because people are retiring.”
The estimated 40 local officials also serve as an unofficial lobbying arm of the governor’s office to pressure the entire Senate to approve the package.“They were in town to receive a boost of encouragement from the governor,” said Parson spokesman Steele Shippy.In addition to the tax credits for GM, the plan contains elements of Parson’s “Fast Track” job training scholarship program for adults, which is funded in the proposed budget at $10 million.It also has two other economic development programs the Republican governor wants, including a “deal closing fund” that could be tapped by his administration to seed job growth without legislative approval.But Eigel and Onder call “Fast Track” unneeded and the deal closing fund a “slush fund.”
“My philosophy has always been one that less government is better,” Eigel said.Eigel said he was greeted by the local officials before Monday’s session began and told them he could support a plan that wouldn’t require the expansion of any state subsidy programs.“There’s already a path that’s been identified,” Eigel said.While action in the Senate was frozen, the House approved a stripped-down version of a tax incentive program as a way to potentially solve the impasse.“This is another option for them,” said Rep. Nick Schroer, R-O’Fallon, who sponsored the alternative proposal.“This is so important when a company is coming to the table saying get your act together, get us something to entice us to come to your state,” Schroer added. “We’re trying to put our money where our mouth is and put something on the table.”The governor’s office, however, said officials are not negotiating any changes to the original plan. And Senate President Dave Schatz, R-Sullivan, said the new version was unacceptable.The legislation does not mention the number of jobs that would be created or retained at the plant, where the Chevrolet Colorado, Chevrolet Express Cargo Van, GMC Canyon pickups and GMC Savana full-size van are built.The legislation is Senate Bill 68.Jack Suntrup and Lexi Churchill of the Post-Dispatch contributed to this report.

Since when is it a conservative viewpoint that it’s okay to use tax dollars to open or expand for-profit businesses? Yes, I know, since the first TIF project. Corporations just got a federal tax cut in 2017. Missouri cannot afford the costs of expanding the GM plant when we have many projects that serve the public and are in need of serious investment.

Gov. Mike Parson, I’d prefer not to pay for the expansion of a for-profit business. Where I come from, that’s called corporate socialism.Kevin McConnell • Berkeley"
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Editorial: Revival of Missouri's low income housing tax credits is urgent, but so is reform.","May 12, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-revival-of-missouri-s-low-income-housing-tax-credits/article_2c8c99b1-42c4-5fc0-a9be-df1afeb3a971.html,"Missouri legislators are moving toward restarting the state’s low-income housing tax credit program, which was justifiably halted under former Gov. Eric Greitens because it was inefficient and wasteful. The tax credit is, in concept, crucial to alleviating the state’s housing crunch for low-income residents.With more than 100,000 Missourians on waiting lists for public housing, pending legislation to restart it is not only justified, but urgent. But just as urgent is that the new version contains safeguards to ensure efficiency and accountability that the old program didn’t have.Missouri used to match the federal low-income tax-credit program dollar for dollar, providing an incentive for developers to build housing for low-income residents. It cost the state around $150 million annually but provided important leverage for the creation of affordable housing.

Unfortunately, developers and others took advantage of the program. A 2014 audit found as little as 42 cents of every tax-credit dollar went toward the construction of housing, with inefficiency and assorted middlemen siphoning off much of the rest.Here as around the country, developers enjoying those credits have used cheap building materials, sited low-income housing in already-struggling areas to save on land costs and taken other shortcuts that help perpetuate slum conditions of so much low-income housing.
Still, when Greitens and his allies on the Missouri Housing Development Commission halted the state tax-credit program in late 2017, they left the job only half finished. As we’ve said before, the solution to an important program that is being abused is to end the abuse, not to end the program.
There are promising indications the Legislature, Gov. Mike Parson and others understand that restarting the program, while crucial, has to be done with reforms built in. As state Treasurer Scott Fitzpatrick told a committee last month, a central goal must be to “make it so that we’re getting more than about half the money we’re issuing out the door in credits back in housing.”Among reform ideas is to give the housing development commission broader power to regulate the program. One version of the legislation would create a new scoring method to evaluate projects on a case-by-case basis. It would also allow developers to transfer credits between projects in certain circumstances, which could increase efficiency.The latest version would issue state tax credits at just 72.5 percent of the federal level, instead of the dollar-for-dollar match of the previous program. That would be a move in the wrong direction. There’s still time to restore 100 percent of that funding, and low-income housing advocates should be pressing for that.But the most immediate issue is to reform the program, no matter what level it’s funded at. The need is as pressing as ever, which only makes the necessity of doing it right this time more important than ever."
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Powerful are intentionally denying Medicaid coverage,"May 11, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/mailbag/powerful-are-intentionally-denying-medicaid-coverage/article_6f007367-b4dd-5c37-a211-4ad9c9efd2b5.html,"Regarding “Revelations cast doubt on Missouri’s claim that ‘improved economy’ shrunk Medicaid rolls” (April 26):Medicaid in Missouri has always been notoriously hard to access due to the program’s severely low eligibility limit, but now, even people who already qualify are losing the coverage they deserve. Since 2018, thousands have lost their Medicaid coverage, and Gov. Mike Parson’s administration is doing nothing about it.

This is suspiciously convenient for legislators who believe the program should be smaller, but potentially fatal for a growing number of Missourians who rely on it for care. While Parson and others in his administration have touted the sharp decline in Medicaid enrollees as proof of an upturn in the economy, it is beginning to look like coverage is being intentionally denied due to the unwillingness of people in power to address the real issues.
For example, if someone has reported their income to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (food stamps), it is required that states use that data to determine who is eligible for Medicaid. The Department of Human Services is ignoring that — in violation of federal law. I personally have spent hours in a social services office asserting my own food stamp eligibility, and I know how burdensome the enrollment process is, even without these additional unnecessary hurdles.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri Republicans reverse move to grant in-state tuition to students with unlawful immigration status,"May 10, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-republicans-reverse-move-to-grant-in-state-tuition-to/article_cb6f23b1-6d74-5a9b-808a-28847d6e63d0.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — The Missouri House on Thursday doused a move that would have allowed students without lawful immigration status to receive in-state tuition rates.The vote came as House and Senate members were parsing the latest draft of the state higher education budget.On Tuesday, a House-Senate conference committee stripped four-year-old budget language that forbids state-funded colleges and universities from using state money to offer in-state tuition to the students in question, who are Missouri residents despite their unlawful status.

But House GOP leadership criticized that plan, and on the House floor Thursday, members voted against the new wording, an unusual move that triggered behind-the-scenes negotiations throughout the day.The Senate agreed shortly before 6 p.m. Thursday to renegotiate the higher education bill and delete the lenient language. That cleared the way for the two chambers to approve a dozen less controversial budget bills that fund everything from K-12 education to transportation to Medicaid.The two chambers then spent the rest of the night giving those budget bills final approval.The ill-fated proposal on in-state tuition came from Sen. Jason Holsman, D-Kansas City. In the conference committee Tuesday, he had offered what he called a compromise — allowing state money for in-state tuition but still banning state scholarships for the students — as the panel was debating funding for higher education.That language was ultimately embedded in the budget after two Senate Republicans sided with the committee’s four Democrats.House Budget Chairman Cody Smith, R-Carthage, opposed the new language.He said colleges are only able to charge in-state tuition because of the state’s financial support. Because of this, he suggested taxpayers would in effect be condoning illegal behavior if the students in question were given in-state tuition.He said nothing would stop state schools from raising private money to help the students attend school.
The affected students “live here,” Holsman said Tuesday. “And they’ve grown up here.”He said the students are leaving the state and are taking their tuition dollars with them. Holsman said colleges would be free to choose whether they charge undocumented students living here in-state tuition, similar to policies in place before 2015.According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, as of January 2019, six states had policies restricting in-state tuition from students with unlawful status: Alabama, Arizona, Georgia, Indiana, Missouri and South Carolina.
Missouri is currently seeking to lure a $1 billion investment from General Motors at its Wentzville plant.During heated debate on the House floor Tuesday, Democrats referenced a report by GM stating the company “stands with the Dreamers we employ.”So-called Dreamers — immigrants brought to the United States illegally as children — won protections from the Obama administration through the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program, but some Republicans have long sought to undo those protections.There were 3,524 DACA recipients living in Missouri as of 2017, according to an analysis of federal government data by Governing.Democrats wondered why GM would want to invest in a state that doesn’t accommodate so-called Dreamers. GM did not respond to an inquiry asking whether the company factors in a state’s immigration policies when deciding whether to invest in a state.The drama over immigrants overshadowed other budget actions, including the House’s support for another bill that funds K-12 education. That bill fully satisfies the state’s funding formula, boosting spending by more than $60 million over this year’s levels. The new fiscal year starts July 1.School transportation costs will also see a $5 million increase in state support.“Overall, with the money we have … HB 2 is a good bill,” said Rep. Kip Kendrick, D-Columbia.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri House gives green light to incentives for Wentzville GM plant,"May 9, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-house-gives-green-light-to-incentives-for-wentzville-gm/article_c1e8de2d-f550-598c-ac40-fc1f465c8d7e.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — Moving in rapid-fire fashion Thursday, the Missouri House approved a package of incentives worth more than $50 million to help General Motors expand its plant in Wentzville.Just a week after the Post-Dispatch first reported the automaker’s expansion plan at the facility 40 miles west of St. Louis, the GOP-controlled House voted 92-51 to approve a four-piece economic development proposal that includes a $5 million per year, 10-year tax credit program for GM.The money will be paid out if the automaker invests at least $750 million in the St. Charles County facility, which  currently employs about 3,500 workers and supports more than 12,000 employees at 178 suppliers in Missouri.

The push for state assistance comes as GM has shuttered five plants in North America and laid off more than 14,000 salaried and hourly workers as part of a restructuring.“We do not want, or need, to be next,” said Rep. Nick Schroer, R-O’Fallon.Among those who voted ""no"" were a handful of members from St. Charles County, including Rep. Bryan Spencer, R-Wentzville, whose district includes the plant.He was skeptical of the need for subsidies, saying he believes Gov. Mike Parson is pushing too hard and moving too fast for the incentives. ""Haste makes waste and there's a lot of waste here,"" Spencer said. ""It's too much.""""This is not capitalism. This is crony capitalism,"" added freshman Rep. Tony Lovasco, R-O'Fallon. Others were concerned about the long-term stability of a company that is closing plants and laying off thousands of workers.""There's no guarantee that GM will be around in five years,"" said Rep. Jason Chipman, R-Steelville.With a week to go in the Legislature’s annual session, the measure now heads to the Senate, where it faces an uncertain future.The two senators who represent St. Charles County, Republicans Bob Onder of Lake Saint Louis and Bill Eigel of Weldon Spring, have suggested they may want to pare down the package sought by Parson.
In addition to the tax credits for GM, the plan also contains elements of Parson’s “Fast Track” job training scholarship program for adults, which is funded in the proposed budget at $10 million.It also has two other economic development programs the Republican governor wants, including a “deal closing fund” that could be tapped by his administration without legislative approval to lure companies to the state.Eigel, in an earlier email to colleagues, called the program a “slush fund” that he and his colleagues should block.The legislation does not mention any number of new jobs that would be created at the plant where the Chevrolet Colorado, Chevrolet Express Cargo Van, GMC Canyon pickup trucks, and GMC Savana full-size van are built. The facility has been in operation since 1983.But, a handout from the governor’s office notes that the program is aimed at job retention and job retraining.
“The package of legislation proposed by Governor Parson sharpens Missouri’s economic tools, helping us compete for the General Motors expansion in Wentzville and in future job creation projects across the state,” the four-page flyer said.A statement from Parson said, “We are now one step closer to passing one of the most comprehensive workforce and economic development proposals that proves to the country that Missouri is open for business.""""This isn't only going to help GM,"" said Rep. Ron Hicks, R-Dardenne Prairie, who said he was initially skeptical of the Fast Track program but now believes it contains safeguards that will help move people into jobs.House Minority Leader Crystal Quade, D-Springfield, failed in a bid to add language to the legislation that would require the company to pay back state money if there are job losses at the factory.""All we're asking is they maintain the jobs that are here,"" Quade said.In addition to keeping jobs at the factory and the suppliers, Schroer said the expansion could trigger bridge and road construction projects in the area.""This is going to prompt a lot of good construction jobs,"" Schroer said.The legislation is Senate Bill 68.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Editorial: Missouri's new marijuana industry is already seeding state politics with cash.,"May 9, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-missouri-s-new-marijuana-industry-is-already-seeding-state/article_1bc494f4-8672-5142-bf22-fd12cdd80e1b.html,"Missouri’s nascent medical marijuana industry is getting right down to business, and we don’t mean growing plants. Industry players have already donated more than $15,000 to a political action committee controlled by Gov. Mike Parson, whose administration will decide who gets growing licenses and what regulations they’ll face.There’s no law against giving money to politicians as they’re making decisions that directly affect the donor’s business — but, as the Steve Stenger saga in St. Louis County has so freshly reminded us, there should be. The Parson donations also drive home how problematic it is that the state is trying to hide the identities of marijuana license applicants.Missourians in November voted to legalize medical marijuana. With sales expected to top $100 million by 2025, competition is fierce to get licensed by the state for a piece of that action.

It was within that context that the owner of the newly formed medical marijuana company Artemis Therapeutics, and a Perryville greenhouse that Artemis plans to work with, gave $15,000 Parson’s Uniting Missouri PAC. As the Post-Dispatch’s Kurt Erickson reported this week, it came in the form of three $5,000 donations, all on March 4.There’s no proof the donors or Parson have done anything wrong. Of course, the same could have been said, for years, of Stenger, the former St. Louis County executive whose donors were continually getting official favors while giving him money. It took federal investigators to prove those circumstances weren’t just suspicious, but criminal.
Even absent a crime, the act of giving money to politicians who can influence who gets those marijuana licenses and what regulations will apply to them creates an appearance of such impropriety that it diminishes public trust in government.
One solution would be a ban on any political donations from people seeking or receiving marijuana licensing. Or, Parson and other officials could simply declare publicly that they won’t accept such donations. After all, Parson pledged in November that he would uphold the “highest ethical standards.”Instead, they’re just making those donations difficult to identify. The Post-Dispatch is suing the state to force release of the identities of marijuana license applicants, because the state has taken the bizarre stance that protecting those applicants’ proprietary information means even their identities can be hidden from the public.The fact that Parson’s PAC is taking money from prospective marijuana licensees wouldn’t have come to light at all if not for Erickson’s investigative reporting, which began with a tip. Who knows how many other potential licensees are loading up Missouri’s leaders with cash, hoping to steer state policy to their benefit instead of the public’s?By accepting such conflicted donations — and then trying to prevent the public from even knowing about them — Parson’s administration is casting a shadow of suspicion over this already-controversial new industry. There’s still time to set a better course."
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,The emissions test you love to hate in St. Louis could be going away,"May 9, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/the-emissions-test-you-love-to-hate-in-st-louis/article_e64ae501-d1f4-5131-bb9a-112362216525.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — A test that St. Louis area motorists love to hate could soon go by the wayside.Under legislation backed by the leader of the Missouri Senate, vehicle emissions testing could be dropped in the region next year.Senate President Dave Schatz, R-Sullivan, inserted an amendment into legislation Wednesday that would terminate the tests, which have been taking place for decades in the city of St. Louis, and St. Louis, St. Charles, Jefferson and Franklin counties.

He told his colleagues the state can end the program because air quality has improved. And, he said, newer cars emit less pollution.“It is no longer needed,” Schatz said.Because of high ozone levels, the St. Louis region is the only area in Missouri where emissions testing is required when motorists go to renew their license plates. Automobiles are the largest source of the chemicals that form ozone, but factories, utilities, the petroleum industry and industrial solvents also contribute.Ozone is a respiratory irritant that can cause health problems, especially for children, the elderly and people with heart and lung diseases.The Missouri Department of Natural Resources monitors ozone across the state during the ozone season, which begins March 1 and ends October 31. Sunlight and warm temperatures expedite the process, so ozone usually is a greater problem during the late spring, summer and early fall.But air quality in the St. Louis region improved from an average of 30.3 days of poor air quality a year in the baseline time period of 2009-2011 to an average of 14.0 days per year in 2016-2018, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.Sen. Andrew Koenig, R-Manchester, said some people cannot afford to comply with the tests or buy newer cars that meet the standards.“It’s a tax on poor people,” Koenig said. “If you’ve got a brand new car, you’re going to pass an emissions test.”Others in the Senate raised questions about ending the program, saying it could result in a spike in pollution levels.
“I think we’re moving, from my perspective, in the wrong direction here,” said Sen. Jill Schupp, D-Creve Coeur.Environmental groups also raised alarms.“This is a sneak attack on clean air. These programs are vital to reducing smog pollution in St. Louis. Getting rid of this program will hurt people with asthma, children, the elderly,” said Andy Knott, campaign representative for the Sierra Club.The Republican-led Legislature has endorsed a number of initiatives in recent years that opponents say will roll back environmental protections, including easing regulations for handling toxic coal ash waste, barring local governments from having tougher rules for large-scale animal feeding operations and altering the make-up of the commission that oversees clean water.
A separate piece of legislation awaiting action in the Senate would eliminate vehicle safety testing. However, its prospects remain unclear with just eight days left in the legislative session.Currently, 30 states and Washingtonrequire emissions tests in at least some areas, while 17 states require regular safety inspections. Thirteen states require no inspections.Sen. Doug Libla, R-Poplar Bluff, said he is concerned that removing the emissions testing could jeopardize federal funding.“I am not sure this is the time to be getting this done,” Libla said.In addition to potentially losing federal dollars, a fiscal analysis shows the state would lose $2.8 million in license fee receipts it collects to pay for the program.If approved, the change would go into effect Jan. 1. In addition to needing a final vote in the full Senate, the measure needs approval in the full House and to be signed by Gov. Mike Parson.The legislation is House Bill 499.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"General Motors, weighing expansion in Missouri, 'stands with the Dreamers.' Do Missouri lawmakers?","May 8, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/general-motors-weighing-expansion-in-missouri-stands-with-the-dreamers/article_4c8d4d25-6ee2-5d47-943d-98203f06a88d.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — General Motors “stands with the Dreamers we employ,” according to a copy of a company Diversity & Inclusion Report obtained by the Post-Dispatch.The report is being circulated among Capitol denizens, who want the automaker to invest $1 billion at its Wentzville plant, and its circulation comes as lawmakers debate whether state-funded colleges and universities can charge undocumented immigrants living here in-state tuition.So-called Dreamers — undocumented immigrants brought to the United States illegally as children — won protections from the Obama administration, but some Republicans have long sought to undo those protections.

For the last four years, Missouri has barred state funding for schools that charge in-state tuition to undocumented immigrants living here. On Tuesday, lawmakers moved to strike the restrictive language.But after a House-Senate budget committee approved the new language, legislative insiders said Wednesday that Republican leadership may reverse the committee’s decision.
“GM stands with the Dreamers we employ and the hundreds of thousands of Dreamers employed by multiple companies across the U.S.,” says the company’s report, which appeared to be published either this year or last.
The diversity report also notes that GM has “a strong antidiscrimination policy that protects LGBTQ employees.”In Missouri, sexual orientation and gender identity are not protected statuses, meaning it is legal to discriminate against LGBT people. Lawmakers are considering changing this, but an effort to do so could fizzle as the Legislature approaches its deadline May 17.Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican, has proposed a package of state subsidies and incentives in hope of drawing new money to the Wentzville plant, which already employs about 3,500 workers.In his dealings with the company, at least publicly, Parson has not mentioned the possibility of state accommodations for undocumented workers or LGBT people.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Parson surveys St. Louis area flooding, as waters recede but another crest looms","May 8, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/parson-surveys-st-louis-area-flooding-as-waters-recede-but/article_f9625890-8a06-5aa6-bb82-1009478d5b55.html,"O’FALLON, Mo. — Gov. Mike Parson was in — and above — the St. Louis area Wednesday, surveying flood damage along the region’s swollen rivers from a U.S. Army helicopter.“We’re here to try to assist you,” said Parson, addressing local officials and members of the media at the St. Charles County Emergency Operations Center in O’Fallon, Mo., following his flight.His aerial survey of the area left from St. Louis Lambert International Airport and initially went south toward River Des Peres before circling north to St. Charles County, where floodplains near the confluence of the Mississippi and Missouri rivers are inundated, and where some levees have succumbed to high water in recent days.

Parson said quantifying estimates of flood-related property damage or evacuations was “an ongoing issue” for state and local agencies.Major flooding has been a persistent problem across Missouri in recent years, including this spring. When asked whether river basins need to be returned to a more “natural” state of management compared to their current confinement by widespread levee systems — which various experts blame for pushing floodwater higher — Parson said the state is open to wide-scale discussions about flooding, but did not elaborate on what ensuing changes or actions may include.“We want a seat at the table about how these rivers are changing,” he said.During his stop in St. Charles County, Parson was briefed on the local flood outlook and response by members of the National Weather Service, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and other agencies.
NWS experts said that the area may benefit from relatively dry conditions over the next week — providing a merciful break as river basins mount a “secondary crest” from the latest surge of rainfall to hit St. Louis and regions upstream.
Kevin Deitsch, a warning coordination meteorologist for the NWS’ St. Louis forecast office, warned that weather conditions over the next month — and perhaps beyond — are “critical,” since precipitation at this stage of the year “tends to be heavy rain.” Such a burst could push rivers back toward dangerous heights.“I don’t want us to let our guard down,” he said.Photos from spring flooding in the region

Mississippi River flooding in Alton












A car drives through Mississippi River flood water in downtown Alton on Monday, May 6, 2019. Flood water from the Mississippi River closed streets in downtown, forced the closure the Argosy Casino and flooded the basements of several businesses. The Mississippi River is expected to crest at 34.8 feet later on Monday, almost 14 feet above flood stage. In the flood of 1993 the Mississippi River crested at 42.72 feet. The red painted line beneath the American flag on the grain silos denotes the height of flood water in 1993. Photo by David Carson, dcarson@post-dispatch.com

Mississippi River flooding in Elsah












Alley Ringhausen examines the wall he and other volunteers built around the Riverview House in Elsah, Ill. as floodwater from the Mississippi River seeps through a makeshift barrier on Monday, May 6, 2019. Floodwater from the Mississippi River closed the Great River Road that leads to the town and threatens several houses in the historic village. The Mississippi River is expected to crest just upriver in Grafton at 32.1 later on Monday or early Tuesday. During the flood of 1993, the Mississippi River crested at an all-time high of 38.17 feet. Depending on how high the water gets this will be the third or fourth highest crest for the river in Grafton. ""It's kind of like a chess game really,"" said Ringhausen about fighting the floodwater. Ringhausen, the Executive Director of Great Rivers Land Trust, and other staffers and volunteers placed more than 9 tons of sandbags around the property to try and hold back the river.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri lawmakers consider protections for LGBT people for the 21st year,"May 8, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-lawmakers-consider-protections-for-lgbt-people-for-the-st/article_9452422d-0786-56f3-b050-39cb49cd84b9.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • For more than two decades, lawmakers have proposed adding protections for sexual orientation to the state's anti-discrimination statutes. This year marks the 21st time lawmakers have taken up the proposal.But with a little more than a week left in this year's legislative session, the window to approve the Missouri Non-discrimination Act, or MONA, grows smaller by the day.State law currently prohibits discrimination in housing, employment and places of public accommodation based on race, color, religion, national origin, ancestry, sex, disability and age.

MONA, sponsored by Rep. Greg Razer, D-Kansas City, and Rep. Tom Hannegan, R-St. Charles, would add sexual orientation and gender identity to that list.“We should have the freedom to earn a living without being judged for who we love and who we are as long as we are capable of doing the work,” said Samati Niyomchai, public policy manager for PROMO, a Missouri LGBT rights group. “We should not be denied housing, a fundamental basic human need, because we are gay or transgender.”But opponents worry creating a new protected class will result in more lawsuits.Ray McCarty, president of Associated Industries of Missouri, which represents hundreds of companies, said he encourages businesses to have inclusive policies, but he opposes adding a new class to state statute.“There are people who use their protected status to bring lawsuits that may or may not otherwise go forward and that’s something that we’re concerned with, with establishing any new protected class,” McCarty said.Several members of religious organizations, including the Missouri Catholic Conference, spoke against the proposal, saying it may infringe on others'  religious freedoms.Razer said the bill includes exemptions for religious organizations as long as the organizations don't accept state money.
Kansas City and St. Louis Chamber of Commerce representatives, along with representatives with AARP and Monsanto, said the legislation is good for the state and its economy.Both proposals were filed in December, around the same time Gov. Mike Parson told the Kansas City Star he was open to backing the legislation, which he had voted for years before as a state senator.House Speaker Elijah Haahr, R-Springfield, did not refer MONA to the House General Laws Committee until April 17, with a month left before the end of session.Since all bills must be referred to committee, referring them late in session is a common tactic for legislative leaders who don't want to see a bill become law.
Some bills are referred on the last day, or soon before, meaning they rarely receive a hearing. Other bills referred late are given what are known as ""courtesy hearings.""""I do think that the conversation on MONA is a good one for the Legislature to have,"" Haahr said last week. ""I think that's what the committee process is for, to work through the issue and to figure out if there's a path forward for it.""Razer told the Post-Dispatch that if the chambers can push through a proposal to lure investment from GM within the last two weeks, lawmakers could also approve MONA.“The leadership has made it a priority,” Razer said, referring to the GM bill. “We’re going to get it done. We can do the same for MONA.”Jack Suntrup of the Post-Dispatch contributed to this report.The legislation is House Bills 208 and 350.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Editorial: Gov. Parson tries to evade Sunshine Law compliance by invoking First Amendment,"May 8, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-gov-parson-tries-to-evade-sunshine-law-compliance-by/article_ca5b43aa-85a8-5b1e-a1e7-c63bd2596436.html,"Gov. Mike Parson is trying a novel approach to evade compliance with Missouri’s Sunshine Law, concocting a First Amendment exception that allows his office to redact information about the people trying to influence him or seek his help. State Auditor Nicole Galloway, whose job includes monitoring Sunshine Law compliance, is understandably perturbed. The general public should be as well.The controversy arose over numerous attempts by journalists to review Parson’s records and determine whether special interests are seeking favor or trying to influence him. The assertion of a constitutional right to redact information under the First Amendment, if upheld, could render the entire Sunshine Law moot. The public’s ability to hold public officeholders accountable would be shattered.On Tuesday, Galloway asked Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt for an opinion on whether information may lawfully be redacted related to individuals conducting business with, lobbying or trying to influence government officials. Galloway is a Democrat; Parson and Schmitt are Republicans.

“Government should not be in the business of finding ways to hide information from taxpayers, but time and again, we have seen continued efforts to do just that ...,” she said in a statement. “There should be no confusion on how the Sunshine Law is applied.”Innovative efforts to evade Sunshine Law compliance are the stuff of legends in Jefferson City. Parson’s predecessor, Eric Greitens, and some senior staffers used a phone app designed to automatically delete text messages after being read by the recipient. The app opened new ways for public officials to unlawfully use their government offices to discuss, say, campaign donations, or coordinate official activities with dark-money groups without any record of the communications being searchable under the Sunshine Law.The state Legislature has long exempted itself from the Sunshine Law and is advancing a bill to weaken the law and circumvent new requirements under the “Clean Missouri” amendment approved statewide by voters in November. An exemption blocking constituent emails from discovery would extend even to local governments and school boards.
The problem is that “constituents” could also include lobbyists, developers, contractors or others seeking to influence officials free from public scrutiny.Parson’s communications director, Steele Shippy, says the First Amendment applies because constituents communicating with the governor might fear having their personal information exposed. Thus, it could have an inhibiting effect on their free speech.
Permitting the redaction of phone numbers from official records blocks journalists’ and the general public’s ability to link phone numbers of lobbyists and other special interests with the officials they’re trying to influence.In November, Parson pledged to “lead by example” and abide by the “highest ethical standards.” He committed himself to “provide transparency and uphold the rule of law.”That’s some example.If Schmitt sides with the governor, a gigantic cone of darkness and silence would descend on Missourians’ right to know."
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Industrial farms good for business, bad for neighbors","May 8, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/mailbag/industrial-farms-good-for-business-bad-for-neighbors/article_41d119a6-db8e-5363-ae7f-360ecbf1f65f.html,"Something smells about the recently passed Missouri Senate Bill 391. The bill will soon move to the House: “Overnight filibuster in Missouri Senate ends in win for ag groups that want to lure big farms” (May 1).The legislation means that local environmental regulations of 20 Missouri counties would revert to the already inadequate state standards. Water pollution from liquefied manure and its resulting odor would be rampant. Tough luck if you live anywhere near these gigantic operations.

Whereas Gov. Mike Parson touts this as a win for Missouri farm and ranch families, what it really means is that large, out-of-state operations can move in to take advantage of this weak legislation.
Poisoning land and water is both wrongheaded and unsustainable. Missouri is already one of the nation’s largest cattle- and hog-slaughter states. The lobbyists from the Missouri Cattlemen’s and Missouri Pork Associations will effectively ensure that the Republican-dominated House and Senate continue to expand animal agriculture at the expense of both our human and nonhuman residents unless we let our legislators know this bill is totally unacceptable.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri's beleaguered public defenders poised to earn a small win in this year's budget,"May 8, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/missouri-s-beleaguered-public-defenders-poised-to-earn-a-small/article_e2fcebc1-5695-581a-8ce5-b8efb8363238.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — The Missouri public defender’s office will be able to re-open its juvenile advocacy units in St. Louis County and Jackson County if funding for the endeavor isn’t zapped in the coming days and months.The $913,786 appropriation for the two units represents a small victory for the office, a long-underfunded agency that represents indigent defendants across the state.The units will be able to hire attorneys who specialize in juvenile issues.

“For the kids, they don’t have any public defenders who are experienced in juvenile law,” said Rep. Ingrid Burnett, D-Kansas City, who had advocated for the funding.A House-Senate conference committee approved the spending Tuesday, but the line-item still must clear the full House and Senate later this week.














        
            Missouri children are waiving their right to legal counsel. That's a problem, some lawmakers say.

""Children, and particularly children who get into trouble, don't exercise good judgment,"" said Rep. Ingrid Burnett. ""And so, expecting them to exercise good judgment when it comes to waiving their rights I think is a stretch.""

Mike Parson, a Republican, also could veto the spending, like he did last year, when he nixed $487,000 that was supposed to go toward juvenile advocacy.“This funding will provide a hopeful future for young people involved in the juvenile system and will also reduce the stress on our prison system,” Michael Barrett, the director of the public defender’s office, said in an email. “I seriously hope the Governor shares the legislature’s support for reducing the prison population and protecting the rights of poor children.”Core funding for the public defender’s office will probably remain constant, at about $50 million for the fiscal year that starts July 1. That means the office will still be underfunded by about $30 million, the office has said.
The inadequate funding ultimately leads to more juveniles and adults being incarcerated rather than returning to their communities, Barrett has said. He argues this increases costs to the state in the long run.“Each unit will pay for itself,” Barrett said of the juvenile units. “Each unit will only have to divert 26 children away from state prison in order to generate enough savings to pay for one of these units. The units will serve hundreds of children annually around the state.”The public defender’s office is also poised to receive an extra $500,000 to help address its case backlog.
“The $500,000 is to hire private attorneys to help reduce the current wait-list of individuals charged with an offense who don’t yet have counsel (because of excessive caseloads),” Barrett said. “This is causing people to sit in jail longer, driving up costs for the counties and the state.”While the office has remained underfunded, legislative leaders and Parson have moved forward with several criminal justice reform initiatives this year.The office in the past has tried to raise the profile of its funding issues.In 2016, Barrett ordered then-Gov. Jay Nixon, an attorney, to represent an indigent client amid budget woes within the agency. A judge ultimately said Nixon, a Democrat, did not have to do so.The legislation is House Bill 12.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"In pursuit of an expansion of GM's Wentzville plant, Missouri offering up $50 million in subsidies","May 8, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/in-pursuit-of-an-expansion-of-gm-s-wentzville-plant/article_82b769ca-2c4b-5419-ad55-ac8efe2bbd8c.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — Missouri lawmakers and Gov. Mike Parson are poised to offer a package of tax incentives worth more than $50 million to General Motors in hopes of spurring the automaker to invest at least $750 million in its Wentzville truck and van assembly plant.Less than a week after the Post-Dispatch first reported the expansion plan at the facility 40 miles west of St. Louis, pieces of the proposal began surfacing as an amendment to legislation pending in the House.The package, which will need legislative approval, calls for GM to receive tax credits if it makes at least $500 million in improvements to the plant within three years. The state tax credits would be worth $25 million.

If the company makes an additional $250 million in improvements to the plant, it could qualify for another $25 million.The plan also contains elements of Parson’s “Fast Track” job training scholarship program for adults, which is funded in the proposed budget at $10 million.Parson, who is expected to make a formal announcement about the package on Wednesday, also wants lawmakers to approve other elements of his economic development plan, which could include providing matching funds to help local governments improve roads, bridges and other infrastructure in the St. Charles County community.The proposal is steeped in urgency, not only because the Legislature is set to adjourn on May 17, but because Missouri is competing with other, unnamed states for the expansion, officials said.In addition, Fast Track is one piece of Parson’s economic development agenda that has floundered in the General Assembly. The governor, a Republican, had initially sought to earmark $22 million for the program.The House and Senate have agreed on a $10 million funding level.The legislation does not mention any number of new jobs that would be created at the plant where the Chevrolet Colorado, Chevrolet Express Cargo Van, GMC Canyon pickup trucks, and GMC Savana full-size van are built.
In all, the plant currently employs about 3,500 workers.GM said no decision has been made pending the outcome of the legislative action.“There are several factors that go into making these decisions, including the overall business case for a project, discussions with state and local community officials and discussions with the UAW,” said company spokesman Darri’n Hardy. “GM leadership is awaiting outcomes on these three elements of the business case before making any final decisions regarding potential investment.”State officials contend that a similar package of incentives approved in 2014 led to larger-than-expected investments in the expansion of the Ford Motor Company plant near Kansas City.
According to the Missouri Department of Economic Development, passage of the Manufacturing Jobs Act was based on Ford projecting they would invest $300 million in the Claycomo facility.But, the company exceeded that projection and ultimately invested $473 million and retained 3,850 jobs at the facility — at an average wage of $84,030, said DED spokeswoman Maggie Kost.“Since then, that plant has continued to grow, and we know from subsequent work with them, that they’ve since created more than 3,000 new jobs and are projected to invest an additional $100 million,” Kost said. “So we’ve seen from past experience that job retention and plant upgrades can set the company up for significant job creation down the road.”The proposed package is different, however, in that it doesn’t award tax credits for creating jobs. Rather, it rewards the company for upgrading the facility.It remained unclear Tuesday whether the legislation would be heard first in the House or the Senate.Jack Suntrup of the Post-Dispatch contributed to this report.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Expect the rivers to rise again — soon,"May 7, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/expect-the-rivers-to-rise-again-soon/article_a8fb4ce0-ad4f-55ea-975f-6af206e06c51.html,"ST. LOUIS — Major rivers in the St. Louis area are receding — temporarily, at least.But even as water levels fall, concerns remain. That’s because with significant rainfall expected over the next couple days in St. Louis and regions upstream, another major crest is projected about a week from now.That crest is expected to be about a foot lower than the one that just passed, which, if confirmed, ranks as the seventh-highest in St. Louis’ recorded history. Data from the U.S. Geological Survey said the Mississippi River topped 41.3 feet downtown Monday — more than 11 feet above flood stage.

The slightly lower crest that’s on its way may not pose a greater threat overall, but it could prove especially problematic in areas where flood protection has already faltered. Thirteen area levees have been overtopped by the spring’s extended flooding, with 11 happening in recent days, according to the St. Louis District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. All of the structures are agricultural levees, and some were breached by floodwater after being overtaken.The St. Louis District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers continues to operate its Emergency Operations Center and provide local officials with supplies and technical assistance amid the flood fight.“We’ll continue to have our folks in the field,” said John Osterhage, the district’s chief of emergency management. “We’re still staying engaged.”And although the coming floodwater may not creep as high, continued flooding can still take its toll, particularly on earthen levees. Even if the structures do not breach or become overtopped, water can still find ways to seep through or beneath them.
“There is some risk, the longer that we see elevated river levels,” Osterhage said, “the more saturated levees become and the more likely we are to see seepage issues.”Some area residents in low-lying areas have been evacuated from their homes, but Osterhage did not know how many.Starting Tuesday night, weather forecasts called for flash flooding and some heavy rain to move into upstream regions including Kansas City and parts of Iowa. Wet conditions are expected to move east through Wednesday across central Missouri, where “thunderstorms will be capable of producing heavy rain over already saturated ground,” according to the St. Louis forecast office of the National Weather Service.
Missouri Gov. Mike Parson is scheduled to receive a briefing on area flooding on Wednesday at the St. Charles Emergency Operations Center in O'Fallon.The Mississippi River around St. Louis has been at flood stage since March, and it is not clear when it will return to normal levels. If the latest crest is made official, four of the city’s nine highest floods will have occurred in the last six years — joining events from 2013, 2016 and 2017.Various experts account for the increasingly common floods by pointing to factors such as more extreme precipitation fueled by climate change, and the constriction of rivers by expansive levee systems that push water higher, instead of allowing it to spread out.

Mississippi River flooding in Alton












A car drives through Mississippi River flood water in downtown Alton on Monday, May 6, 2019. Flood water from the Mississippi River closed streets in downtown, forced the closure the Argosy Casino and flooded the basements of several businesses. The Mississippi River is expected to crest at 34.8 feet later on Monday, almost 14 feet above flood stage. In the flood of 1993 the Mississippi River crested at 42.72 feet. The red painted line beneath the American flag on the grain silos denotes the height of flood water in 1993. Photo by David Carson, dcarson@post-dispatch.com

Mississippi River flooding in Elsah












Alley Ringhausen examines the wall he and other volunteers built around the Riverview House in Elsah, Ill. as floodwater from the Mississippi River seeps through a makeshift barrier on Monday, May 6, 2019. Floodwater from the Mississippi River closed the Great River Road that leads to the town and threatens several houses in the historic village. The Mississippi River is expected to crest just upriver in Grafton at 32.1 later on Monday or early Tuesday. During the flood of 1993, the Mississippi River crested at an all-time high of 38.17 feet. Depending on how high the water gets this will be the third or fourth highest crest for the river in Grafton. ""It's kind of like a chess game really,"" said Ringhausen about fighting the floodwater. Ringhausen, the Executive Director of Great Rivers Land Trust, and other staffers and volunteers placed more than 9 tons of sandbags around the property to try and hold back the river.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Undocumented immigrants poised to again receive in-state tuition in Missouri,"May 7, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/undocumented-immigrants-poised-to-again-receive-in-state-tuition-in/article_08d2c3c3-1afa-54b9-9b84-f23f2f527fe5.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — Four years after the Legislature directed public colleges and universities to charge undocumented immigrants’ out-of-state or international tuition rates, lawmakers reversed course Tuesday.Lawmakers agreed to allow state-funded schools to charge undocumented immigrants living in Missouri in-state tuition. But the schools will still not be allowed to award scholarships to the students.The move came as a Missouri House and Senate conference committee parsed the state’s $30 billion budget to settle differences between the two chambers before the chambers send the plan to Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican. The new fiscal year starts July 1.

The Senate had stripped the restrictive language, but the House had kept the in-state tuition and scholarship bans in its version of the budget.Sen. Jason Holsman, D-Kansas City, offered what he called “compromise” language — allowing in-state tuition but still banning scholarships for the students — as the conference committee was debating funding for higher education.The affected students “live here,” Holsman said. “And they’ve grown up here.”He said the students are leaving the state and are taking their tuition dollars with them. Holsman said colleges will be free to choose whether they charge undocumented students living here in-state tuition, similar to policies in place before 2015.














        
            Missouri bans college aid to undocumented students

Colleges have been instructed to strip undocumented students of scholarships and in-state tuition. 




House Budget Chairman Cody Smith, R-Carthage, said colleges are only able to charge in-state tuition currently because of the state’s financial support.Because of this, he suggested taxpayers would in effect be condoning illegal behavior if undocumented students were given in-state tuition as well.Holsman, before the hearing, lined up support from some GOP colleagues, who joined with Democrats to put the new language in place.“There isn’t a good reason” for the state’s current policy “other than something based in fear,” said said Rep. Ingrid Burnett, D-Kansas City.The move represented a victory for Democrats, who had long opposed the in-state tuition restrictions for undocumented immigrants, a group that includes so-called DACA recipients.The two chambers also agreed on an infrastructure funding plan backed by the Senate: The state would issue $301 million worth of bonds, paying the loans back over seven years.
The two chambers budgeted $50 million in general revenue for bridge repairs and another $50 million for a cost-share program so that the state can match funds localities put up for road repairs.The committee also zapped half of the money Sen. Bill Eigel, R-Weldon Spring, had asked for to dig a channel between Bangert Island and mainland St. Charles. Only $1 million is currently appropriated for the project.














        
            St. Charles wants state taxpayers to pay $2 million to re-create an island on the Missouri River

Not everyone is happy about the state support for the St. Charles project, which the city engineer says he envisions as something like the San Antonio River Walk. 




The committee moved to boost school transportation funding by $5 million, down from the $10 million boost the Senate had recommended.
Lawmakers also agreed to budget $5 million for rural broadband grants, up from $2.5 million the House had budgeted.Despite opposition from Democrats, the conference committee also kept strict anti-abortion language in the budget, prohibiting funds from being sent to any “abortion facility or any affiliate or associate thereof.”Sen. Jamilah Nasheed, D-St. Louis, was able to broker an agreement to keep new spending in the budget to care for victims of sexual assault.The Senate had budgeted $500,000 in new spending, but the House had included no new spending for the endeavor. The committee ultimately agreed to spend $250,000.“This is for housing for these people,” said Rep. Deb Lavender, D-Kirkwood.The budget also includes record spending for K-12 education and small increases to college and university core funding.Medicaid spending continues to grow and will account for about $11 billion in spending next year.The plan assumes a 2 percent increase in revenue collections over this fiscal year. This year’s budget assumes a 1.7 percent growth in revenue over last fiscal year.As of Monday, the state had collected $159 million more this year than at the same point last year, a 1.98 percent increase.The budget still must receive approval in the full House and Senate before heading to Parson’s desk.

Mike Parson has collected at least $15,000 in campaign contributions from a group seeking to open a medical marijuana growing facility.Although there is nothing illegal about the contributions, they came at a time when the Republican governor’s administration is in the midst of writing rules and regulations that will govern the fledgling industry, raising questions about whether the donations were designed to influence the process or the awarding of licenses for the cultivation, distribution and sale of medical pot.A spokesman for the Uniting Missouri PAC told the Post-Dispatch he has no problem with the contributions.

“As a rule, we’re pleased to take the support of everyone. We’ve raised money from a vast cross-section of Missourians,” said John Hancock, former executive of the Missouri Republican Party. “I don’t find it troublesome.”The contributions to Parson’s Uniting Missouri PAC came on March 4. They include $5,000 from Blonie Dudney, a St. Louis eye doctor who is heading a newly formed medical marijuana company called Artemis Therapeutics.The other $5,000 contributions are from JoAnn’s Greenhouse, a Perryville retail plant grower and distributor, and Richard Buchheit, the son of the greenhouse owners.Dudney said he began scoping out potential locations more than a year ago, before one of his partners, Jason Buchheit, alerted him to his aunt and uncle’s commercial greenhouse in Perryville.“They were interested in at least trying to explore the opportunity to cultivate medical cannabis,” Dudney said. “My interest is in the science of it. That fits my background very well.”He said the investor group comprises five St. Louis-area physicians who are interested in using cannabis to treat illnesses.They also are partnering with Mid-America Capital, an investment firm run by Jim and John Muller, who have experience in cultivation and retail operations in Nevada and California.Missouri voters legalized medical marijuana in November, starting a stampede of business owners looking to capitalize on the new market.By 2025, sales of the various forms of the product are expected to top $100 million.Under the new law, the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services is required to grant at least 24 dispensary licenses in each of Missouri’s eight congressional districts, for a total of 192.
The law also calls for the state to license 60 growers and 86 processing facilities.The other applicants are not known because the state will not release their names. The Post-Dispatch has filed a lawsuit alleging the state is violating the Sunshine Law.Businesses have been able to pre-file their applications and pay their fees since earlier this year, but Dudney said he is waiting until the actual application period opens in August.“Honestly, we’re using that money for attorney’s fees, blueprints, retrofits that need to be done. We’re trying to save all the money we can,” said Dudney. He is the son-in-law of St. Louis defense attorney Scott Rosenblum, who has represented a range of high profile clients, including former St. Louis County Executive Steve Stenger and former Gov. Eric Greitens.Dudney said the greenhouse currently is growing flowers and other commercial plants and has no marijuana growing at this time.
The state has put safeguards in place designed to reduce the possibility of politics playing a role in the selection of growers.For example, the rules call for names and other identifying information to be separated from an application during the scoring period.Final scoring to determine which companies have won the licenses is scheduled by the end of 2019. If there is a tie in the scoring, the winner would be picked by a lottery system.Dudney did not address why he and others associated with the start-up had contributed money to the PAC.Hancock said the contributions likely came after the host of a fundraiser in Cape Girardeau invited the group to the event.“Typically we do events all around the state. I’m not particularly familiar with these folks,” Hancock said.Uniting Missouri was formed soon after Parson was sworn in as governor on June 1. The former lieutenant governor was elevated to the post after Greitens resigned.In its most recent report, the account had collected more than $2.3 million as of April 1.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Cards notebook: C. Martinez starts comeback with 6-pitch inning at Low-A Peoria,"May 6, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/sports/baseball/professional/cards-notebook-c-martinez-starts-comeback-with--pitch-inning/article_85fad2dd-e22a-5610-960a-541ad4bde188.html,"CHICAGO — Cardinals pitcher Carlos Martinez needed six pitches to get three groundouts in one perfect inning for Low-A Peoria on Sunday as the righthander began his rehab assignment.Martinez’s team assignment will be determined game by game as he makes his way back from shoulder trouble, but the plan for the Cardinals is to use him in relief.He won’t start games to assure he appears — readying instead for the routine he’ll have as he speeds toward joining the Cardinals as a reliever.




The target Sunday was to get him one inning of work and to have him start an inning with the bases empty.The tasks will shift based on how recovers, and the goal for the Cardinals is to see Martinez throw at full intensity, appearance to appearance.“Got to come out of that bullpen, man,” Cardinals manager Mike Shildt said. “Warm up. Get going.”TAKING A BETTER LEADWith four stolen bases by four different players Saturday at Wrigley Field, the Cardinals ran into the National League lead with 23 steals this season. They are a month ahead of last year’s pace, and last year’s leader, Harrison Bader, doesn’t have his first steal of 2019 yet.Kolten Wong has already matched his 2018 total of six, and six Cardinals have at least two steals though the team had none Sunday in its 13-5 loss to the Cubs.
For years, the Cards have started spring talking about being more aggressive on the bases only to slow or stumble as summer arrived. This spring, they worked on a new description: assertive.“Baserunning is probably the least sexiest part of the game in general,” Shildt said. “But it’s also where you win a lot of games. Outside of hitting a home run, you have to run the bases to score, every single time. And you’re either creating opportunities or you’re eliminating opportunities. Eliminating opportunities if you don’t go first to third when you should, don’t tag up when you should, read the ball in the dirt like you should. There is a lot to it. This is a group that is sincere about putting the time and effort into it.”EXTRA BASES
• As the Blues completed their victory Sunday in Dallas, the organist at Wrigley Field began, on cue, playing “When the Saints Go Marching In” as a nod during the Cardinals’ batting practice. . . .• The Cardinals are 57-56 all-time on ESPN broadcasts of ""Sunday Night Baseball."" The Cubs or Cardinals will appear in all four ESPN Sunday telecasts this month. …• Undrafted free agent Tommy Parsons was promoted to High-A Palm Beach after an unerring start to his season for Peoria. Parsons, 23, was 4-0 with a 0.26 ERA in 35 innings for the Cardinals’ lowest full-season affiliate. He had 26 strikeouts and only five walks.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri moving closer to restarting low-income housing tax credit program,"May 6, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-moving-closer-to-restarting-low-income-housing-tax-credit/article_1c965460-296a-581a-91c3-4e28c28ae211.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — Missouri lawmakers could be poised to send Gov. Mike Parson a plan to restart the state’s low-income housing tax credit program.At a time when an estimated 100,000 people are on waiting lists for low-income housing, the legislation would bring back a tax credit program that was put on hold by former Gov. Eric Greitens.The proposal would place a cap on the amount of credits issued at 72.5 percent of the federal level — or about $123 million for the coming year. Previously, the tax credits had been distributed on a dollar-for-dollar match with federal funds.

The latest version, which is awaiting action in the House, also would create a new scoring method to evaluate the merits of various projects and allow developers to transfer credits between projects in certain circumstances.An initial version of the legislation showed it could save $600 million over the next decade.Treasurer Scott Fitzpatrick, who is a member of the Missouri Housing Development Commission, which administers the credits, expressed support for the proposal.“I am pleased to see the House General Laws committee continuing the good work started by the Senate to reform Missouri’s LIHTC program. As I’ve said for more than a year, this program is in need of reforms which will strengthen it, improve efficiency and transparency, and ensure that Missourians’ tax dollars are being used wisely,” Fitzpatrick said.Under Greitens, the commission froze the program, citing years of criticism about the tax credits being inefficient and too favorable to developers.
A 2014 audit of the program said only 42 cents of every tax credit dollar was going toward the construction of housing.Parson has urged the Legislature to reform the oft-criticized program and sent his top aides to the Senate to help push the legislation across the finish line.
The Senate’s version placed a cap on the amount of credits that could be awarded. But Fitzpatrick and others called for placing additional restrictions on the program before it starts up again.Those changes were tacked on Wednesday, winning support from the 40-member Conservative Caucus in the House.“The changes adopted by the General Laws Committee are meaningful reforms that ensure this program operates in an efficient, transparent, and accountable way that provides more housing for those in need at a lower price for taxpayers,” said Rep. Jered Taylor, R-Nixa, who is co-chairman of the caucus.Rep. Justin Hill, R-Lake Saint Louis, who also is a co-chairman, said he was encouraged by the bipartisan support of the changes.“It is our duty to keep a watchful eye on the taxpayer’s dollar to ensure programs such as low income housing serve as a hand up to Missourians when they need it most,” Hill said.The legislation is Senate Bill 28.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"With GM asking for subsidies to expand plant, Missouri governor pressing lawmakers to act fast","May 2, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/business/local/with-gm-asking-for-subsidies-to-expand-plant-missouri-governor/article_00205266-f001-50f3-8b9b-1e5ee056f443.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • General Motors officials outlined a plan to state and local leaders Thursday to spend $1 billion on its truck and van plant in Wentzville, adding hundreds of thousands of square feet and an unspecified number of new jobs.In a closed-door meeting in Gov. Mike Parson’s office, the leaders learned Missouri is competing against other states for the expansion project, which was first reported by the Post-Dispatch Wednesday.“I’m excited that Missouri has a seat at the table to compete for a tremendous opportunity that will provide a boost to our state and to our regional economy,” Parson told reporters afterward.

GM offered no additional details about the talks after saying Wednesday the company appreciates the willingness of the state to work with the company on unspecified “opportunities.”Sen. Bob Onder, R-Lake Saint Louis, whose district includes the plant, said the project would not only retain the existing 3,500 jobs, but add positions, potentially through direct GM jobs and secondary suppliers.“I think it’s going to be both,” Onder said.Although officials are revealing scant details, the package is expected to be a combination of infrastructure spending, tax incentives and subsidies and will need approval from the Legislature, Parson said.It remains unclear exactly what the company is seeking and how much it could cost taxpayers.“We’ve just got to figure out what those numbers are,” Parson said. “We have not completed any negotiations. Many of the details we are not able to disclose. And, we are competing against other states.”The proposal was unveiled as the Legislature heads into the final two weeks of its annual session, adding heightened urgency for lawmakers to focus on approving a number of incentive programs and job training initiatives before heading home for the summer.“There are a lot of details they need to iron out and they’ve only got two weeks,” said St. Peters Mayor Len Pagano, who attended the briefing.Parson and others said they believe a package could come together in the short time span, without requiring a special session.“I think there is plenty of time to get that done,” Parson said.House Speaker Elijah Haahr, R-Springfield, said lawmakers and the governor's office would work over the weekend to fine-tune an incentive package for the company.""I think we will have a very clear idea of what the cost will be by next week,"" he said.
Sen. Bill Eigel, R-Weldon Spring, said state and company officials discussed Parson's Fast Track scholarship program as one item that could help draw in the investment.The $22 million proposal has become a flash point this legislative session, with Eigel, Onder and other members of a conservative bloc blocking the program's passage.Eigel said after the meeting it was too early to say whether he and allies would continue blocking the scholarships, which would be available for students 25 and older with no college degree.""The opportunity to have a $1 billion investment in St. Charles is really a — it's an almost unprecedented opportunity,"" Eigel said. ""And so I am very much interested in seeing what can be done to make that happen for the St. Louis region.""Eigel, Onder, Sen. Andrew Koenig and others had held up the program's passage Tuesday night because Senate leadership would not allow the group to add an amendment that would create what are known as Education Savings Accounts. That proposal would more easily allow families to send their children to private schools, which critics fear would harm the public school system.
Eigel said he didn't know whether he and others would give up the push for ESAs and allow Fast Track or other incentives to pass.""I don't know that this has to be a zero-sum game where I have to make those commitments in order to do something and take advantage of something that's this unique,"" he said. ""When you have something like this on the table, you have to try to make it happen. So I don't know what that means in terms of giving up stuff.""Onder also sounded a potentially positive note.“Overall, the impact is going to be huge and very favorable to our state and to our region,” Onder said. “We’re all committed to doing what we can to really build on the very productive partnership that we’ve had with General Motors.”The Wentzville plant, which opened in 1983, covers more than 3.4 million square feet. Workers build the mid-size Chevrolet Colorado and GMC Canyon pickups and GM’s full-size vans.The automaker added a third shift on the van production line in October to meet strong demand for the vehicles.The scramble to piece together an incentive package to bring jobs to the state is not new.In 2017, former Gov. Eric Greitens called lawmakers into a special session to approve legislation designed to bring a steel mill to the state’s Bootheel region. The proposed factory did not materialize.In 2014, lawmakers and then-Gov. Jay Nixon struck a deal with Boeing Co. obligating the state to hand Boeing $229 million over 18 years if the aerospace giant grows its current St. Louis-area workforce by 2,000 jobs.The deal also allows Boeing to pocket millions in state tax money if it just maintains the jobs it already has here.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,General Motors in talks with state over expansion at Wentzville plant,"May 2, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/general-motors-in-talks-with-state-over-expansion-at-wentzville/article_1b55dfc0-ec26-5ce9-bdf0-934699ee1526.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — General Motors officials are expected to meet with Missouri Gov. Mike Parson on Thursday to discuss a $1 billion expansion project at the company’s Wentzville assembly plant.Although details of the expansion were not immediately available, GM is expected to request a package of incentives from the state to help pay for job training and retooling at the light truck and van manufacturing facility, situated about 40 miles from St. Louis in St. Charles County.Those incentives have already been the subject of sometimes heated political wrangling on the Senate floor, where two St. Charles County lawmakers have questioned programs backed by Parson aimed at job creation.

One of those lawmakers, Sen. Bill Eigel, R-Weldon Spring, said he was pleased to hear GM was considering making a major investment in the region.But he said he was still waiting for details.“It’s hard for me to comment because I’m still not sure what they need,” Eigel said.Sen. Bob Onder, R-Lake Saint Louis, said he would welcome an expansion at the plant but was skeptical about the need for additional incentive programs.“If GM wants to invest another billion dollars in the plant in my district, I am thrilled to hear that,” Onder said. “But I really didn’t hear anything today that would require new legislation or new programs above and beyond what we have.”The Post-Dispatch learned about the meeting between the governor and GM officials in the Capitol, after a series of briefings Parson held with key lawmakers Wednesday.House Speaker Elijah Haahr, R-Springfield, declined to comment, but Rep. Phil Christofanelli, R-St. Peters, expressed hope a deal could be worked out.“I’m still learning about what the negotiations are. I just got a very top-level briefing in the interest in expanding that operation there,” said Christofanelli. “But that would sure be great for the state of Missouri and St. Charles County, and hopefully there is a way to get it done.”Rep. Ron Hicks, R-Dardenne Prairie, would not comment, saying he had been asked not to reveal what was discussed in the meeting.
A spokeswoman for the automaker offered no details on Thursday’s talks.“GM regularly meets with communities and officials to discuss mutual priorities. Although we have no announcements or information to share at this time, we appreciate the willingness of state officials in Missouri to work with us on potential opportunities within the state,” the spokeswoman, Kim Carpenter, said.GM, which employs more than 3,500 workers at the facility, has operated at the site since 1983. It has a payroll of about $236 million with a median wage of $81,000.Since taking over June 1, Parson, a Republican, has been pushing a two-pronged agenda that includes infrastructure improvement and workforce development. GM’s interest in incentives could become a pressure point in negotiations over the Parson’s proposed $22 million scholarship program for 16,000 Missouri adults seeking jobs in high-demand trades.
Eigel and five other members of a conservative bloc in the Senate have held up passage of the so-called “Fast Track” program in hopes of winning concessions on other pieces of legislation, such as charter school expansion.“I think a lot of us are opposed to Fast Track. I see it as an ill-conceived bill,” Onder said. “The whole idea is fatally flawed.”While the governor wants $22 million, the Senate has allocated $10 million for the program. The House has earmarked $18.5 million.The money would be included in the $30 billion budget proposal Parson announced Jan. 16.The conservative caucus also has put the brakes on legislation that would give Missouri Department of Economic Development officials the ability to provide financial assistance to companies seeking to move to Missouri or expand within the state.In a memo to his colleagues, Eigel called those programs “slush funds.”Parson says the top priority for most businesses in picking a location is the quality of the workforce. Parson believes companies may be bypassing Missouri because of a shortage of trained workers.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Selling 4,200 acres of state-owned real estate in the Ozarks could actually cost Missouri money","May 2, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/selling-acres-of-state-owned-real-estate-in-the-ozarks/article_3601d88b-2d41-5d10-8951-4be4e74f1990.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — A plan by Republicans to sell a state park purchased under former Democratic Gov. Jay Nixon could cost the state thousands of dollars in appraisal, auction and legal fees, according to a nonpartisan analysis of the plan by state budget officials.The Committee on Legislative Research Oversight Division also said money the state fetches at auction would need to be returned to an account administered by the Department of Natural Resources, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the U.S. Forest Service, meaning the potentially millions of dollars in sales proceeds would not enter the state’s general coffers.Almost $11 million in settlement money with lead mining companies funded the purchase of 4,200 acres of Oregon County land in 2016, creating Eleven Point State Park, despite outcry from local officials.

The Post-Dispatch reported then that money also covered the purchase of about 1,100 acres near Johnson’s Shut-Ins State Park and several smaller parcels totaling 200 acres, as well as funding for native plant and stream restoration.Nixon and proponents say mined land will never be returned to its original state, so the settlement allowed the government to protect a comparable amount of unaffected land in perpetuity.But opponents have long said Nixon’s land acquisitions were “shrouded in secrecy” and that the DNR does not have the resources to take care of the 88 parks and historic sites it already operates. Opponents of the Oregon County purchase continue to challenge the legality of its purchase in court.The Missouri House has advanced two bills to the Senate that would require the state to auction off the property. The legislative session ends on May 17.The nonpartisan analysis of the plan says the bills require the state to give the previous owner of the land the right of first refusal to purchase the property, for no less than 80 percent of fair market value.If the previous owner doesn’t want the land, the state would be required to auction off the property.And, the Department of Natural Resources told state budget officials that they expected to return any proceeds to the joint account controlled by the state and the feds.“[P]ursuant to financial agreements with the U.S. Department of Interior (“DOI”), any proceeds from the sale of the properties must be returned to the DOI Restoration Account,” the analysis said.
An updated appraisal could cost the state approximately $7,000, the analysis said, which would come from the state parks earnings fund.The analysis says that since the property’s deed requires “the property to remain dedicated to public use as a state park,” that legal challenges could await any planned sale.The analysis also says that the state could also be on the hook for auction fees — approximately 10 percent of the sale price — but that the cost “would likely be passed on to the buyer.”
Parks boosters have assailed the attempt to sell the park, and the Department of Natural Resources itself declined to discuss selling the park following public backlash against the idea.Rep. Robert Ross, R-Yukon, said where the sales proceeds go would likely be determined by litigation. The question of whether the state could legally sell the land would also likely end up in the courts, he said.“This will be litigated,” said Ross, a critic of the purchase. When the state bought the land, “that became an asset of the state of Missouri and now if the state of Missouri decides to sell that, that does not guarantee that that money has to go back to the ASARCO (lead mining) settlement.”Missouri State Parks has not opened the park, saying it doesn’t have the resources to do so. But boosters say plans call for minimal development that would keep construction costs low.DNR is worried about the costs of maintaining the parks, leading parks officials to float joint operating agreements between the Department of Conservation or private groups.Three other planned parks — the land near Johnson’s Shut-Ins, Bryant Creek State Park in Douglas County and Ozark Mountain State Park in Taney County — also await development as Republican Gov. Mike Parson’s administration assesses Nixon’s acquisitions.The legislation is House Bill 1237.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,St. Charles wants state taxpayers to pay $2 million to re-create an island on the Missouri River,"May 1, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/state-and-regional/st-charles-wants-state-taxpayers-to-pay-million-to-re/article_eee8a1fd-dd1d-5e90-901c-f410b1a04671.html,"ST. CHARLES • Rising from the muck of the Missouri River is Bangert Island, which isn’t much of an island anymore. Over the years, a silted-in slough replaced a channel that divided the island from mainland St. Charles.With the help of Missouri taxpayers, officials want that to change.Included in the state’s $30 billion budget for next fiscal year is a $2 million appropriation to kick-start the digging of a side channel between St. Charles and the island. Officials want to use the dug-up dirt to elevate the land surrounding the island, making it less prone to flooding and more attractive to developers.

The planned digging is part of an effort to make the riverfront a destination officials hope will attract tourists and spending.“We would envision something like San Antonio River Walk, Branson Landing,” said Brad Temme, chief engineer for the city. “Something where you have a mixed-use retail/entertainment district that is alongside a water feature.”The $2 million line item was slipped into the budget by Sen. Bill Eigel, R-Weldon Spring, who represents the area in question, which is just south of the Interstate 70 bridge heading into St. Charles. The city owns the island and leases it to the county.The county operates a 160-acre park on the island, complete with trails and wildlife viewing. The park itself would remain untouched and would remain owned by the city, Temme said. But the city owns private land facing the island, which it would like to sell.“In order to get the land to where it would be attractive to private investment, they need to do something about that side channel that’s been filled in,” Eigel said on the Senate floor last week. “That’s where this money comes in. So this money is preparing the land that the city owns to be able to support future private development.”He said the channel would resemble a shallow reflecting pool, but Temme said officials had still not decided on what the channel would ultimately look like.Not everyone is happy about the state spending.“Why is it the state’s responsibility to take care of St. Charles’ private infrastructure concerns?” asked Sen. Jill Schupp, D-Creve Coeur. “Why would the people of my district, or any other district in the state, want to hand over this money to St. Charles for St. Charles’ benefit — solely for St. Charles’ benefit. So, I’m concerned about it.”Eigel said other local infrastructure projects the state funds aren’t considered handouts, and he said the filling in of side channels on the Missouri River contributes to flooding.He said the city had originally sought grant money through the Army Corps of Engineers.
To demonstrate to the federal government that the project had proper backing, Eigel said the city pushed a nonbinding resolution through the Legislature last year that voiced support for the project. The city has said that it would put up millions of dollars of city money to fund the digging of the channel.But, Eigel said, efforts to draw money from the corps were unsuccessful.Enter the state.“They (St. Charles officials) were looking for a little bit of assistance to help with this particular infrastructure project,” Eigel said. “I am very supportive of infrastructure projects around the state, like this, to help cities — you know, St. Charles or otherwise — to grow.”
When Eigel said this, Schupp cracked a joke.“You were the first one on board with the transportation (bonding proposal),” Schupp said on the Senate floor. “I’m being a little bit facetious.”Eigel’s abrasiveness in the Senate this session adds another wrinkle to this story. He is one of the leaders of the Senate Conservative Caucus, a six-member bloc of Republicans in the 34-member Senate that has filibustered numerous pieces of legislation this year.Among the items that Eigel initially opposed was Gov. Mike Parson’s $350 million bonding proposal that sought to repair more than 200 bridges across the state, none of them in Eigel’s district. Senators said at the time that rural areas of the state had dire infrastructure needs, unlike the relatively well-off St. Charles County.

“If someone is concerned they are not getting enough attention, they just may be blessed that they have good bridges,” Senate President Pro Tem Dave Schatz, R-Sullivan, said in January.The Conservative Caucus has threatened to torpedo numerous priorities this year. The Post-Dispatch reported Wednesday that in an internal email obtained by the newspaper, Eigel said the group had “pushed chamber anxiety to a high level” and said the group should “stall” Senate business unless its priorities gain traction.Sen. Mike Cierpiot, R-Lee’s Summit, in a recent speech on the Senate floor, raised questions about the Bangert Island project.“We’ve heard a lot this year about conservatives,” Cierpiot said. “One wants $2 million for an island in St. Louis — St. Louis, not Florida — for redevelopment. Picking winners and losers. ... I’m likely to support many of these issues, but I’m not claiming purity as some do.”Since the House did not budget any money for the island project, the two chambers will have to agree to the Senate’s position if the line item is to survive the legislative process and make it to Parson’s desk.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Tsichlis: STEM Education Needs HELP,"Apr 30, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/columnists/tsichlis-stem-education-needs-help/article_0430e2ae-c636-5013-b13d-303a1cef3805.html,"For over a decade, the dizzying pace of scientific and technological innovation has prompted educators to place greater emphasis on instructing K-12 students in science, technology, engineering, and math, or STEM. To better meet the needs of a tech-driven workforce, Gov. Mike Parson signed a bill in October authorizing the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education to create a “STEM Career Awareness Program,” that encourages students to explore those fields beginning in sixth grade.Few challenge the need for quality education in those fields. What is often left out of the conversation, however, are the potentially challenging ethical quandaries that can result from scientific innovation. For example, many would consider it a noble goal if medical advances supported by work in genetics, nanotechnology and cybernetics produced treatments and cures that lengthen our lifespan and enhance our quality of life. On the other hand, are we willing to accept the risks to privacy and possible discrimination that go with others accessing our genetic profiles?Expect a Pandora’s Box of such questions to be unleashed in coming years. Who will benefit from such applications? Who will not? Will there be a choice? Are we prepared to relinquish such important ethical decisions to tech elites or the algorithmic conclusions of artificial intelligence itself? Is this the path for a society that claims to live by democratic values?

The challenge with today’s children is how to best steer them through such ethical dilemmas. Such guideposts are readily found in the fields of humanities, ethics, literature, and philosophy, or HELP.HELP directly ties to STEM. Corresponding to the all-encompassing, multi-disciplinary term “science,” humanities refers to that broad array of studies in human experience — particularly history — that traces the trajectory of human development and its related progress, challenges, and dangers.Paralleling technology is the study of ethics, the tools by which we understand and make moral choices. As engineering concerns the language of design, so too does literature provide the narrative language of human experiences, such as life lessons and moral dilemmas pondered in works like “I, Robot,” among others. Finally, as mathematics is the study of the world by numeric precision, philosophy suggests ways to navigate the imprecise world and messy relationships between human perception and action.
The disciplines of humanities, ethics, literature, and philosophy will not only be essential to future workers in scientific research and development, but for all who grapple with the proper applications and limits to these developments in a democratic society. The emphasis is not principally to ask “How do we do it?” but rather “Whom will it benefit?”, “How might it do harm?”, and ultimately “Should we do it?” It’s about what millennia of collective experience has shown us. It’s about wisdom-building.Science doesn’t happen in a value-free vacuum. Developing a research question or hypothesis is itself an exercise laden with presuppositions based on one’s priorities and values. If society is to remain built on freedom and participation — and not merely a race to keep up with advances in science, technology, engineering and math with little reflection on their consequences — HELP subjects will be essential to the K-12 education. The lessons of humanities, ethics, literature and philosophy are as vital as their STEM counterparts.
There is also a diversity of personal, family, cultural, and faith-based foundations that undergird students’ ethical and moral decision-making developed outside of public schools. But K-12 students spend the bulk of their young lives in a school-based setting, and the least we can do is ensure the instruction they receive includes the fundamentals of how to make the best possible choices.If we fail to engage our children in the discernment between right and wrong, it will be left to others to do it for them, be they corporations, government entities or the next upgrade in artificial intelligence.Michael G.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Overnight filibuster in Missouri Senate ends in win for ag groups that want to lure big farms,"Apr 30, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/business/local/overnight-filibuster-in-missouri-senate-ends-in-win-for-ag/article_1a36bcb0-bfae-5464-a148-14905e180e4d.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • A proposal to do away with local rules on big farms earned initial approval Tuesday in the Missouri Senate after an overnight filibuster from Democrats concerned about pollution caused by concentrated animal feeding operations.Twenty counties, mostly in the northern half of the state, have sought to regulate the large animal operations known as CAFOs through local health ordinances. But the GOP-backed proposal says counties cannot enact rules more stringent than state standards.Democrats earlier this session stalled a vote on the measure, but they allowed passage Tuesday morning after about 12 hours of debate. They won a concession: setback requirements for what are known as “export only” CAFOs — operations that ship manure to other farms.

The Democrats were concerned that owners could spray anywhere, with no safeguards for streams or public lands. Some farms near CAFOs welcome the manure, which is a fertilizer that can be offered for free.














        
            Missouri counties slap rules on large farms. State lawmakers want to strike back.

Opponents say something stinks about efforts to restrict local authority over big farms.

Jill Schupp, D-Creve Coeur, was allowed on the bill, Democrats sat down and allowed the bill to win initial approval on a voice vote.The measure needs one more vote before moving to the House, but with Senate Democrats — who maintain some leverage in the minority because of their filibuster power — out of the way, House Republicans could move fast to approve the bill before the Legislature’s adjournment May 17.Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican, cheered news of the approval on Twitter.“BIG win for Missouri farm & ranch families,” he said. The bill “opens doors to meet growing world food demand and ensures we keep more agriculture production in our state, strengthening Missouri’s #1 industry!”
Proponents have said local ordinances create a “hodgepodge” of regulations that have stalled expansion of modern agriculture techniques in the state.“Farming like we used to farm doesn’t feed the world anymore,” said Sen. Mike Bernskoetter, R-Jefferson City, who sponsored the legislation.But opponents — flanked by a vocal statewide network of neighbors affected by the facilities — have said state regulations are lacking, allowing the big farms to run amok.
It is unclear, said Brian Smith of the Missouri Rural Crisis Center, whether a new law would nullify local ordinances that are already in place — but the intent of the legislation, backers say, is to create a uniform set of regulations statewide.The agriculture industry in recent days has increased its lobbying presence in the Capitol.The Missouri Cattlemen’s Association, for example, previously had three lobbyists working for it but has hired five more lobbyists since April 19, according to Missouri Ethics Commission records.The Missouri Pork Association hired two more lobbyists last week, increasing its ranks to four lobbyists.The legislation is Senate Bill 391.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Over two years after big HUD grant, Preservation Square project finally nears groundbreaking","Apr 27, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/business/local/over-two-years-after-big-hud-grant-preservation-square-project/article_ea43dfa3-f795-5188-b45d-88d466373a7c.html,"After the holdup of state tax credits delayed work for years, a multimillion-dollar reconstruction of the 675-unit Preservation Square subsidized-housing community is finally close to breaking ground.Owner McCormack Baron Salazar hopes to begin the $17.9 million first phase of construction by the end of the year — three years since the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development gave St. Louis a $30 million grant to kick-start the near North Side project.“Based on our engagement of families, they’re ready for it,” said Urban Strategies President Esther Shin, who has been overseeing social services and case management in the neighborhood partly funded with the HUD grant. “There’s a lot of anticipation for the transformation. We’ve been getting a lot of phone calls and questions about when, because we have been waiting a significant amount of time for the housing transformation to move forward.”

The $30 million grant was part of the federal Choice Neighborhoods program developed under the Obama administration, and HUD selected St. Louis for inclusion in the last days of that administration. In addition to completely rehabbing Preservation Square, sandwiched between downtown and the site of the future western headquarters of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, it is also intended to fund health, employment and other services for neighborhood residents.While those human services programs started soon after the grant was awarded in December 2016, the planned overhaul of Preservation Square stalled as a key piece of its financing was held up in Jefferson City. Even now, the first phase redoing 131 apartments isn’t expected to be complete until March 2021.Former Gov. Eric Greitens’ November 2017 move to have the Missouri Housing Development Commission block the issuance of low-income housing tax credits left a big hole in McCormack Baron’s financing plan. The program had taken bipartisan criticism over the years for being inefficient, but supporters say both nonprofits and for-profits use it to build affordable housing and that it’s one of the few programs left to develop in the poorest neighborhoods of the state.Missouri had historically matched the federal share of low-income housing tax credits allocated to the state, making it one of the most generous state programs. Greitens’ appointees to the state commission that oversaw the program blocked the state match and threatened to withhold the federal credits, too, if other commissioners did not go along.

The Choice Neighborhoods grant would help city redevelop a housing complex and provide services near the NGA.




The ensuing Greitens political scandal and uncertainty in state government delayed the award of even the federal credits until October, when the MHDC granted McCormack Baron a federal low-income housing tax credit allocation for the first phase of the project worth $1.18 million annually for 10 years.The first phase of the Preservation Square project will construct 45 new units and rehab 86 existing units. Of those, 37 units will be market rate, with the idea that residents who improve their income and lose eligibility for federal housing assistance or rent restrictions can stay in the neighborhood.McCormack Baron is also seeking 15 years of property tax abatement, which a key city board endorsed Tuesday. The St. Louis Board of Aldermen must give final approval to the incentive, which would abate 95 percent of the taxes on the improvements for a decade and 50 percent for the last five years.
The company is also planning to tap about $1.2 million from a National Affordable Housing Trust Fund loan and use about $6 million of the Choice Neighborhoods HUD grant. The total cost of the project, which includes nonconstruction costs, is estimated at $24.79 million, according to materials submitted to the MHDC.About $20 million of the HUD grant is dedicated to the Preservation Square building project. The second phase, which includes building and renovating 158 units, is expected to start toward the end of next year and take about 18 months. The third and fourth phases should start in late 2021 and 2022 respectively. A final phase will redo 140 units at the nearby Brewery apartments on North 20th Street, another McCormack Baron property.But the timing of those future phases will depend on the availability of low-income housing tax credits. Missouri Gov. Mike Parson called for reform of the program in the Legislature before issuing more state credits. The Missouri Senate passed a plan to lower the state issuance to 72.5 percent of what it receives from the federal government.

St. Louis is among five cities to receive Choice Neighborhoods grants from the Obama administration.





“It makes it a much more complicated project if the state programs are not available, but our hope is we can find other sources to get the project done for our residents,” McCormack Baron Salazar spokeswoman Cady Seabaugh said.The construction delay did cause some residents to become “disenchanted,” said Shin, the Urban Strategies president working with Preservation Square families. But now, some people are already moving to the Brewery apartments to make way for construction in Preservation Square, a complex developed almost 40 years ago. Research shows quality housing can promote better health and other benefits, she said.“Folks sometimes don’t realize just how much the housing will change and how much it will improve,” Shin said.













Esther Shin, president of Urban Strategies Inc., a national nonprofit organization that works to revitalize neighborhoods.


Meanwhile, the social services funded by the grant will continue for another five years. While the city will direct about $4.5 million of the HUD grant toward neighborhood improvements, Urban Strategies is using the other $4.5 million to coordinate case management with Preservation Square residents and connect them with health, employment and counseling services. Those services are provided by organizations such as SSM Health, Ranken Technical College, and Justine Petersen.“Almost everything that we connect families to is free, because we know that our families are hamstrung when it comes to expenses,” Shin said.So far, about half of the families in Preservation Square have engaged with Urban Strategies case managers, and about 20 percent of the surrounding neighborhood’s residents, she said. Her group has measured increases in primary care doctor utilization and employment, though average earned income has declined slightly. It’s trying to figure out why so it can better direct services to the families there.“It’s not that families don’t want services, it’s that a lot of them don’t know what’s available,” Shin said.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Revelations cast doubt on Missouri's claim that 'improved economy' shrunk Medicaid rolls,"Apr 25, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/revelations-cast-doubt-on-missouri-s-claim-that-improved-economy/article_d4143092-a9fa-5aeb-97c1-a38ffc27a0a0.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Gov. Mike Parson’s administration has said an improving economy was the key reason behind an abrupt drop in the number of Missourians receiving Medicaid last year, but newly found processing errors by the state cast doubt on those claims.Advocates for Medicaid recipients say the renewal system adopted last spring by the Department of Social Services automatically renews only a low rate of recipients and operates with several data access issues. That’s at least one reason why an estimated 70,000 people dropped off the state’s Medicaid rolls last year, they say.One glitch in the system, the advocates say, is in violation of federal law.

Federal regulations require states to determine recipients’ Medicaid eligibility by first checking a variety of sources for patient income information, including data from its Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP. Missouri’s renewal system has never checked SNAP data since its implementation last spring.Joel Ferber, director of advocacy for the Legal Services of Eastern Missouri, said this meant someone could report their income information to SNAP one week, then find out they have to go through the process again for Medicaid.In a worst-case scenario, he said, recipients never receive the Medicaid application and then find out they’ve been dropped despite already self-reporting their income to the state.“Every child that has needed our help has been eligible for Medicaid or CHIP,” Ferber said. “They only lost coverage because their parents were unable to get over the unnecessary bureaucratic hurdles. We have had children unable to get their asthma medication, unable to be treated for ringworm and kept out of school, unable to receive their psychiatric medication, unable to receive physical therapy.”St. Louis University law professor Sidney Watson said the ultimate repercussion for violating federal Medicaid regulations would be cutting off funding, but that has never happened. Instead, if an infringement was found, Watson said, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) more likely would send a corrective action letter instructing the state to fix the problem by a certain time.“The intent behind those regulations was to assure that when information was available to the state, and it is available to the state, they just have to make the computer system work,” Watson said. “There are federal matching funds to create those computer systems to keep them up-to-date. It’s a matter of will.”Missouri’s renewal program also funnels patients with no income through the manual renewal process, even though they clearly qualify for Medicaid.Another error: For several months after its implementation, the renewal system did not have access to recipients’ federal tax income information. For the state to access this database, individuals have to provide consent, but the system was not programmed to include this field.Pat Luebbering, director of the Family Support Division of the Department of Social Services, told the MoHealthNet oversight committee last week that the system still faced other issues in accessing federal income information when the state had mismatching personal identification information with what the federal system required.Because of the glitches, MoHealthNet has fewer ways to access patient income information and, thus, less ability to automatically renew patients.Ferber said he and other Legal Services members had confirmed each of the renewal system errors with Department of Social Services officials over the past few months. The department did not directly answer the Post-Dispatch’s questions regarding the issues after department spokeswoman Rebecca Woelfel said “we respectfully decline” an interview with administrators to address the concerns.In a later statement, the department acknowledged it planned to build a new tracking system that integrates SNAP with Medicaid eligibility.It is unclear if the agency tracked exactly how many Missourians should have been automatically renewed who instead had to self-report their income information or how many of those qualified recipients were eventually dropped from the Medicaid rolls.
But MoHealthNet does keep track of how of many patients were renewed automatically: about 11 percent on average in recent months, according to the Department of Social Services.Missouri is among the bottom 10 states that automatically renew less than a quarter of Medicaid recipients, according to a nationwide report conducted by the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation. On the other end of the spectrum, 10 states are able to automatically renew over 75 percent of recipients.Luebbering pointed out last week that only about 100,000 cases went through the renewal process last year. The large majority of recipients’ eligibility was updated when they came in contact with the department sometime during the year.The Department of Social Services statement sent to the Post-Dispatch says the department is working with the federal government to explore ways the state can automatically renew Medicaid determination reliably through federal data.
Though the state’s economy has improved, Missouri’s coverage of children has dropped dramatically compared with other states’.Children accounted for about 56,700 of the former Medicaid recipients in the 2018 drop, amounting to a 9.1 percent decline in coverage — five times the national decline in children’s coverage, according to federal Medicaid data.Tim McBride, chairman of the oversight committee, has remained stuck on the number of children who fell out of eligibility. He said that even if a parent’s income increased and they subsequently dropped off the rolls, their children should still remain eligible for Medicaid.“I’m frustrated with the view that I think they still attribute a lot of this change to the improving economy, which I believe is part of the story, but a pretty small part of it,” McBride said. “Whenever I push, that’s the answer we get, and that’s sort of the public answer.”Going through the manual renewal process rather than being automatically renewed does not necessarily mean a recipient will be dropped from the rolls, but both sides agreed self-reporting comes with challenges.The department found that of the Missourians dropped from Medicaid last year, 43,200 failed to return renewal forms for various reasons and 20,000 were dropped because the department was unable to locate them, according to letters the Department of Social Services sent to House Minority Leader Crystal Quade, D-Springfield, and Sen. Scott Sifton, D-south St. Louis County.During the February oversight committee meeting, Luebbering said it was difficult to reach some Medicaid recipients. The agency began mailing out a series of alerts, tweeting warnings and sending robocall reminders in November after tens of thousands had already been removed from the rolls.Committee members brought up a list of hoops Medicaid recipients must jump through when renewing membership themselves, including extended call center wait times, lack of access to online resources and applications that arrive only in English.Ferber said some of his clients were even turned away when visiting Family Service offices in person and were told to instead call the toll-free number.While the Department of Social Services continues to study what caused the decline, rolls continue to drop. In the first three months of 2019 alone, the department’s data show more than 12,000 more people, including 9,500 additional children, no longer have Medicaid coverage.“This is clearly a red flag that needs to be investigated,” Watson said. “Children need health insurance, and they need health coverage. We should be concerned and ask questions when we see thousands of kids losing coverage.”

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri revenues tick up as Senate debates $30 billion budget,"Apr 24, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-revenues-tick-up-as-senate-debates-billion-budget/article_5b8b8a50-2871-5e49-aca4-2cd97fa33d0e.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • State revenue collections have ticked up in recent days — welcome news for legislators tasked with writing the state’s $30 billion budget.The Missouri Senate took up on Wednesday the spending plan for next fiscal year, voting to spend $62 million more on K-12 education, which would fully fund the state’s funding formula. Public colleges and universities also would see small increases to core funding.The increases come after months of worry over the state’s financial outlook. This year’s budget assumes a 1.7 percent growth in revenue over last year, but collections had fallen far short of that benchmark until recently.

As of March 25, for example, collections were down $353 million from the same point in 2018, or 5.3 percent.But, as of Tuesday, the state had collected $34.7 million more than at the same point last year, a 0.47 percent increase — better, but still not at the 1.7 percent anticipated growth.“We are optimistic that we are going to be in the net positive,” said Steele Shippy, spokesman for Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican. But, he said, as collections fluctuate, “we’re prepared to balance the budget as needed.”Next year’s budget, for the fiscal year starting July 1, assumes 2 percent growth in revenue. That could mean cuts to spending if there were an economic downturn, said Sen. Scott Sifton, D-south St. Louis County.“This budget might potentially be out of balance” under that scenario, he said Wednesday.Still, the Senate spent the morning debating increased funding for education. In addition to the funding formula increase, the Senate also allocated $10 million more than this year for school transportation costs.The House recommended a $5 million increase, meaning the two sides will have to come to an agreement in a conference committee. School districts have long complained that the state has not adequately funded transportation costs.As the state has reduced the percentage of transportation costs it has covered over the last three decades, school districts have had to pay for more of the costs.“I’m glad to see the Senate has proposed and adopted a higher position on transportation funding, but it’s still underfunded,” said Sen. Lauren Arthur, D-Kansas City.The Senate also reduced the appropriation for Parson’s proposed Fast-Track scholarship program from $18.5 million to $10 million. The legislation authorizing the new scholarship for students 25 and older has yet to clear the Legislature.
“This is a bill that hasn’t passed,” said Senate Budget Chairman Dan Hegeman, R-Cosby, who said he funded the program despite reservations about funding yet-to-be-approved programs. “It is a new program — a startup program that may or may not pass.”The Senate appropriated $50 million in general revenue for bridge repairs, down from the House’s $100 million appropriation.Senate budget writers also appropriated $35 million for a program that would allow localities and the state to share the cost of infrastructure improvements.
House Speaker Elijah Haahr, R-Springfield, said last week that the revenue situation would continue to improve as the state began to cash checks that taxpayers sent in around Tax Day, April 15.Haahr was among those who waited until April 15 to pay his taxes.“I don’t think my check has cleared yet, so I think that will continue to move in the right direction,” he said on Thursday.Haahr also said the positive trend could lessen the push for revenue generating alternatives like enforcing sales taxes on online purchases or expanding gambling by legalizing video gambling in bars, gas stations and truck stops and allowing casinos to offer sports wagering.“Obviously, that probably changes the complexion,” Haahr said.Haahr said talks on those issues would continue nonetheless.Senate leaders said the push to expand gambling should not be linked to shortfalls in revenue.“I would never advocate for that to be a way to fill our budget with gambling revenue,” Senate President Pro Tem Dave Schatz, R-Sullivan, said Thursday.Differences between the House and Senate budget plans will have to be worked out in a conference committee before Parson considers the final products.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Editorial: Captain awaits justice from Missouri National Guard after sexual assault,"Apr 24, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-captain-awaits-justice-from-missouri-national-guard-after-sexual/article_82501521-1a82-5625-adac-7125c304c839.html,"Just when it appeared that women's voices were finally being heard around the country demanding justice for sexual assault and a halt to inappropriate behavior, the Missouri National Guard has taken a giant step backward on those same fronts. Heather Sexton, who was an Army captain but left active duty after 10 years of service, is living a kind of #MeToo nightmare: National Guard investigators confirmed she is the victim of sexual assault, yet they won't go after her assailant.If the military's decision is allowed to stand, Sexton will have received no more justice than if authorities had ignored her case in the first place. It's time for members of Missouri's congressional delegation to take charge and insist her case receives the full hearing it deserves.As the Post-Dispatch’s Tony Messenger reported, Sexton summoned her courage and came forward immediately with her charges, only to be met with the legal equivalent of a pat on the head. The investigating team confirmed that after a social event at Camp Williams in Utah, a sergeant grabbed “the victim’s groin and breast and stomach” without her consent. But the same team “found insufficient evidence to determine the reported perpetrator’s intent of the physical contact, thus we are unable to establish that intentional sexual contact occurred.”

After the investigation, Sexton was included on an email addressed to the entire unit from Gen. David Boyle, the Guard's joint task commander, admonishing the group for serving alcohol at the Utah event and calling for them to “exercise better judgement and comport yourselves appropriately” in the future. Her inclusion in the email made it appear as if she was also being admonished.
Achieving justice in sexual assault cases is particularly difficult when the allegations boil down to he-said/she-said. But in this case, investigators had ample testimony to support Sexton's allegations. The findings were as if a jury handed down a guilty verdict, only to grant the defendant a pardon and a clean record.“I’m an officer, and this happened to me,” Sexton said. “What happens when a private gets sexually assaulted? I felt a strong responsibility as a leader to make sure this doesn’t happen to other women.”
It almost feels as if the Missouri National Guard wants Sexton to be content just knowing she was right. But leave weighty questions of justice to the menfolk.Merely acknowledging a crime is not, and has never been, justice by itself. Sexton has written to various Republicans — Gov. Mike Parson, Sen. Josh Hawley, Sen. Roy Blunt, and Rep. Ann Wagner — to make them aware of what has happened in her case. If they truly believe in the cause of justice and equal rights for women, they will not allow this case to fade into obscurity."
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Republican-on-Republican angst jams up the Missouri Senate,"Apr 24, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/republican-on-republican-angst-jams-up-the-missouri-senate/article_7be63e71-d312-528c-b3c7-207d9411b16a.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • The leader of a bloc of conservative Missouri senators is threatening to sink at least four major initiatives sought by Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican, as the Legislature heads into its final weeks.According to an email obtained by the Post-Dispatch, Sen. Bill Eigel, R-Weldon Spring, wants the six-member Conservative Caucus to use its ability to stall action in the GOP-controlled upper chamber to leverage votes on an internet sales tax collection bill, a charter school expansion proposal and legislation that would allow slot machines in bars, gas stations and fraternal organizations.In the email, Eigel expresses frustration that his group’s priorities aren’t being debated after the members allowed a transportation funding plan backed by the governor to move forward.

“We pushed chamber anxiety to a high level and then left the battlefield at the height of the stress allowing a couple … priorities to pass,” Eigel said. “Now comes time for the Republican Caucus to reciprocate — and yet, stunningly, they may have other ideas in mind!”“Despite our assurance we’d be getting to our stuff and warnings that failure to do so this week would cause trouble, here we are,” the April 14 email notes.Eigel told the Post-Dispatch Wednesday that he remained hopeful the situation would turn in his favor.“Things do seem to be shaking loose a little, so I’m cautiously optimistic,” Eigel said.The email is the latest example of heightened tension in the Senate, which is controlled by Eigel’s fellow Republicans.With a May 17 adjournment looming and major proposals stuck, the chamber has already boiled over once because of the caucus’ tactics.Last week, Sen. Mike Cierpiot, R-Lee’s Summit, lashed out at the group, which includes Republican Sens. Eric Burlison of Springfield, Denny Hoskins of Warrensburg, Cindy O’Laughlin of Shelbina, Andrew Koenig of Manchester and Bob Onder of Lake Saint Louis.“I have made efforts to reach compromise with this group, thought we had an agreement and watched that agreement evaporate,” Cierpiot said. “I’m finished with that approach, with that group, unless things change.”Cierpiot questioned how the caucus could claim conservative “purity” while backing issues such as expanding gambling.“They might rename themselves the Inconsistent Caucus because they certainly are,” Cierpiot said. “Or maybe the Chaos Caucus, because that seems to be what their efforts are mostly after.”
The caucus was formed in January as a subset of the 24-member Republican supermajority in the Senate. At the time, they said their priorities included abortion, gun rights and smaller government.Eigel said the caucus’ support of expanded gambling was meant to address a rise in illegal slot machines in the state.“If a compromise could be reached that addresses this as part of a small expansion that stays within constitutional bounds, I’m interested,” he said.Among other items Eigel said the caucus might block is a long-sought prescription drug monitoring program backed by Sen. Dave Schatz, R-Sullivan.On Tuesday, in a sign that Senate leaders were aware of the caucus’ threat to filibuster, the PDMP legislation — considered a key part of fighting the opioid epidemic — was skipped on the agenda.
Eigel also suggested the caucus would block Parson’s job-creation programs, including an adult college scholarship proposal, a revamp of the Department of Economic Development and two bills that he said would streamline the agency’s ability to lure businesses to Missouri.Eigel called the latter “slush funds.”He also warned that a gasoline tax increase sponsored by Sen. Doug Libla, R-Poplar Bluff, could be targeted.The governor’s office had not seen the email. A spokesman said Parson continued to work with the Legislature.In a list of recommendations, Eigel said, “If our priorities don’t see the finish line this week, the chamber should be stalled until that occurs.”“It has always been my No. 1 fear that when the time came that we would be willing to negotiate and we would want to cash in on ‘goodwill,’ nothing would happen,” he noted.Senate Majority Leader Caleb Rowden, R-Columbia, played down the tension in comments to reporters.“It always gets interesting in the last month or so,” Rowden said. “We’re going to keep trying to make sure as many folks have the chance to get the stuff done that they want to get done, and that requires us working through some contentious moments off the floor, and sometimes it requires it on the floor.”

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Messenger: Battle against mass incarceration is making a dent in Missouri's prison population,"Apr 24, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/columns/tony-messenger/messenger-battle-against-mass-incarceration-is-making-a-dent-in/article_8552e14e-9f78-5e0e-9a39-66c8bf5d097a.html,"The letter from Dent County Jail contained good news.If you get letters from people in custody — and I get a fair amount — good news is a rarity. People locked up generally have plenty of good reason to complain.Not this time.

“You wouldn’t believe the changes that have taken place around here,” the woman wrote.She and I first corresponded last year, shortly after I began a series of columns on men and women in rural Missouri jails, held because they couldn’t afford to pay their jail “board bills” for previous misdemeanor sentences.She told me about the conditions in the jail, about the high cash bails that kept people there, about how they would plead guilty to whatever they were charged with just to get out.She introduced me to people who had been caught up in this debtors prison scheme.She was self-aware enough to know her case wouldn’t be sympathetic, so she was content to point me in the right direction and help those around her.There was a time, about a year or so ago, when the number of women in the Dent County Jail surpassed the men.“Perhaps women are less likely to get the money for bond, or maybe they are just easier to manipulate,” she speculated.That’s no longer the case.Last November, the judge who was most responsible for jailing people in Dent County over failure to pay court costs lost her election. The judge’s friend who ran the private probation company lost her job. When the Missouri Supreme Court ruled that it was illegal to jail people over failure to pay their jail board bills, the presiding judge in the circuit, Kelly Parker, started releasing people from their illegal debts.“What you probably haven’t heard is how the atmosphere has changed,” my friend wrote me last week. “The jail is emptying out. People that do come in are able to bond out quickly. None of the girls here are being held for financial reasons. This place isn’t the terrifying dungeon it used to feel like. The new judges are actually listening to people’s needs instead of sending them straight to prison.”This is progress, and it’s not limited to one rural Missouri county.
Last year, Missouri led the nation in reducing its rate of mass incarceration. That positive detail is contained in a new report released by the Vera Institute of Justice on Wednesday, showing that criminal justice reforms nationally are having a positive effect.Between 2017 and 2018, the Vera report determined, the rate of incarceration in Missouri dropped by 7.1 percent, a more precipitous decline by rate than any other state in the country. The federal decline was 1.3 percent. The report looks strictly at state prison numbers, and the authors point to a few likely reasons for the reduction in mass incarceration in Missouri, says Jacob Kang-Brown, a senior research associate at Vera.First, in early 2017, the state’s first major overhaul of the criminal code took effect. It dropped sentences on many minor crimes, such as marijuana possession; streamlined many repetitive charges; added parole in cases that didn’t previously have it; and added a fifth level of felony for crimes that don’t deserve harsh sentences.Also, in St. Louis, voters elected reform-minded prosecutors, Kimberly M. Gardner in the city and Wesley Bell in the county, and both promised to reform the bail system and stop seeking jail time for some minor offenses, such as child support prosecutions in the county.
While Vera’s study doesn’t address local jail populations, both the city and county have dropped their daily jail counts significantly in the past two years, and often, that is a precursor to a reduced state jail population.Last year, Missouri started a “justice reinvestment” project working with the U.S. Department of Justice and the Pew Charitable Trusts which seeks to reduce recidivism by improving behavioral health treatment options and probation supervision.All of those efforts are contributing to the decline in Missouri prison population. So will Gov. Mike Parson’s effort to close a state prison, and the effect on the Missouri Supreme Court decision on the jail board bills, which should reduce incentives for counties to try to fill the pipeline from county jail to state prison.None of that will help my pen pal. She’s likely headed to prison after her stay in Dent County.Meanwhile, Missouri lawmakers are debating several measures that could continue criminal justice reform measures in the state, reducing the state’s prison population, and sending people who have served their time back to their communities, where they can rebuild lives, contribute to the economy and get a fresh start.“Criminal justice reform is working,” Kang-Brown says.In some respects, Missouri is leading the way.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Life sciences respect essential to Missouri patients and economy,"Apr 22, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/columnists/life-sciences-respect-essential-to-missouri-patients-and-economy/article_c52e8eb1-0aaf-56dc-9cbb-56ae2988b699.html,"Missouri’s freshman senator likely had a number of his constituents scratching their heads this month when he attacked a valued economic engine in his own state to promote his newly filed price-control legislation. Republican Sen. Josh Hawley, in his first three months on the job, took a swipe at one of the most important industries we have in Missouri — indeed, in this country — and we need to provide important context to his poor choice of words.Hawley’s characterization referred to “Big Pharma” being “not good actors.” The life sciences industry is incredibly important to our local economy, and the interwoven collaborative work of large and small pharma is vital to every person in this state who has ever needed a prescription.In Missouri, the life sciences industry employs nearly 30,000 people, supporting families from St. Joseph to St. Louis. Innovation in health, biopharma and agriculture technology are creating high-skill jobs — with average annual wages at $76,000 — spurring economic growth and improving the lives of Missourians.

A few recent examples: Boehringer Ingelheim in St. Joseph, celebrated its centennial last year, and today employs nearly 1,000 people. Pfizer is opening a nearly $240 million global research and development hub in Chesterfield next month, employing nearly 600 scientists. Bayer completed its acquisition of Monsanto last year, solidifying St. Louis as its global center for crop science. And that’s just a few. There are hundreds more biopharma enterprises just as important, if not brand-recognizable.In his new legislative role, I hope that Hawley can be a promoter of economic expansion across the state by supporting life science research and creating a pro-business environment for expansion of these fast-growth companies. Innovations led by the life sciences industry — from small businesses and startups to large companies — are an American success story which is good news, not a point of attack.Right now, more than 900 biotech drugs are in clinical development targeting cancer, cardiovascular diseases, Alzheimer’s and thousands of rare diseases. What patients pay for prescription medications is way more complex than simply blaming pharmaceutical companies. Costs for prescriptions are determined by multiple complex factors, including deductibles and co-pays in insurance plans, generic alternatives, employers and what they offer, distributors and pharmaceutical-benefits managers along with research, manufacturing and the decade-long federal approval process.Other state leaders have taken a commendable approach to supporting Missouri’s needs and future.
Gov. Mike Parson visited more than 50 biotech facilities across Missouri during the last decade. He followed up on that listening tour by supporting new funding for research in higher education, and for state programs and policies that will commercialize those discoveries and create new companies. These startups are often the outsourced research and development teams for more mature pharma enterprises.
In March, Sen. Roy Blunt announced that the National Institutes of Health would receive $39.1 billion in appropriated funding this year. This allows for investments in medical research to generate new advanced biologics and lower drug costs. Blunt knows that when the NIH is well funded, Missouri wins. In 2018, Blunt received the national Innovator in Biotechnology award for his leadership.Fifty-seven years ago, noted economist Milton Friedman explored the roles of capitalism and democracy. Politicians, he noted, often are tempted to give government a greater role and markets a smaller one. Friedman explained that economic policy is often not decided on the basis of careful thought but rather on the limited (non-expert) viewpoints of elected officials and their voters.For politicians who want to lead us down the path of government price controls, I’d ask them to support the strength of the free market. Those elected officials can advocate for policies that allow companies to innovate, with competition and the market cycle of ever emerging generics serving as a much more powerful self-regulator.Despite his poor choice of words, my inclination is to believe that Hawley wants to support a major economic engine that provides jobs and saves lives. We invite him to see Missouri bioscience work in action and meet the scientists who toil for entire careers, providing tangible cures and relief for patients.Kelly Gillespie is president and chief executive of the Missouri Biotechnology Association, a statewide nonprofit trade association.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Rollout of medical marijuana in Missouri hits another pothole,"Apr 22, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/rollout-of-medical-marijuana-in-missouri-hits-another-pothole/article_8e6269aa-3bfc-59f3-a356-a6573b5c3b10.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Missouri’s fledgling medical marijuana program could be facing its second lawsuit after a company bidding to help run the initiative cried foul over the awarding of a contract to a competitor.In a protest filed with the state Thursday, an attorney for BioTrackTHC said the awarding of a contract to register patients, license facilities and track marijuana from seed to sale to Metrc LLC was flawed because the winner did not disclose fees that would be charged to growers and other vendors.Those fees could have helped Metrc outflank competitors by lowering what it charges the state, the protest noted.

The protest seeks to void the contract with Metrc and award the potentially lucrative job to BioTrack based on a point system used by the state when it evaluates bids.“Competitive bidding procedures must ensure that all who wish to bid have a fair opportunity to compete in a field where no favoritism is shown to other contestants,” the protest notes.Although the protest could be resolved before it reaches a courtroom, it comes as the Department of Health and Senior Services is being sued by the Post-Dispatch over the decision to withhold the names of nearly 500 companies and individuals that are seeking to grow, process and sell marijuana products.Voters approved Amendment 2 in November, making Missouri the 33rd state to legalize marijuana for medicinal use. Sales are to start early next year. Tax proceeds and licensing fees are supposed to go into a newly created veterans health care fund, which is expected to generate about $20 million per year.But the amendment allows the state to dip into the fund to administer the program. The Missouri House has also approved legislation that would force the state to use the veterans fund when handling medical marijuana-related lawsuits, meaning the net amount going to veterans could be far less than $20 million per year as the state implements its program.BioTrack and Metrc are among the top operators vying to help states administer their marijuana programs. Metrc has contracts with at least 10 states, while BioTrack has seven.BioTrack hired former Missouri House Speaker Steve Tilley to lobby on its behalf and retained Jefferson City lawyer Charles Hatfield, who is a former aide to former Gov. Jay Nixon, to submit the protest.In some states, different companies handle the various aspects of operating a medical marijuana program. But Missouri wants one company to do most of the information technology set-up for its licensing and tracking system. The contract with Metrc, if it survives the protest, will run for five years.Gov. Mike Parson’s administration would not say whether the protest would delay the program.“The protest is currently under review. We do not comment on pending protests,” said Brittany Ruess, spokeswoman for the Office of Administration.The contract is worth about $5 million, but Metrc could make millions more by charging vendors the fees.Missouri is required by law to approve at least 60 commercial growers, 86 facilities that manufacture marijuana-infused products and 192 dispensary licenses — 24 dispensaries for each of Missouri’s eight congressional districts.The St. Louis area will probably have more than 48 dispensaries. Two congressional districts cover St. Louis and St. Louis County and parts of St. Charles, Jefferson and Franklin counties.

Post-Dispatch suit
In the Sunshine Law case, meanwhile, attorneys for the Post-Dispatch and the Department of Health and Senior Services are scheduled to meet at 1:30 p.m. Monday in Cole County Circuit Court.The newspaper sued the state in January after officials refused to turn over the identities of the hundreds of entities seeking to grow, distribute or manufacture medicinal marijuana products in the state.The state has said the text of Amendment 2 precludes it from releasing any of the identifying information.The amendment says, in part, that the department “shall maintain the confidentiality of reports or other information obtained from an applicant or licensee containing any individualized data, information, or records related to the licensee or its operation … .”In the lawsuit, Post-Dispatch attorney Joseph Martineau argued the state was relying on an “overly restrictive interpretation” of that provision to justify concealing names of businesses and identifying information.“(T)he provision does not say that the Department ‘shall maintain the confidentiality of the applicant or licensee’ as well as the reports or other information obtained from the applicant or licensee,” Martineau argues.
Martineau wrote that the interpretation “is flawed, unsupported by the language of the provision, contrary to the provision’s intent, and disregards the important public policy that the process of applying for and awarding licenses to manufacture, distribute and dispense marijuana should be open and transparent.”Martineau said other records exemptions written into the state’s Sunshine Law were explicitly intended to conceal the identities from the public.Amendment 2 “says nothing about maintaining the confidentiality of the identity or identification of individuals or companies applying for licenses,” he said.On March 4, the attorney general’s office, on behalf of the health department, said Circuit Judge Daniel Green should apply a “traditional constitutional interpretation” to the constitutional clause that says the state should “maintain the confidentiality of … any information.”“The Post-Dispatch’s argument is laid bare repeatedly throughout its Petition where it is forced to argue that ‘any information related to the licensee of its operation’ doesn’t really mean any information,” the state argues. “By the Post-Dispatch’s reasoning, identifying information of applicants and their operations — obtained from the applicant— must be disclosed by the Department.”“The Post-Dispatch’s position is untenable and cannot be allowed to prevail over the will of Missouri voters and the plain language of the Constitutional provision they adopted overwhelmingly,” the state says.The newspaper responded on April 16 in a motion for summary judgment. Citing a section of the Sunshine Law that states “public records must be presumed open to public inspection unless they contain information which clearly fits within one of the [statutory] exemptions,” the newspaper said there was no clear exemption for the names of the applicants.The newspaper also cited a separate section stating that the Sunshine Law should be “liberally construed” in order to promote transparency.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri House backs landowners fighting wind energy line,"Apr 18, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/business/local/missouri-house-backs-landowners-fighting-wind-energy-line/article_7bb6de7f-da6d-55e0-8d78-1d9c304bd1b9.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • The Missouri House passed legislation Thursday that could effectively block one of the nation’s largest wind energy projects by prohibiting its developers from using eminent domain to run a high-voltage power line across the Midwest.The House vote targets a $2.3 billion project that would carry electricity generated by Kansas windmills on a 780-mile path across rural Missouri and Illinois before hooking into a power grid in Indiana serving eastern states.The project’s private developers say it has the potential to bring affordable, renewable energy to millions of homes. But the long-delayed power line has faced opposition from some property owners in its path and has had trouble clearing some regulatory requirements.

It appeared to overcome a major hurdle last month when Missouri utility regulators reversed previous denials and granted their approval — a step that could allow developers to pursue condemnation cases to acquire easements from unwilling sellers.But legislation intended to block that passed the House 115-35 and now heads to the Senate. On Thursday, Republican Gov. Mike Parson appeared to show support for the legislation.“I am a firm believer in protecting individual freedom and rights of private property owners, especially our farmers and ranchers,” Parson said in a written statement to The Associated Press. “We will continue to stay engaged with the legislature to ensure that we are equipped to protect all Missourians from potential threats of government overreach for private gain.”Former Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon, a Democrat, had backed the project and, after leaving office in 2017, successfully argued a case before the Missouri Supreme Court that overturned a prior regulatory rejection of it.If the Missouri legislation against eminent domain becomes law, the Grain Belt Express power line could be zapped — or at least forced to zigzag along a new route, if developers can find cooperative landowners.
Houston-based Clean Line Energy Partners has been working since 2010 to develop the direct-current line capable of transmitting about 4,000 megawatts of power. Chicago-based Invenergy announced last fall that it was acquiring the project, though the sale still needs regulatory approval.A coalition of municipal utilities already has agreed to buy a portion of the 500 megawatts of power that would be made available in Missouri — a deal that helped persuade utility regulators that the project is in the public interest.
Invenergy spokeswoman Beth Conley said the company is disappointed that Missouri lawmakers are attempting to stop the project. She said the power line could result in $32 million in payments to Missouri landowners and $7 million in property taxes to local Missouri governments in its first year of operation.The Missouri Public Utility Alliance said the cheaper wind power from the transmission line could save $12.8 million annually for the residents served by 39 municipal utilities.But some lawmakers said discounted electricity rates for certain people shouldn’t justify taking property rights away from others. Though most opponents focused on the potential use of eminent domain, Republican state Rep. Tim Remole also questioned the wisdom of relying on renewable energy.“The wind does not always blow, and the sun does not always shine,” Remole said. “We can depend on upon fossil fuels.”One of the project’s defenders is state Rep. Deb Lavender, a Democrat, whose hometown of Kirkwood plans to purchase some of the wind power.“It’s time for us to take our head out of the coal bin and realize there is a future for our children on this planet that we don’t seem to be watching out for,” Lavender said.

“Dr. Corsi has served our country nobly as a veteran and has been a great asset to the State of Missouri during his time as a Department Director,” Parson said.Corsi, who was earning $148,000 annually, was brought to Missouri by Gov. Eric Greitens after serving as director of a similar agency in Wyoming.Corsi came under scrutiny for being overpaid based on state statutes.While the budget called for him to receive $128,000 per year, he also was receiving a separate check from the Department of Health and Senior Services that raised his total take home pay to $142,000 annually.
Officials later altered the pay scale to allow him to be legally paid at his current level.Corsi is the latest holdover from the Greitens administration to depart. Parson ousted Department of Public Safety Director Drew Juden soon after taking office.And, embattled Department of Revenue Director Joel Walters announced his resignation last month after acknowledging he'd made mistakes in adjusting income tax withholding tables.
A psychologist by training, Corsi oversaw a sprawling agency that manages health care and other benefits for low-income and elderly Missourians, as well as provides services for juvenile offenders and the developmentally disabled.Parson credited Corsi with boosting programs designed to move more people into work and for helping foster children and youth.A replacement has not been named.“My administration will work over the coming weeks to identify new leadership that can continue to build on the positive reforms made within the department,” Parson said.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri lawmakers might pull the plug on wind energy line over eminent domain concerns,"Apr 16, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/business/local/missouri-lawmakers-might-pull-the-plug-on-wind-energy-line/article_bcf745e8-575c-5ac0-ae78-e20ef1124430.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • A plan to transmit wind energy into and through the state could be in jeopardy after the Missouri House gave initial approval on Tuesday to a measure that would forbid the project’s developer from using eminent domain to construct the line.The move comes a month after the Missouri Public Service Commission, which regulates utilities, deemed the Grain Belt Express transmission line in the public interest and granted the project “a certificate of convenience and necessity,” allowing the developer to use eminent domain in order to acquire easements for the project.The long-stalled line seeks to transmit Kansas wind energy through eight northern Missouri counties, through Illinois and Indiana, and to eastern states for consumption. The line would also deliver power to at least 350,000 Missourians and unlock energy savings of $12.8 million per year, based on contracts already reached with municipal utilities around the state.

After the PSC’s five commissioners appointed by multiple governors granted unanimous approval to the line, House Speaker Elijah Haahr, R-Springfield, said last month he would make the passage of a bill forbidding eminent domain for the project a priority.“The General Assembly will act to protect Missourians from private companies trying to seize their land through eminent domain,” Haahr said in a statement. “The legislation the House is moving forward is vital for many Missourians who otherwise would be forced to allow unreasonable restrictions on their family farms, damaging the value of their land and taking away their private property rights.”The legislation, sponsored by Rep. Jim Hansen, R-Frankford, bans eminent domain ""for the purposes of constructing above-ground merchant lines.""""This is just another attempt by a private companies and a government commission to eliminate our personal liberties,"" Hansen said of the project. “I am not opposed to green energy,” Hansen said. “I’m so opposed to a private company saying, ‘I’m gonna do this and you’re gonna like it — or else.’”Clean Line Energy Partners announced in November that it would sell rights to the transmission line to Chicago-based Invenergy. The PSC has yet to approve that sale.“We’re certainly opposed to anything that would slow, or work to slow, the benefits that the Grain Belt Express can bring to Missouri,” said Beth Conley, a spokesperson for Invenergy, who added that building the project would bring $500 million of direct investment and 1,500 jobs to the state, in addition to customer savings.“This project has been thoroughly vetted for more than five years by the Missouri PSC,” she said. “We feel good about that decision and their ability to adjudicate the case.”Rep. Peter Merideth, D-St. Louis, said he doesn’t like eminent domain, but he said he would oppose Hansen’s bill because it targets only one industry.""It seems like it is a bill that is designed with a very narrow focus because of one decision from the PSC about one project that some folks in the state don’t like,"" Merideth said.
The proposal still must win final approval in the House before moving to the Senate for consideration. Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican, has not taken a position on the measure.











With the legislation emerging to oppose the project’s use of eminent domain, a conference call was held last week by representatives of the Missouri communities that have signed up to receive power from the project.One by one, officials — often from rural parts of the state — described how the line stands to benefit local residents.
The communities of Lebanon, Rolla, Columbia and Kirkwood, for instance, each stand to see savings of more than $1 million a year from accessing the cheap energy provided by the project. Customer bases in Farmington, Hannibal, Jackson and Marshall, meanwhile, would each save around $500,000 annually.""Anytime lower pricing is injected into the market, we all benefit,"" said Mark Petty, director of the city-owned power utility, Kirkwood Electric. He noted that considerations about eminent domain were already taken into account during the PSC’s ""extensive process for the approval of the project,"" which it ruled was in the public interest.If the project is shot down by the legislation, supporters worry about what it would mean for future economic development efforts in the state.""My fear for that is the precedent it would set for any future project in the state of Missouri,"" said John Grotzinger, chief operating officer for the Missouri Joint Municipal Electric Utility Commission. ""Whether it’s electric, water, sewer, telecom ... (eminent domain) is a necessary evil and a last resort to make a project happen.""Complications could be especially tough on Missouri’s electric grid, which is awash in coal power despite sitting next to an abundance of increasingly cost-effective wind energy from Plains states. But transmission issues are widely seen as a key stumbling block when it comes to linking that power supply with growing demand from far-flung population centers.""For us, the transmission issue is huge,"" said Dennis Klusmeyer, the superintendent for the City of Shelbina. If the project comes on line, customers in the northern Missouri town of 1,600 people would trim electric costs by nearly 4 percent compared to the alternatives available to them.""This project is very worth the effort and is well-needed in Missouri. We are in need of infrastructure improvement in the state and across the country,"" he said.The legislation is House Bill 1062.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri Supreme Court says lieutenant governor appointment was legal,"Apr 16, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-supreme-court-says-lieutenant-governor-appointment-was-legal/article_d5e1880d-7146-54f3-9307-b90f4d7ba7f1.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • The Missouri Supreme Court says the state's lieutenant governor can stay lieutenant governor.In a 10-page decision signed by five members, the court rejected a Democratic-led effort to nullify Gov. Mike Parson’s June appointment of Mike Kehoe as lieutenant governor.Parson had held the $83,000-per-year position until he was elevated to the top job in state government following the resignation of Eric Greitens last year.

In the lawsuit, the Missouri Democratic Party sought to require that the lieutenant governor position be filled only by an election.Lead plaintiff Darrell Cope of Hartville, a World War II veteran, said he had standing to sue because one of the lieutenant governor’s duties is to serve as an advocate for veterans.Parson is poised to give more duties to the position, including moving oversight of the state arts council and public broadcasting programs. The House and Senate must sign off on the proposal.The court decision clarifies what had become a disagreement among legal experts and lawmakers on whether a Missouri governor has the power to fill the vacancy.Former Gov. Jay Nixon, a Democrat, sided with Parson, while former Missouri Supreme Court Chief Justice Michael Wolff, argued that there was no law authorizing the governor to appoint, nor the voters to elect, a person to serve as lieutenant governor to fill a vacancy in the office.In other words, once the lieutenant governor post is vacant, it would stay that way until the next election, Wolff said.But the court said a governor's authority to appoint a lieutenant governor is based on the state constitution, which says, ""The governor shall fill all vacancies in public offices unless otherwise provided by law.""In this case, there is no law providing guidance on the  issue, the court noted.
""Missouri’s constitution is clear regarding the authority to make gubernatorial appointments,"" Parson said in a statement. ""It’s important that Missouri have all of the statewide offices filled, which work to provide stability and to ensure that all Missourians are being served appropriately.""""The lieutenant governor is an important office for this state, and I applaud the Missouri Supreme Court’s decision today which confirms the position, as well as the position of previous governors from both parties, that the governor has the authority to appoint a lieutenant governor in the event of a vacancy,"" he said.Lauren Gepford, executive director of the Missouri Democratic Party, said the decision clears up a gray area in state law.
“This question needed to be addressed in the fallout from the explosive and brief tenure of Governor Eric Greitens. Governor Parson has won the power to appoint the state government of his choosing, which he has done by appointing his own Lieutenant Governor, Attorney General, and Treasurer. We look forward to holding him accountable for his own performance in office as well as the performance of his appointees,"" Gepford said.Judges George Draper and Patricia Breckenridge dissented from the majority.""While the Legislature may not have provided an alternative method of appointment, there is an alternative available to fill the vacancy — the position merely remains vacant until the next general election,"" Draper wrote.Democrats say there are numerous examples of the office being left vacant after its occupant has left or died dating to the 1820s.In 1960, for example, Lt. Gov. Edward Long was appointed to a seat in the U.S. Senate. His former office stayed vacant until 1961 when Hilary Bush was elected to the position.Kehoe, of Jefferson City, is a former Senate majority leader.""I applaud the Missouri Supreme Court's decision today affirming the governor's right to fill this office by appointment, and I look forward to continue to partner with him on economic development and infrastructure,"" Kehoe said.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Heading toward 2020, Parson's campaign haul tops $3 million","Apr 16, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/heading-toward-parson-s-campaign-haul-tops-million/article_d6ea6ffc-517d-5023-914c-43523f754928.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • More than a half million dollars poured into Gov. Mike Parson’s campaign fund during the first three months of 2019, signaling that the Republican is gearing up to run for a full term in 2020.Reports filed with the Missouri Ethics Commission show Parson raised $198,931 in his personal campaign account.Uniting Missouri, a separate political action committee not controlled by Parson, raised $354,156.

That left the governor and his allies with $3.4 million in cash, with nearly one-third of that coming from retired St. Louis financier Rex Sinquefield.Although Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft has been mentioned as a potential primary rival, fundraising numbers submitted by the Republican show he had $206,000 in his campaign account on April 1 after raising $95,700.Among Democrats potentially seeking the state’s top job, Sen. Scott Sifton of Affton reported having $313,000 on hand as of April 1. Auditor Nicole Galloway has $65,798 in her account after raising $114,194 in the first quarter. Neither has formally announced future political plans.
Parson, a former legislator, was elected lieutenant governor in 2016 and was elevated to governor June 1 following the resignation of scandal-plagued Eric Greitens.Parson has not made a formal announcement about his plans to run, but his fundraising activity suggests he’s preparing for a campaign.
At an event in Cape Girardeau in late March, for example, Parson collected $47,236 for his personal campaign account. Among the donors was former Lt. Gov. Peter Kinder, who wrote a check for $250.At a February event in Poplar Bluff, Republican Senate candidate Eddy Justice gave Parson $2,600. Former House Speaker Todd Richardson, who was named by Parson to a job overseeing the state’s Medicaid program, contributed $500. State Rep. Jeff Shawan, R-Poplar Bluff, gave Parson $2,600.Along with Sinquefield, Uniting Missouri received a number of contributions from businesses that have interests in legislation moving through the process in the Capitol, including transportation engineering firms and video gambling companies.Records show Parson paid $14,900 for airplane flights. He also spent $195 on Kansas City Chiefs apparel.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Messenger: The Missouri River is a 'mad elephant' that won't be tamed by 'bigger and better' levees,"Apr 15, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/columns/tony-messenger/messenger-the-missouri-river-is-a-mad-elephant-that-won/article_97a0da01-16a4-51d4-b72c-a0494f5963b2.html,"Every time Missouri River flood season gets serious, I take out “the box.”The sagging and slightly torn sides of the two-foot-long brown, cardboard container hold historic research that author and journalist Bill Lambrecht gathered in his many years writing about the eight-state river basin and its constant political battles over flooding, levees, navigation, agriculture, recreation and the environment.When Lambrecht, author of the book “Big Muddy Blues,” left the Post-Dispatch, he bequeathed the box to me. Every time I peruse its contents, I come across something I missed before.

This time it was a 1944 piece in Collier’s Magazine by author Kyle Crichton. Written after the horrific flood of 1943, which led to the policies that manage the Missouri River today, it offered a description of the river that has repeated itself over and over for decades, most recently in the Flood of 2019.“The Missouri is the mad elephant of rivers,” Crichton wrote. “Once a year and sometimes oftener it comes charging out of the mountains of Montana through the fertile Middle West in a roaring, insane torrent that overwhelms farms, railroads, towns and humans. Homeless families sleep in schoolhouses and churches until the water subsides and they can return to look at the ruin of their lives. Some manage to start over again; others surrender in the face of a disaster that seems to delight in repeating itself. The two floods of 1943 did damage estimated at 63 million dollars.“Army engineers perform prodigies in a technical battle they can never win. They widen channels, build jetties, construct dikes. But when the inevitable floods come, the massive jetties are crushed, the fertile lands along the river banks are denuded to fill the channels with silt and little towns bury their dead with the silent fatalism of habit.”That last phrase — the silent fatalism of habit — could describe the political reaction to Missouri River flooding virtually every year since 1943. That flood was similar to the one this year that already covered portions of South Dakota, Nebraska, Iowa, Kansas and Missouri in slow rising water fed by larger than normal snow melt. It came in waves, and round two is likely coming after the most recent April “bomb cyclone” dumped feet of snow in the Dakotas, Montana and Minnesota.Then, as now, policy makers thought they could tame the river by building bigger and better levees, more dams and other man-made structures.It’s never been so, writes David Stokes.Last week, Stokes, executive director of the Great Rivers Habitat Alliance, wrote letters to Missouri’s congressional delegation and Gov. Mike Parson, urging them to learn the lessons the river has been teaching us for decades.Parson met with other river basin governors to discuss flooding recently, and many of those governors, such as Gov. Pete Ricketts of Nebraska, are calling for “bigger and better” levees.
That’s precisely the wrong solution, Stokes wrote.“As we attempt to address the devastation caused by the flooding, it is imperative that we do not repeat the mistakes of the past,” Stokes wrote. “Calls to address the flood disaster by rebuilding levees even higher than they were previously and adding new levees onto our overly channelized river system are counterproductive and must be resisted. Massive spending on new dams and levees will make future floods even worse, not better.”In his letter, Stokes went further back in history to make his point, referencing a congressional report filed by an engineer named Charles Ellet in 1852. He was tasked by the War Department to study consistent flooding of the Mississippi River, particularly in the New Orleans area, as it was creating security and economic consequences for the nation.
Ellet called for “higher and stronger” levees in and around the most populated areas in the Delta, but with one huge caveat: the real key to flood control, he said, is to “reclaim the swamps,” to give the river multiple outlets and “relief valves.”In other words, give the river room to roam.That was the same conclusion Gen. Gerald Galloway of the Army Corps of Engineers reached 150 years later when he and a team of scientists studied the 1993 flood that devastated the Midwest in many of the same ways we are experiencing today. Stop developing in floodplains, the report said. Reclaim wetlands. As much as possible, return the river to its natural state, even if it means buying up farmland and shuttering entire river towns.Ellet was ignored. So was Galloway, mostly.Twenty-first century politicians appear to be poised to make the same mistakes their predecessors made, trying to tame the mad elephant out of fatalistic habit.Don’t do it, Stokes urges.“We look to you and your fellow Missouri elected officials to lead Missouri in a direction toward giving our great rivers room to spread, as nature intended them to do,” he wrote. “Attempting to address a disaster caused by floodplain development and river management with even more development and management will condemn our region to repeating these mistakes over and over.”

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri hopes to lasso national rodeo event with upgrades to state fairgrounds,"Apr 14, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-hopes-to-lasso-national-rodeo-event-with-upgrades-to/article_dd4e2e7b-6e81-54e2-a508-6b00ecbfd475.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Missouri Gov. Mike Parson wants to invest nearly $5 million in a project that might not have a payback until long after he’s left office.The governor, a Republican, is calling on lawmakers to set aside money to make upgrades to the 118-year-old Missouri State Fairgrounds in Sedalia, with a goal of luring the National High School Rodeo Finals to the facility.The finals, which can draw as many as 1,700 competitors and crowds estimated at 50,000, are already scheduled through 2029, meaning it could be more than a decade before Missouri could have an opportunity to serve as a host.

If Parson wins a full term in 2020, he will have been gone from office five years before any calves are roped or bulls ridden.The Missouri Department of Agriculture, however, says the investment would be worthwhile.“These upgrades would allow us to qualify not only for future rodeo events, but also other off-season events that may find Missouri as a well-positioned, central U.S. location,” Agriculture Department spokeswoman Sami Jo Freeman said.Just as past governors have had pet projects — then- Gov. Jay Nixon was an advocate for expanding the state park system — Parson’s push for the state fairgrounds comes as lawmakers are grappling with a $30 billion spending blueprint amid a slowdown in tax revenue.Although administration officials are hopeful that revenue will pick up before the end of the fiscal year on June 30, budget observers say the governor may have to withhold money to keep the state in the black.“If (withholdings) do happen, they are going to be very painful. It will likely be higher ed institutions that will face this,” said Rep. Kip Kendrick, D-Columbia, the ranking minority member of the House Budget Committee.For now, the money for the fairgrounds remains intact in the budget proposal moving through the House and the Senate.The high school rodeo finals are held over a 10-day span and include 13 rodeo specialties and two shooting competitions. Each state, as well as Canadian provinces and other countries, sends competitors to the event, which is held each year in mid-July.Along with bull riding, there are barrel racing, bareback riding and roping competitions.The event has rotated the past 11 years between the Wyoming communities of Gillette and Rock Springs. Lincoln, Neb., was selected to be a third location to host in July 2020 and July 2021.
Lincoln also was selected to host the event in 2026 and 2027.Other cities that have hosted the finals have upgraded their facilities in hopes of capitalizing on the money that could be generated by the added business. A University of Nebraska study estimated the economic impact of hosting the finals in Lincoln at $16.2 million annually.Tourism officials in Rock Springs put the economic impact at $7 million.In Missouri, the additional money would pay for a new 80-stall horse barn, 160 additional campground sites and a permanent pavilion that would replace a tent that costs about $30,000 to rent each year.Freeman said the current horse facilities didn’t meet the fair’s needs.
“To accommodate for overflow issues, temporary horse barns have been rented in recent years. Those rental costs exceed $15,000 for two months of tent rental,” she said.The proposed spending follows an unsuccessful bid for the rodeo finals last year. Missouri was turned down because of a shortfall in space.“Missouri would love to host the NHSRA as soon as possible and we will be bidding in the future as the Missouri State Fairgrounds is upgraded,” Freeman said. “The Missouri State Fair is home to many off-season events that drive the rural Sedalia economy throughout the year, and we’d love to add the rodeo to that list.”Sedalia, with a population of 21,500, is comparable in size to Rock Springs and Gillette. Lincoln’s population is over 280,000.Randy Conklin, who runs a cattle and horse operation in Fayette, Mo., is on the national site selection committee.He said the main reason Sedalia was turned down was the lack of space for the trade show that accompanies the rodeo.“If we had the facilities, the central location would be hard to beat,” Conklin said. “If they can get those upgrades, there would be a 90 percent chance they could get it.”For now, the rodeo is booked at the American Royal in Kansas City in 2029. But, Conklin said, if site improvements are not made there by 2021, the rodeo association has the ability to void the contract and look elsewhere.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,They're some of the most challenging and dangerous jobs in Missouri. And they start at $15 an hour.,"Apr 14, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/they-re-some-of-the-most-challenging-and-dangerous-jobs/article_1819aaac-c462-5836-8e4a-53441cef99d2.html,"BOWLING GREEN, Mo. • The first recruit showed up at boot camp an hour early, wearing a 2014 letter jacket to keep warm.Then two pals pulled into the icy parking lot together, also eager to become correctional officers. One of them, after a short stint in the Army, craved routine. The other had a daughter to support and felt lucky to have survived an infection that cut his weight to 365 pounds.Bethany Henson, 22, was a third his size. She arrived determined to confront her fear of abusive men for the opportunity to earn enough money to have her own home. Had she not been starting a criminal justice career this day, she said, she’d be looking for a lawyer.
“I want to show all these other single mothers out there who have had as much difficulty as I’ve had that they can do it,” said Henson, who has three children. “When I was younger, I didn’t feel like dreams mattered.”

In all, 46 people — ages 19 to 52 — started the four-week boot camp on March 4. Their backgrounds were diverse, but the reasons why they wanted to be on the front lines of the Missouri Department of Corrections were not.“Right now they need a job. That’s who is coming through the door,” said Jim Wiseman, head of training for the department, which has been hammered by turnover. “And doggone it, we need them.”Wiseman stood under the disco ball at the Pike County Fairgrounds, personally greeting each one of them. “Come on in, welcome,” he said. “You found us.”Under normal conditions, new recruits go to training academies in Jefferson City, Farmington or St. Joseph before being placed in one of the state’s 21 prisons. Staff departures have been so high at Northeast Correctional Center in Bowling Green — and the competition steep for the same jobs in Illinois and Iowa — that the medium-security prison needed a lifeboat of its own.

Shortages have depleted institutional knowledge statewide, while more and more officers quit. In 2018 alone, 1,262 correctional officers left, up from 823 in 2014. There were recently 776 openings for the lowest level of correctional officer, which has a full capacity of 4,773.

Though the state’s largest agency operates on a $786 million annual budget, its 11,000 employees are among the lowest paid in the nation. The average salary last year for correctional officers and jailers in Missouri was $31,650, according to the U.S. Department of Labor — well below both Iowa, $50,750, and Illinois, $62,440. Missouri Gov. Mike Parson, in his budget proposal, calls for pay raises that could be as much as 13 percent for some correctional officers, which officials say will help retention.But the job itself — being hemmed in by a “kill fence” with violent offenders — isn’t for everyone, no matter the pay. The so-called forgotten officers of law enforcement face a bruising cycle. Fewer hands and low morale cut into the quality of programs for the 30,000 inmates, which disrupts prison life and adds more stress for everyone.

It’s also increasingly more costly for taxpayers. In 2018 alone, the department spent $26 million on overtime, more than three times as much as in 2014.That doesn’t include a mountain of unused comp time and more than $113 million that a Cole County court awarded correctional officers in 2018 for unpaid work that they performed before and after their shifts.

A few officers said voluntary and mandatory overtime are nice for a while, but it’s gone on so long that workers get burned out by not seeing the families they’re trying to support. Some call in sick rather than wait to be relieved from a long shift.One correctional officer getting ready to quit said inmates know staff can be too tired to deal with them, which makes it easier to plant and pass around contraband, such as drugs and homemade tattoo guns, hooch and knives.All the while, those who are stepping up to get hired tend to be younger and less experienced. The minimum age has dropped to 19 from 21. A driver’s license is no longer required. Nor are the agility and problem-solving tests once used to screen applicants. About a third of new hires don’t make it through the first year, which Director Anne Precythe is trying to improve in part through the training program.In Bowling Green, Wiseman encouraged the new class of recruits to ask questions and not give up if they get discouraged. He also promised cookies and punch in a month at a graduation ceremony that their families could attend, an event that had fallen out of practice.“We got you in the door right now,” he told them. “You are employees. Don’t go anywhere, folks.”Biggest employerMany of the recruits were starting the highest paying job of their lives: A base salary of $30,000, or $15 an hour, and benefits.A lot of them came from eastern Pike County, along the Mississippi River, where the loss of industry 85 miles north of St. Louis has made the economic situation look “Third World,” said Chris Gamm, presiding county commissioner.“The Department of Corrections is by far the largest employer in the county,” he said.

Tracy Davis, 48, of Louisiana, Mo., said she’s gone through several jobs in recent years, including waitress, medication tech, and temp at the GM assembly plant. She liked the stability of the prison industry. “I’ve been trying to find something that pays well and has good benefits, so I ended up here,” Davis said.She’s a grandmother with five grown children — one boy, four girls. “It will be OK,” she said about the challenges of dealing with prisoners. “The inmates have nothing on my girls.”Lisa Maxey most recently earned $8.35 an hour at a gas station and didn’t want to say why that job ended.“Bowling Green really doesn’t have any options, to be honest,” she said. “There are a few gas stations and restaurants, and there’s Walmart. You never know when they are going to be hiring. It’s nice to go where they actually need you and you aren’t just expendable.”When she was in high school, she wanted to be a mortician or work in a psych ward. Now 27, with the driver’s license requirement lifted, she was excited to get a flavor of that at the corrections department. Her family was proud of her.“They said I have the mentality for it,” she said. “I can shut off my emotions in a heartbeat.”Austin Borders, 23, was originally from the southeast Missouri town of Doniphan, where he said he grew up working at sawmills and later ran out of opportunity. In Bowling Green, he’s washed dishes at a café and most recently earned $9.25 an hour at McDonald’s, which cut his shift in half over winter.“I can’t get my bills paid on that,” he said.He looked forward to steady paychecks and all the overtime they’d give him. He’d recently put $400 down on a $2,500 pickup and agreed to pay at least $150 a month. Now the transmission was going out and the truck needed other repairs.“My brakes are metal on metal,” he said.Keeping it professionalA few of them had experience working with inmates.Ashley Treiber, 29, formerly worked as a correctional officer for St. Charles County. She had a lot of informed responses to questions in class. She also had a long commute and a 2-year-old son. She arrived late after lunch on the first day of boot camp, in tears. She said her grandfather died over the weekend.“I am trying to make this work,” she said. “I am going to keep trying.”A 5-hour energy drink helped get her through the afternoon session on discrimination, harassment, retaliation and unprofessional conduct.Scott Phillips, of the Office of Professional Standards Civil Rights Unit, told them that professionalism was expected of every employee of the department and that they could set the tone of worksite culture.“We work for the public, the citizens of Missouri,” he told them. “It’s important that we give them a good reason to continue to fund us. If we are behaving badly, do you think they are going to want to fund us the way that we think we need?”While he didn’t need a fake example, he put up a sample story from the “The Daily News” to show possible publicity from doing the wrong thing, like bringing contraband into prison, having sex with offenders or harassing peers.That same afternoon, a headline ran in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch about the state paying $600,000 to a corrections department employee to settle a sexual harassment claim. Shown the story, Jessica Hays, 23, said she hadn’t heard about the case, nor numerous other payouts and reports exposing a culture of harassment and retaliation in Missouri’s prisons.

“They offer really good benefits. The pay is decent. I figured I might as well start something new I can build a career in,” said Hays. “I wanted to see what I am made of.”Other women in the class hadn’t heard about the scandal either.Phillips went through several scenarios to help notice improper behavior among staff and supervisors. For instance, what if a boss invites you out for beers to talk about a test?“Is that a request for sex?” Phillips asked.“Not yet,” said Treiber.Dealing with inmatesTwo weeks later, Angela Nickelson went through more scenarios to prepare the recruits for inmates with special needs and those who will try to manipulate them.“You are going to take a lot of verbal abuse,” she warned. “We don’t care, do we?”Nickelson, 49, made a career out of corrections. She said in an interview that when she was hired in 1994, she was one of the smallest correctional officers in the department — and likely the only one with a fresh college degree in elementary education.“The brain is the most powerful tool you can have here,” she said. “We are not all out there wrestling inmates every day.”

A year after being hired, she said, she was relieved to be assigned to a death row housing unit at Potosi Correctional Center. Compared to the general prison population, she said, they were laid back. One of them was serial killer Anthony Joe LaRette.
“He was pretty interesting,” she said. “Super friendly. Great personality, which is what you should be leery of.”She said people who work in corrections “aren’t like normal people.” She admitted that she has a potty mouth from working in the industry and prison lingo permeated her household. Instead of being grounded, her kids went to “administrative segregation” at home when they got in trouble.Inmates and low pay don’t seem to scare her. She didn’t discourage her son, a former heavyweight wrestler, from the career. In 2018, his first full year of employment with the department, he made $35,679, according to a state database. Mom, the veteran employee, made $41,382.She specializes in training correctional officers. “Nothing about our job is about punishment, it’s about rehabilitation and treating people as human beings,” she told the class, assuring: “How you present yourself is how you will be perceived.”Many inmates have disabilities such as dementia, schizophrenia and post-traumatic stress disorder.“Some don’t play well with others because of their mental illness,” she said. “Then they are locked up in a prison full of people they’d like to stay away from. They aren’t being rebellious. They don’t get it.”But inmates with antisocial personality disorder are some of the worst to look out for, she said, “(Even) if you have six kids, they will take you out and not care.”She went over how to notice and talk to inmates contemplating suicide. Before showing the recruits how to cut somebody down who tried to hang himself, she gave fair warning for the class exercise.Henson, the 22-year-old recruit with three kids, fled the room and missed hearing Nickelson say this:“When you walk in and see somebody hanging and you’ve never seen it, it’s pretty disturbing. You are going to see it a million more times in your head.”Reacting to violenceDefensive tactics seemed the most emotionally challenging to the class. One recruit, who’d impressed colleagues and instructors through coursework, broke down and cried while working on the mats. She said she’d been the victim of domestic violence.Another said she wasn’t comfortable having anybody even act like they were choking her. An older man in the class also struggled to learn various maneuvers.

Dan Wiley, an Army veteran with three lifesaver awards and another for valor from his work at Northeast Correctional Center, told recruits to breathe and keep trying until various techniques became muscle memory.“This is just practice for when the real thing happens,” he told them.Videos of real attacks weren’t shared at boot camp. Instead, they role-played attacking each other in slow motion with rubber knives and other devices.“Hand me your weapon,” one recruit said.“Why are you stabbing me?” asked another.
In late 2017, an offender at the prison used a homemade knife to stab a correctional officer in the back of the head and hand multiple times as she tried to flee Housing Unit No. 8. The unprovoked “hit and run” happened in about 10 seconds, maybe less, said Jeff Kaufman, a Bowling Green detective.“I am sure it seemed like hours to her,” he said.The injured officer was treated and released from the hospital and later testified that she had lingering injuries and mental anguish. She is still employed by the department. The trainee who was beside her at the time of the attack is not.Wiley was one of the first to respond. He saw the blood and heard the screams of what he said sounded like someone being murdered. He helped restrain the inmate who did it — Jeardin Hutchins, 31, of Bel-Ridge, who was in prison for robbing a Domino’s Pizza on Natural Bridge Road in 2011.Asked if the trainees were prepared to defend themselves, Wiley said: “Were you ready when your child was born? They are going to have to grow as officers before anybody is ready.”‘Part of our family’As promised, there were cookies and punch on Graduation Day. Out of the 46 who started boot camp, two dropped out, including one recruit who described himself on his social media page as a “professional napper.”The rest graduated, but four of them were on provisional status until they passed defensive tactics and shooting a 12-gauge shotgun. About a fourth of them had never fired a weapon.

“Wow! This is a big deal,” Wiseman, the training chief, said at the ceremony. “We do graduation ceremonies, and recognition ceremonies, but not this big.”He thanked the 150 people in attendance.“There are a lot of things that happen inside a prison that challenge employees, and they need the support of family and friends,” he said. “We can see, just from looking out here, that they have your support.”

Dan Redington, the new warden in Bowling Green, also offered congratulations. “We truly are looking forward to getting you back to our facility, making you part of our family,” he said.Twenty-five years ago, he said, he was sitting where they were. He thought being a correctional officer was going to be temporary.“Lo and behold, it got into my skin and I loved this environment,” he said. “I loved the people I am working with. I can truly say this job has been a blessing because it has taken care of my family, and it’s something I enjoy to do. So I hope that you all will feel the same way about this.”

After hearing many complaints as a Republican state representative from the area, Rep. Jim Hansen, vice chairman of the House Corrections Committee, said in a speech to the graduates that the department was moving in the right direction.“I am truly grateful for the work you are doing to keep our community safe, to help rehabilitate people,” he said. “That is the No. 1 mission, to get people back into society and be productive citizens. So I wish you the best.”That resonated with Stacey Strickland, 45, of Hannibal, whose daughter Ebony was among the graduates. Another daughter also works in the prison system.“If you can change one person — one individual — sometimes the flowers keep growing,” he said.Stacy Harrison said she was proud of her “headstrong and determined” daughter, Bethany Henson, for taking advantage of one of the biggest opportunities in the area. “It scares me a little bit, but I know the security there is something you can count on,” she said.Michael Davis, 20, of Louisiana, said he was proud of his mother, Tracy Davis — the grandmother with five children.“Over the last year and a half, she’s gone through so many jobs, it’s crazy,” he said.Always opportunitiesThe Northeast Correctional Center, built for 2,100 inmates, hunkers in a former cornfield between the Bowling Green water tower and a sewage treatment plant. A help-wanted sign on the edge of the property stays up all the time.After graduation, most of the new officers had two weeks of on-the-job training there. Armed with pepper spray, handcuffs, radios and rubber gloves, they were slowly introduced to the male inmate population by helping do roll calls and random pat-downs of people leaving the chow hall.“The prisoners don’t like us, but it’s bound to be like that anywhere we go,” said Sean Lambert, 20, who’d served in the Army.Tracy Davis didn’t used to give the prison much thought when she drove by it.“There’s people in here with real problems,” she said. “Some of these guys are 6-foot tall, or 7-foot tall.”Taller than her four daughters.“I want to go home at the end of the day, so I am going to treat them with respect if at all possible,” she said. “Then you have to stand your ground, too.”

That same day, a job fair kicked off under the disco ball over at the Pike County Fairgrounds, where the boot camp was temporarily held. One hundred job seekers signed in to walk the 30 booths.The corrections department had a basket of peppermints set out. One recruiter touted the ease of being a correctional officer, while another hyped the benefits — three weeks of paid vacation and three weeks of paid sick leave earned in the first year of employment; a dozen paid holidays; health, dental and death benefits; and the opportunity to serve in as soon as two weeks.Neal and Chelsea Breting wandered up to the dangling carrot. They were in limbo, staying with family, after a burst pipe damaged their home. Their 20-month-old daughter didn’t like to be set down long. Neal regretted working so many hours previously selling cars. They needed income.“Money is money at this point,” said Chelsea, 22, who applied.As the department was poised to gain an employee, it lost another.Treiber, who had previous jail experience in St. Charles County, quit Thursday, right before the training wheels came off for the rest of her boot camp peers. She said she landed a job closer to home as a police records clerk. It pays $52,000 — a 73 percent bump.

John McDonnell, the former chairman of McDonnell Douglas Corp., wrote a $300,000 check to Unite STL, which is the committee formed to help finance the Better Together merger campaign.

That follows a March contribution of $125,000 from a coalition of Carpenters Union locals in Missouri, Kansas and southern Illinois.The latest contribution is significant after retired financier Rex Sinquefield, who financed much of Better Together’s early work, had said he would not support the campaign if he were its only donor.It also is the first six-figure contribution following the announcement of a federal investigation into the administration of St. Louis County Executive Steve Stenger, who would have become the automatic mayor of the combined city under an earlier version of Better Together’s plan.Following news of the probe, Better Together inserted new language calling for an election to fill the post.
McDonnell, who retired as chairman of the aerospace company in 1997, has donated to both Republican and Democratic causes. In the 2016 election, he backed Democrat Chris Koster for governor and Republican Mike Parson for lieutenant governor. He also gave $1,500 to Sen. Bill Eigel, who is a member of a conservative bloc of senators in the Missouri Legislature’s upper chamber.
McDonnell also is listed as an early donor to the Better Together cause in 2018. Others at that time include Sinquefield, Civic Progress and the Regional Business Council.""We are very proud to have Mr. McDonnell's support,"" said Unite STL spokesman Ed Rhode.The money to Unite STL will help finance the plan to gather more than 160,000 signatures and place the merger question on the November 2020 statewide ballot.If approved, the merger would combine under one metro city the police departments, court systems, roadways, regional planning and zoning, and economic development arms of the city, county and the 88 county municipalities. County municipalities would become new political subdivisions, called “municipal districts,” with power over some services, such as parks and trash collection, but with otherwise severely restricted authority.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Messenger: 'Unsubstantiated' — the most painful word in military sexual assault complaints,"Apr 13, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/columns/tony-messenger/messenger-unsubstantiated-the-most-painful-word-in-military-sexual-assault/article_6e6ad40f-d960-5dd8-86f0-ac03061701b6.html,"Capt. Heather Sexton thought she was prepared for everything.When she filed a sexual assault complaint with the Missouri National Guard two years ago, she was prepared to be her own advocate.Sexton was prepared to push back her planned resignation to make sure the Guard investigated her complaint. She was prepared for a negative finding. From everything she had read and heard from other women in the military, sexual assault complaints rarely lead to any real discipline.

She was not prepared for what the report actually said.“The Investigative Team finds, by a preponderance of the evidence, that on or about 29 April 2017, there was physical contact between the reported perpetrator and victim involving the reported perpetrator grabbing the victim’s groin and breast and stomach,” reads the report prepared by the Army’s Office of Complex Investigations. “However, the Investigative Team found insufficient evidence to determine the reported perpetrator’s intent of the physical contact, thus, we were unable to establish that intentional sexual contact occurred.”The report, which she had to fight to get long after it had been filed, hit her “like a wall.”“I thought I was prepared for every scenario,” Sexton says. “I knew it was my word vs. his. I had mentally prepared for it to come back unsubstantiated. I hadn’t prepared for the report to actually say, yes, this happened to you, but it’s OK that it happened.”After 10 years in the Missouri Army National Guard, Sexton is no longer in active service. She and her husband live in west St. Louis County. She’s telling her story in part because of an email she received in March, shortly before she left the Guard.“Across the Total Army, we continue to focus on eradicating sexual harassment and sexual assault from our ranks,” wrote Gen. Mark Milley, Army chief of staff, and Secretary of the Army Mark Esper. It was an email sent to all senior Army leaders following years of criticism and congressional action seeking to force the military to take sexual assault more seriously. “We must do everything within our power to rid the Army of these crimes.”The letter points out that sexual assault reports in the Army are increasing, an indication that “soldiers trust their leaders to address the situation in a professional manner.”What good is that, Sexton wonders, if the reports validate women’s complaints but do nothing to punish predators?“The perpetrators are not being held accountable,” she wrote in an email to the two military leaders.The assaultSexton’s assault happened in Utah. She and her unit were at Camp Williams for training. The local Guard unit hosted them for a social event. Alcohol was served. Afterward, as had been her practice, she had a male soldier walk her back to the women’s barracks, which was down a long, dark, secluded sidewalk. She was the only woman in the unit at the training exercise.
She and the sergeant who walked her to the barracks engaged in a personal conversation about gender issues. He explained, according to the report, that he was “struggling” with questions of gender. “I felt he needed to talk,” Sexton says. The investigative report says he asked if he could “touch” her. She thought he was going to give her a hug.“He grabbed my vagina like a bowling ball and shook me back and forth,” she says. “I just kind of stood there in shock. I felt like I wasn’t even in my own body. He used my kindness as weakness.”The next day, Sexton says, she couldn’t stop crying. She visited with a chaplain, called her husband and flew home. Two days later she filed a report of her assault. She told her story over and over again to an ever-changing sexual assault response coordinator.Letter of concern
After the investigation determined that the sexual assault was “unsubstantiated” — even while finding that Sexton “did not consent to a violent touching” — every member of the unit, including Sexton, received a “letter of concern” from Gen. David Boyle, the Joint Task Force Commander of the Missouri National Guard for violating the Guard’s alcohol and “fraternization” policies.“I hope going forward you will exercise better judgment and comport yourself appropriately,” Boyle wrote.The letter, and the lack of action taken against Sexton’s perpetrator, spurred a strong response from her special victims’ counsel to Gen. Stephen Danner, the adjutant general of the Missouri Guard.That letter takes issue with the legal conclusions in the investigative report, calling them “improper and unsupported by findings of fact.” It urges Danner to punish the perpetrator. “This intentional act violated Capt. Sexton’s reasonable expectation to be treated with dignity and respect while serving her country and state, and amounts to serious misconduct that should be addressed appropriately,” Sexton’s counsel wrote to Danner.The letter, apparently, fell on deaf ears.Sexton says Danner did not punish the accused.The National Guard Bureau, through a spokeswoman, declined to discuss the investigation. So did the Missouri National Guard.“Per legal counsel, both Maj. Gen. Danner and the Missouri National Guard are legally prohibited from commenting on administrative actions,” Maj. John Quin wrote in an email. “The Missouri National Guard takes all reports of sexual assault and harassment seriously.”Sexton believes her experience belies that last statement. She has sent letters to Gov. Mike Parson, Missouri U.S. Sens. Josh Hawley and Roy Blunt, and U.S. Rep. Ann Wagner, alerting them to the results of her investigation. She’s speaking out, she says, because her military training as an officer taught her to stand up for others.“I’m an officer, and this happened to me,” Sexton says. “What happens when a private gets sexually assaulted? I felt a strong responsibility as a leader to make sure this doesn’t happen to other women.”

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Editorial: Get ready for return of elected-board rule over St. Louis Public Schools,"Apr 11, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-get-ready-for-return-of-elected-board-rule-over/article_3aecdfb5-758a-5158-a727-352ead1ff1af.html,"Missouri’s State Board of Education meets in St. Louis on Monday and Tuesday for a specific purpose: to decide on restoring the elected school board to power. All indications are that approval will be granted, meaning that the Special Administrative Board’s exclusive, 12-year rule will likely end on July 1.The business and political communities around St. Louis are squeamish, including at least two of the three politicians — Gov. Mike Parson, St. Louis Mayor Lyda Krewson and Board of Aldermen President Louis Reed — responsible for nominating SAB members. This newspaper has long expressed its own doubts about the elected board’s ability to maintain the SAB’s steady track record toward improvement and financial stability without reverting to the kinds of infighting, micromanagement and politicking that led to state intervention in 2007.Suffice it to say that skeptics abound, which means the seven-member elected board will have a lot to prove. But the skeptics must face reality: The SAB has completed its assigned mission of restoring the school system to financial health and full accreditation. The justification no longer exists to continue holding the elected board at bay, powerless. It’s time for a handover and restoration of democratic rule.

“I’ve watched the members of this elected board work very hard to prepare,” says SAB president Rick Sullivan. “They are pursuing every type of preparation they can.”
It’s clear from the elected board’s composition, especially with the addition of newly elected members Tracee Miller and Adam Layne, that the teacher’s union and national organization Teach for America will wield heavy political influence over decision-making. If past is prologue, St. Louisans should expect a return of backroom wheeling and dealing by major contractors and lobbyists.The district still struggles with high teacher turnover. Most students still fail state tests. Enrollment continues to drop. But the elected board has undergone months of intensive training with the Missouri School Board Association to learn how to cope with such challenges.
Superintendent Kelvin Adams has brought progress in large part because of his collaborative working relationship with the three-member SAB. Collaboration could easily turn to confrontation with politicians now overseeing him. St. Louis parents and voters must not allow the elected board to chase Adams away with meddling and micromanaging tendencies. Leaders of his caliber will not come to St. Louis if it regains a reputation as a superintendent’s hellhole.The elected board must accept that it will be operating under a microscope of intense skepticism and scrutiny. The board deserves a chance to prove itself, but the public must not let down its guard. Elected members will have to earn the public’s respect, which will come only through good governance, sound financial management and political restraint — and always with the singular goal of building solid futures for the system’s 21,000 students."
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri Senate reaches 'breakthrough' agreement on road and bridge repairs,"Apr 11, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-senate-reaches-breakthrough-agreement-on-road-and-bridge-repairs/article_7b51f5b7-7acb-5c20-a27e-354493546fb3.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • The leader of the Missouri Senate said Thursday that lawmakers had reached a “breakthrough” in negotiations over a multimillion-dollar plan to boost infrastructure spending in the state.The compromise — developed between Senate GOP leadership and members of the Senate Conservative Caucus — was reached after days of negotiations among the two Republican factions, House leadership and Gov. Mike Parson’s office.Parson, a Republican, has made funding bridge projects a priority this legislative session after voters in November rejected an increase to the state’s fuel tax to pay for repairs. But progress on Parson’s proposal had slowed amid debate among Republican lawmakers.

Members of the conservative bloc filibustered a revised proposal, brought by Senate President Pro Tem Dave Schatz, R-Sullivan, from Tuesday afternoon until after 2 a.m. Wednesday.On Thursday, the chamber aired a compromise resolution that authorizes the Missouri Department of Transportation to issue bonds totaling $301 million that would go toward bridge repairs.“This substitute is the result of extensive conversations with several senators, and I want to thank them for working with us on this,” Schatz said Thursday, later describing the agreement as a “breakthrough.”The Senate Fiscal Review Committee still must give its approval to the measure before it comes before the chamber for a final vote, which Schatz said would occur Monday.Schatz said the bonding would begin in fiscal 2021 and that the money would be paid back over seven years. He said the state would have to appropriate about $46.1 million per year to pay back the loan, and would ultimately pay $22.6 million in interest over the seven-year period.The proposal also would devote $50 million in general revenue next fiscal year to “jump-start” the governor’s bridge replacement program, Schatz said. An additional $35 million would go toward a cost-share program for infrastructure improvements with counties and cities.The proposal is the latest infrastructure plan to surface since last year.Voters rejected a gradual 10-cent increase to the state’s gasoline tax last November, which was put on the ballot by the Legislature.After the defeat, Parson in January proposed issuing $350 million of bonds to pay for repairs to 200-plus bridges across the state.The House dumped that plan, instead voting last month to devote $100 million of general revenue to projects.The current proposal incorporates elements of both plans.Critics of Parson’s bonding proposal worried about the cost of borrowing: The state would be on the hook for about $100 million in interest payments over 15 years.
The Senate version requires the state to repay the loan over seven years, saving tens of millions of dollars in interest costs.It also allows the state to issue the bonds only if the state wins a federal infrastructure grant. One grant application seeks money to replace the Interstate 70 bridge in Rocheport; another application seeks money for bridge repairs.Officials have said the state is more likely to win federal money if it commits some of its own resources to the repairs. Parson has said that if the state devotes money toward the bridge repairs, it would free up more funds for road repairs.While the infusion of state and federal money would be a catalyst to repair long-term assets, the spending would not erase the state’s infrastructure backlog.Missouri Department of Transportation Director Patrick McKenna called it a “good day.”
“It’s a really hard thing to do right after a public rejection in November to come back with an attempt to start putting a down payment on some of the infrastructure needs we have,” McKenna said.“I appreciate the collaborative efforts by the Senate and the House on this shared priority and am encouraged by the important step taken today to get an infrastructure plan on my desk,” Parson said in a statement.“While our preference would be for an approach that does not put the fate of long overdue bridge repairs in the hands of Washington, D.C., we certainly understand that any proposed plan requires compromise to reach a workable solution,” he said.The chairman of the House Budget Committee, Rep. Cody Smith, said he was encouraged by the Senate’s proposal.“I do think we are closer. This is somewhat in the middle,” said Smith, R-Carthage.House Speaker Elijah Haahr, R-Springfield, credited Parson for pushing for a solution and for the Senate compromise.“I am pleased the Senate defined its intent to maximize potential federal grants and I am optimistic the final Senate budget maintains the responsible spending plan the House proposed,” Haahr said.But, Rep. Kip Kendrick, D-Columbia, said he’s concerned that an economic downturn could result in the state having to take money from education or social service programs to pay off the loan.“I’m not trying to sound like an alarmist here, but I see a very real scenario where there will be a downturn and in order to pay that debt back, you’re going to be cutting K-12 education,” said Kendrick, the top minority member on the House Budget Committee.The legislation is Senate Concurrent Resolution 14.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Editorial: What's really more important — tourism dollars or education?,"Apr 10, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-what-s-really-more-important-tourism-dollars-or-education/article_cbf9f6e9-aa16-5125-bfa6-594d32960a0e.html,"In yet another nose-thumbing gesture minimizing the importance of public education, Republican Rep. Jeff Knight has convinced the Missouri House that tourism dollars are what really matters when it comes to teaching kids in classrooms. The House has narrowly approved a bill limiting the starting date for classes to no earlier than 14 days before the first Monday in September.Knight, of Lebanon, is worried that an earlier start for classes would negatively affect Missouri tourism and the dollars it brings in for entertainment venues, hotels, restaurants and resorts. The fear is that if parents are concerned about getting their kids back home in time for a mid-August start of classes, they would likely be more inclined to limit their vacation plans. Businesses that cater to vacationers could see their profit margins decline as a result.

Well, that’s just terrible. But more terrible is the fact that Knight gives higher priority to those business profits than to the kind of educational rigor that helps boost student performance levels to meet Gov. Mike Parson’s priority of developing a skilled Missouri workforce. Extra terrible is that Knight convinced his colleagues to advance his bill, H.B. 161, to the Senate, where hopefully it will be received with a healthy dose of skepticism.The bill would not take effect until the 2020-21 school year. In 2020, 14 days before the first Monday in September would mean classes could not start until Aug. 24. That would be a full seven school days later than the scheduled start of public school classes in St. Louis this year, on Aug. 13. If school boards decide they still need those extra days in August, the bill would require them to hold a public meeting and board vote beforehand.

Sadly, Knight’s bill has less to do with education than with tourism profits. As the Post-Dispatch’s Kurt Erickson reported, Knight’s bill was supported by amusement park operators and lobbying groups for hotel and outdoor recreation operators.Yes, tourism is important. And yes, there is a therapeutic benefit to giving kids a long summer break from the rigors of academia. But Knight misses the point. By law, Missouri public schools must be in session for a minimum of 1,044 hours each year, which typically requires about 174 days of classroom instruction. When inclement weather forces school closures, missed days must be made up. If Knight’s bill succeeded in delaying the start of classes in August, the result would be shorter Christmas vacations and more days added at the start of summer vacation to comply with minimum requirements.Republicans who so strenuously tout the merits of school choice should take a moment to study the academic calendars of the state’s highest-performing charter schools. Those programs place strong emphasis on shorter summer breaks to keep students focused on what really matters: education."
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Transportation funding plan gets bumpy rollout in Missouri Senate,"Apr 10, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/transportation-funding-plan-gets-bumpy-rollout-in-missouri-senate/article_dd7f6efd-f39a-51f0-b290-87ee3fd8264a.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Missouri lawmakers attempted to take a new transportation funding scheme for a test drive Tuesday, but the plan quickly ran into gridlock in the hallways of the Capitol.In the Senate, opponents of a plan to borrow $351 million for roads and bridges worked to put the brakes on the measure. And, down the corridor, the chairman of the House Budget Committee expressed skepticism about the borrowing plan, but pledged to try to work out a compromise.“I do know this is a collaborate process. We will have a series of negotiations,” Rep. Cody Smith said.

Three months after Gov. Mike Parson announced a proposal to borrow $351 million to repair bridges across the state, Senate President Pro Tem Dave Schatz, R-Sullivan, proposed a new version designed to tamp down opposition to borrowing.Rather than spreading the cost over 15 years, the new version would repay the loan over seven years, potentially saving tens of millions of dollars in interest costs.Parson floated the outlines of the plan in January in response to the failure of a ballot initiative in November that sought to raise the state’s 17-cent-per-gallon gas tax by 10 cents.But, members of the House balked at the notion of borrowing and instead approved a budget that would earmark $100 million in general revenue for road building.Schatz’s new proposal, which is designed to strike a middle ground in terms of borrowing and general tax dollars, was formally introduced on the floor of the Senate after the $100 million House allocation was cut from the budget during an earlier budget hearing.The maneuvering signals that Senate leaders and Parson are on the same page when it comes to transportation funding heading into the final month of the legislative session.“I think this was a reasonable position to move back to. From a business perspective, I think it makes sense,” Schatz said.But, some members of the Senate and leaders in the House are signaling that more negotiations are necessary.“I still remain concerned about taking on additional debt. I’m going to be very hesitant to embrace a package that would incur unnecessary debt,” said Smith, R-Carthage.
Sen. Bill Eigel, R-Weldon Spring, said he likes the House approach.“My preference is for the $100 million,” Eigel said.“I think the House is taking the fiscally responsible approach,” added Sen. Bob Onder, R-Lake Saint Louis.Sen. Cindy O’Laughlin, R-Shelbina, said the borrowing plan is an “end around the taxpayer.”
Democratic lawmakers said the fissures among Republicans at the state and federal level don’t bode well for fixing the state’s roads and bridges.“We have an infrastructure problem and we cannot continue to kick the bucket down the road,” said Sen. Jamilah Nasheed, D-St. Louis. “We have to fend for ourselves.”Schatz has argued that if the state doesn’t issue bonds, it could jeopardize the state’s ability to qualify for a federal grant that will pay for the replacement of the Rocheport bridge on Interstate 70, which moves freight and travelers over the Missouri River in central Missouri.The Senate version of the budget also contains $15.8 million for repairs to flood damaged roads and bridges.“I know of at least one bridge that will need to be replaced,” said Sen. Dan Hegeman, R-Cosby and chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee.A debate on the borrowing plan was underway in the Senate Tuesday night. It was not clear whether a final vote would be taken.The legislation is Senate Concurrent Resolution 14.

LOUIS • A man who died after being shot in the face twice Saturday afternoon was identified by police on Tuesday.Leon Smith II, 33, was shot about 3:35 p.m. Saturday after a confrontation in an alley that started when the shooter wouldn’t move his car, police said. The alley is near the 3900 block of North 20th Street, police said.

Police found Smith, who lived nearby in the 3800 block of North Florissant Avenue, in the alley next to his vehicle. He was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead.The shooting prompted Alderman Brandon Bosley of the 3rd Ward to call for the Missouri National Guard to be sent to St. Louis.

“I’m done waiting,” Bosley said. “Before it gets too bad, we need to do something measurable. Extra hands. Extra guns. Guns bigger than the ones on the street.”On Monday, a spokesman for Gov. Mike Parson issued a statement in response to the call.“It’s certainly sad anytime someone is tragically affected by crime,” Steele Shippy, Parson’s communications director, said in a statement. “While we understand the challenges, we are committed to working with local officials and jurisdictions all across Missouri on practical solutions to reduce crime.”
Police Lt. Ken Lammert said a man in a silver SUV later identified as Smith was driving down an alleyway but had to stop when he saw a black SUV blocking the alley exit. Smith honked, then yelled out his window, asking the man if he was going to move his vehicle.The man declined, and both men got out of their vehicles. Lammert didn’t know exactly what happened next, but the man in the black vehicle soon fired six or seven shots through the front of Smith’s SUV, striking the Smith two or three times, Lammert said. The gunman sped off. The address is in the Hyde Park neighborhood.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Judge says Josh Hawley won't have to give deposition in open records dispute,"Apr 9, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/judge-says-josh-hawley-won-t-have-to-give-deposition/article_fe90b0c5-040d-5f03-a639-502cbcb38f14.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • A Cole County judge said Tuesday that U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley will not have to sit for a deposition amid an open records dispute between the state and a Democrat running for attorney general.Circuit Judge Patricia Joyce issued an order Tuesday quashing a subpoena by Elad Gross, a Democrat running for Missouri attorney general.Agents for Gross had served Hawley, a Republican, a subpoena last month following Hawley's speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington. 

The subpoena stemmed from an open records dispute Gross has with Gov. Mike Parson's administration. Gross is seeking a cache of documents from Parson’s office related to former Gov. Eric Greitens, but the governor’s office won’t turn the documents over unless Gross signs a $3,600 check.Gross filed a complaint with the Missouri attorney general’s office last fall, but the  office took no action against the governor. Hawley, who at the time was attorney general, won election to the U.S. Senate in November.
Gross said he subpoenaed Hawley instead of the attorney general's office because Hawley had personal knowledge of the information he sought. In a court brief, Hawley's attorneys moved to quash the subpoena. 
Kelli Ford, who works in Hawley's U.S. Senate office, issued a statement after Joyce's ruling:“Of course this is how the court ruled,"" she said. ""As we have said all along, this was just the latest political stunt by a Democrat candidate trying to get a headline by attacking Josh Hawley. Another swing and a miss.” Gross said after the ruling that he hopes Hawley will sit down voluntarily to tell him what he knows about ""dark money in the state.""

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,New road and bridge funding plan surfaces in Missouri Senate,"Apr 8, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/new-road-and-bridge-funding-plan-surfaces-in-missouri-senate/article_4f453f99-6e07-5df8-8dea-c3c972a22cdc.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • A new plan to boost spending on roads and bridges in Missouri is expected to surface as early as Tuesday as Gov. Mike Parson and legislative leaders work to find a transportation solution after voters turned down a gas tax hike in November.Without the added revenue from a 10-cent per gallon, phased-in gasoline tax increase, Parson asked lawmakers to allow him to borrow $350 million to repair 200-plus bridges, including three in the St. Louis region.The Republican-controlled House balked at the borrowing plan and instead approved a budget that earmarks $100 million out of the state’s general checkbook for additional road construction.

Now, Senate leaders are expected to outline a middle ground with a combination of new spending and a shorter borrowing window.With a Senate committee scheduled to take up the House budget for the first time on Tuesday, the Post-Dispatch has learned that Senate President Pro Tem Dave Schatz, R-Sullivan, is expected to introduce changes designed to give both sides some of what they are seeking.Instead of a $100 million outlay, the new money would amount to an estimated $56 million. That would be combined with $350 million in borrowing, but with a shorter payback period.“We’re looking at somewhere between what the House has presented and potentially something less than that,” Schatz said earlier.The new plan could assuage fears by Democrats that the $100 million plan advanced in the House budget would take money away from education, social service programs and public defenders.But, Schatz’s proposal will need the support of leaders in the Republican-controlled House.Rep. Cody Smith, R-Carthage, who is chairman of the House Budget Committee, earlier said he was “absolutely” ready to seek a compromise with the Senate.
“We have an open dialogue,” Smith told reporters after the House budget was approved.His primary concern with the governor’s plan was the cost of borrowing the money and spreading that cost over 15 years.“I’m very concerned about taking on additional debt and managing the size of that debt going forward,” Smith said. “I think there is opportunity to land somewhere in the middle.”Among Schatz’s concern is that the House plan could result in the state not having enough money to qualify for a federal grant that will pay for the repair of the Rocheport bridge on Interstate 70, which moves freight and travelers over the Missouri River.
Smith signaled that it’s a concern for him too.“I don’t think anybody in the Missouri General Assembly is interested in leaving tens of millions of dollars in federal funds for bridge repair on the table,” Smith said.The scramble to find a way to pay for road and bridge construction follows voters’ rejection of a proposed gasoline tax increase last November. Schatz had sponsored the ballot initiative and Parson traversed the state calling on voters to back the plan.Missouri’s 17-cent-per-gallon gas tax is among the lowest in the nation.The latest proposal comes as state budget revenues remain under estimates. The latest report shows revenue down $177 million, or 2.6 percent, from last year. The current year’s budget was built on a projection of 1.7 percent growth, meaning Parson may have to withhold spending if more money doesn’t flow into the state bank account.Lawmakers are scheduled to be in session until May 17.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Could National Guard help end violence in St. Louis? Alderman calls for help after daytime shooting,"Apr 8, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/could-national-guard-help-end-violence-in-st-louis-alderman/article_71696621-fc81-57a7-ba83-52a1143f6463.html,"ST. LOUIS • A man was shot in the face twice and left on the edge of death Saturday afternoon after an alleyway confrontation that started when the shooter wouldn’t move his car, police said.The boldness of the crime, on a sunny spring day as sports fans flocked downtown, just three miles south, led the neighborhood’s alderman to call for deployment of the Missouri National Guard before the summer hits and crime spikes.“I’m done waiting,” said Alderman Brandon Bosley of the 3rd Ward. “Before it gets too bad, we need to do something measurable. Extra hands. Extra guns. Guns bigger than the ones on the street.”















St. Louis Alderman Brandon Bosley, Ward 3, shares his disapproval of Better Together's plan to merge St. Louis County and city at a town hall meeting hosted by Senator Jamilah Nasheed on Feb. 11, 2019, at the Emerson Performance Center at Harris-Stowe State University.

Bosley said he and the city Board of Aldermen’s black caucus had been talking for weeks about petitioning Gov. Mike Parson. He said he hoped to persuade the board to pass a resolution calling on Parson to send troops to the worst city neighborhoods.“We’re going to have tanks on every damn corner,” Bosley said. “These people have to know we’re not playing anymore.”The call for state help would not be entirely without precedent. Then-Gov. Jay Nixon declared a state of emergency in 2014 and activated the Missouri National Guard in anticipation of a grand jury announcement regarding the fatal shooting in Ferguson of 18-year-old Michael Brown.And then-Gov. Eric Greitens, in 2017, sent the Missouri Highway Patrol to police St. Louis interstates, hoping to free city officers to focus on troubled neighborhoods. At times, troopers even backed up city police on calls.Still, the deployment of Guard troops for the day-to-day policing of city streets in St. Louis would be very unusual, if not unprecedented.Parson could not immediately be reached for comment.St. Louis Mayor Lyda Krewson declined to address Bosley’s plea. But she called the shooting tragic and said she was sad for the victim and his family.
“Guns are too often used to settle differences,” Krewson said in a statement.Police were called to the Saturday shooting just after 3:30 p.m.Police Lt. Ken Lammert said a man in a silver SUV was driving down an alleyway between North Florissant Avenue and the 3900 block of North 21st Street, but had to stop when he saw a black car blocking the alley exit.
The SUV driver, whom police did not identify, honked, then yelled out his window, asking the man if he was going to move his vehicle.The man declined, and both men got out of their cars. Lammert didn’t know exactly what happened next, but the man in the black vehicle soon fired six or seven shots through the front of the victim's SUV, Lammert said, striking the victim two or three times. The gunman sped away north on 21st.The address is in the Hyde Park neighborhood.The SUV driver was alive when he was loaded into the ambulance, Lammert said, but just barely. The man later died.A neighbor, Donald Kenny, 50, said he saw a black Audi with tinted windows drive away.“All they do is shoot,” Kenny said. “You can’t even go take your trash out without thinking about getting shot.”• Get crime reports for the St. Louis region• Map: St. Louis-area homicides in 2019

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"In Missouri, more partisan sniping over controversial tax changes","Apr 6, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/in-missouri-more-partisan-sniping-over-controversial-tax-changes/article_b7647385-3c3a-55ea-9c96-41b982b6154a.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Republicans are pushing back on Auditor Nicole Galloway’s claim that Gov. Mike Parson’s administration acted unlawfully when it quietly adjusted income tax withholding tables in January.Galloway said in an audit Tuesday that the Republican administration didn’t follow rule-making procedures, as prescribed by law, when officials changed the state’s tax withholding formula in January.But Republicans said later that previous changes to the withholding formula — under earlier administrations — also were not enacted under the procedures Galloway cited. Galloway made no mention of that fact, Treasurer Scott Fitzpatrick, a Republican, said this week.

State law says withholding changes must be made through the rule-making process. The regulation on the books is 26 years old, however, meaning withholding changes made since also did not follow state law, Fitzpatrick said.“The regulation has been outdated for 26 years. You would have thought that an auditor or the Department of Revenue would have identified that,” he told the Post-Dispatch Friday.The audit came after months of bipartisan criticism of the Department of Revenue for a lack of communication with taxpayers following previous changes to the tax tables that were made in response to federal tax cuts approved in 2017.As a result, people who did not adjust their 2018 withholding are getting smaller refunds or owe money.The dust-up led to the resignation of Revenue Director Joel Walters, who had been brought on board by former Gov. Eric Greitens.
Parson has tried to rebuff the criticism by calling it political grandstanding. In response to the audit, he asked Fitzpatrick to conduct his own review of the changes made by Revenue officials.In a three-page response obtained by the Post-Dispatch, Fitzpatrick agreed with Galloway about the actions taken and not taken by the Department of Revenue, but said that he doesn’t believe the department broke any law because it was trying to fix something that had been broken for more than a quarter century.
“Had the department implemented the withholding instructions pursuant to this antiquated regulations, the result would have been incompatible with current tax law and would have resulted in substantial under withholding,” Fitzpatrick wrote.The treasurer’s response was distributed to members of the Legislature on Thursday.House Minority Leader Crystal Quade, D-Springfield, sided with Galloway Friday, saying state law requires the state agencies to follow certain processes when altering rules and regulations.“That process was not followed and no amount of rationalization by the Treasurer or the rest of the administration will change that,” Quade said. “If it hopes to restore its credibility, the administration must own up to its failures and take its duty to taxpayers seriously.”In a statement Friday, Galloway said, “The State Treasurer agrees: the Department of Revenue is over withholding taxes from Missourians’ paychecks and ignored the legal process. It’s further bipartisan acknowledgement that there are ongoing issues affecting taxpayers. The administration needs to follow the law, get it right and stop misleading taxpayers.”

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Sinquefield lunches with Parson at governor's mansion,"Apr 4, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/sinquefield-lunches-with-parson-at-governor-s-mansion/article_a3fcef63-d2cc-57b1-8d45-de305111cd2f.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • The man who financed much of the early work behind a campaign to merge St. Louis and St. Louis County lunched with Gov. Mike Parson at the governor’s mansion Thursday.But, whether the two talked about the controversial effort to transform the region into a mega city was unclear in the aftermath of the meeting, which included a seat at the table for economist Art Laffer, who is considered the architect of a tax cut scheme in Kansas that left that state’s revenues in tatters.“The governor and I had a productive lunch conversation about the future economic growth needs of a state we both dearly love,” Rex Sinquefield said in a statement provided to the Post-Dispatch by a spokesman.

The lunch, first reported by the Kansas City Star, comes as the Republican governor has not taken a firm position on the Sinquefield-financed Better Together proposal, a campaign to get voter approval of a plan to fuse the city and the county.Municipal mayors in the county have expressed strong opposition to the idea, which Sinquefield has said would accelerate growth in the state.Lawmakers this week presented a number of bills that would leave the decision to voters in the county and city, as opposed to the entire state.
Sinquefield, a wealthy retired financier, backed Parson’s opponent in the 2016 primary election for lieutenant governor, but has since contributed $1 million to a political action committee formed to support Parson in a run for governor in 2020.Parson took over as chief executive in June after the resignation of former Gov. Eric Greitens.
Laffer is considered the architect of a 2012 tax cut package in Kansas that was supposed to trigger economic growth that would make up for the loss in revenue.The plan was dumped five years later after significant drops in revenues affected state aid to schools and universities and health care spending.Parson has not called for tax cuts in his budget proposal and is facing the prospect having to withhold funding for programs due to the impact of budget cuts enacted in 2014. Despite the lagging revenue, some GOP lawmakers continue to press for reductions as the legislative session enters its final weeks.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Out with the old: St. Charles, East St. Louis and Fenton all dump their mayors","Apr 3, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/out-with-the-old-st-charles-east-st-louis-and/article_d809018e-6ab8-52f2-8c6e-5388b7d5f418.html,"Voters in two cities on opposite ends of the metro area — St. Charles and East St. Louis — dumped their mayors Tuesday.In St. Charles, retired business executive Dan Borgmeyer defeated two-term Mayor Sally Faith with more than 55 percent of the vote.In East St. Louis, City Councilman Robert Eastern III, 48, beat 44-year-old incumbent Emeka Jackson-Hicks, 49.7 percent to 31.9 percent.

Trailing in the four-way race were former Mayor Carl Officer and Darnell Thompson, with 16.7 percent and 1.7 percent, respectively.In other mayoral races across the metro area:• Florissant Police Chief Tim Lowery was elected mayor of his north St. Louis County city, rolling up more than three-fourths of the vote over opponent Robert Parson Jr.• Write-in candidate Buddy Russell was overwhelmingly chosen Tuesday as the next mayor of Hillsboro.Russell, a retired welder and community volunteer, mustered 71 percent of the vote; Marcy Wokurka got 18 percent; and former Mayor Dennis Bradley received 9 percent.""As a write-in, I had to hit the road and knock on people's doors to have a chance,"" Russell said Tuesday night.He said voters were receptive to his pledge ""to bring back respect to the city"" after a year of political turmoil, which featured Bradley and another mayor resigning and a probe of the city's police department.• Alderman Bob Brasses toppled Fenton Mayor Josh Voyles. Brasses had criticized Voyles for allegedly misleading police investigating a hit-and-run he later admitted to. Voyles, who has apologized, wasn’t charged in the case.• Former Democratic state Rep. Tommie Pierson Sr., was chosen over two opponents as the next mayor of Bellefontaine Neighbors, succeeding the retiring incumbent.But another former Democratic state lawmaker, John Bowman, lost his bid to become mayor of Northwoods, losing to 16-year incumbent Everett Thomas. Bowman finished third, with Alderman Marvalda Jones coming in second.• Norman McCourt of Black Jack and Michael George Corcoran of St. Ann were among the incumbent mayors re-elected Tuesday. McCourt has held the office since 1998 and Corcoran has been mayor since 2011.Among other area mayors re-elected in contested races Tuesday were John Miller of Collinsville, Yolanda Austin of Jennings, Terry Epps of Pine Lawn and Mark Chamberlain of Charlack.• In the Frontenac mayoral race, final unofficial returns showed Kate Hatfield, a health care administrator, beating former Alderman Mike Schoedel by only five votes out of 880 cast. The incumbent didn't seek another term.But that wasn't as close as Wildwood's 1st Ward City Council race between Larry Brost and David Hudson. That ended in a tie, 286 to 286, according to final unofficial returns.Eric Fey, a St. Louis County Election Board official, said the result potentially could change if any military or other overseas ballots cast by a Ward 1 resident postmarked by Tuesday arrive in the mail in the next few days.But if the totals stay the same in the official certified count, Fey said, state law says the candidates can either get a runoff election or decide the outcome by a coin flip or a similar method.
In St. Charles, Borgmeyer, the retired head of a marketing company, and Faith, the mayor, had argued in their campaign over whether the city was on the right track in economic development.Borgmeyer, 72, had complained that St. Charles has fallen behind nearby cities such as St. Peters and O’Fallon in attracting jobs-producing development and that he would be more aggressive in that regard.Faith, 73, disputed that and pointed to projects such as the Streets of St. Charles mixed-use development and the planned expansion of the St. Charles Convention Center.In Florissant, Lowery, 54, is following the career path of his late father, Robert Lowery, who was the city’s police chief for 22 years and mayor for 10.His opponent, Councilman Robert Parson Jr., 48, was attempting to become the city’s first African-American mayor.
Lowery had a huge campaign fundraising lead, pulling in more than $115,000. Parson’s total was less than $9,000. Lowery also had the support of incumbent Mayor Tom Schneider, who didn’t seek another term.Lowery said he’d try to attract more businesses and young families to the city and ask the City Council to make the Florissant’s part-time economic development director full-time.Parson had said his council experience and work as a lawyer is more conducive to being an elected official than Lowery’s police background.Florissant write-inA write-in campaign to elect Mary Elizabeth Dorsey as the new municipal judge in Florissant appears to have succeeded.Final unofficial returns show 4,142 write-in votes were cast for judge in Florissant, more than twice the number received by incumbent Daniel Boyle.But Election Board officials said they won't know for sure how many of those actually listed Dorsey's name until each ballot is individually reviewed — a process that could take at least a week.Boyle, the only candidate listed on the ballot, decided to move to Oklahoma after the deadline for withdrawing from the race and endorsed Dorsey, an assistant city prosecutor, to succeed him.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri auditor says Parson administration illegally changed tax withholding tables this year,"Apr 3, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-auditor-says-parson-administration-illegally-changed-tax-withholding-tables/article_f9266f72-7c79-5aae-84c0-816d66452000.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Missouri Auditor Nicole Galloway said Tuesday that Gov. Mike Parson’s administration broke state law when Department of Revenue officials quietly adjusted tax withholding tables in January amid worries the state would not meet its financial targets.Galloway said the administration of Parson, a Republican, changed tax withholding tables in January 2019, adjustments that have resulted in “over-withholding” from paychecks. She said the adjustments should have been made after a public hearing process.While Galloway acknowledged that withholding changes do not alter the amount of tax one ultimately owes, she said the Department of Revenue’s changes had caused confusion.

The department changed tax withholding tables twice in 2018 after federal and state tax cuts. Withholding adjustments made last year are at least part of the reason the state is not currently meeting revenue projections this fiscal year, analysts and lawmakers have said.Galloway, a Democrat, said that her office presented a draft of her audit to the Department of Revenue last month. Then-Director of the Department of Revenue Joel Walters resigned shortly thereafter, on March 15.His resignation also followed continued digging by a Missouri House committee into the errors made last year.The Columbia Daily Tribune also reported, shortly before Walters’ resignation, that the Department of Revenue planned to warn Missourians about the risk of surprise tax bills last year, but ultimately elected not to send out a news release imploring taxpayers to withhold more from their paychecks.“The decision to take more money out of paychecks without following the law shows a clear pattern of mismanagement,” Galloway told reporters Tuesday, “and the resignation of one unelected bureaucrat does not equate to accountability.”She said the 2019 changes required public input.
Because of the state’s mistakes last year, Galloway’s office said, Missourians owe an additional $134 million when filing their returns this year, and the state will pay out $232 million less in tax refunds.In response to Galloway’s audit, Walters sent a brief letter to Galloway on March 18 saying the state would “take steps to inform taxpayers of the potential impact of changes made to the state’s withholding tables.”Parson said Galloway was engaging in “scare tactics.”
“Our focus has consistently been on reforming and reducing taxes for hardworking Missouri families and small businesses,” Parson said. “We’re not interested in engaging with someone that prioritizes partisan politics and scare tactics over the long-term benefits of federal and state income tax cuts.”As of Monday, state revenue was down $266 million compared with the same point last year, or 3.96 percent. If the state fails to meet revenue targets, Parson could be forced to withhold some state spending before the end of this fiscal year, June 30.The House sent the Senate last week a $30 billion budget proposal that assumed modest revenue growth next year; the Senate could be forced to slash planned spending for next fiscal year if revenue collections don’t improve.Editor's note: An earlier version of this story incorrectly attributed a quote by Parson to his spokeswoman

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Governor fills post of St. Louis County judge who was ousted by voters,"Apr 2, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/governor-fills-post-of-st-louis-county-judge-who-was/article_3eeca03e-182f-59b1-91cc-b2da3f051b33.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Gov. Mike Parson filled a vacant seat on the St. Louis County bench Tuesday, selecting a state labor attorney for the post.Virginia Lay will take over as associate circuit judge for the 21st Circuit from Judge Judy Draper, who was ousted from the position by voters in November.Lay, a Clayton resident, is an attorney for the Missouri Division of Employment Security as well as an adjunct professor at Washington University School of Law. She earned a bachelor’s degree in English and American Studies from Columbia University and a Juris Doctor degree from Washington University School of Law.  

During her tenure with the state, Lay has represented agencies like the Missouri Highway Patrol and the Department of Corrections in cases ranging from false imprisonment to excessive force claims.
Draper failed to receive enough votes to stay on the job, becoming only the fourth Missouri judge since 1940 to have been removed by voters. The last time it happened was in 2016 when nearly 60 percent of voters said St. Louis County Associate Circuit Judge Dale Hood should not be retained.













St. Louis County Associate Circuit Judge Judy Draper



Missouri judges are evaluated by a 20-member judicial performance committee. The committee voted in 2010 that she should not be retained, but in 2014 and 2018 voted that she should be. In the 2018 evaluation, 13 committee members said that Draper substantially met overall judicial performance standards, while seven said she did not. Her evaluation had the lowest marks for being prepared for court, for rulings that cited applicable law and for decisions that “followed logically from the evidence presented.”Gov. Bob Holden appointed Draper to the bench in St. Louis County in 2004. She earned a bachelor’s degree from the University of North Carolina and a law degree from Howard University. She previously served as a municipal judge in Berkeley and Northwoods.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"In debate over online sales taxes, some in Missouri GOP want to give it back","Apr 1, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/in-debate-over-online-sales-taxes-some-in-missouri-gop/article_2f1b62f5-90ab-5799-aaf8-5a29e4093f1f.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Republicans may control the levers of government in Missouri, but they are not in lockstep when it comes to collecting taxes from online sales.While some see the potential revenue as a way to keep pace with the rising costs of running government, or as a means to pump more cash into education or road and bridge construction, others in the party in power see it as an opportunity to lower income tax and corporate tax rates for Missourians.The disagreement over what to do with an estimated $165 million in future annual proceeds is becoming a focal point under the dome as the Legislature heads into the final seven weeks of the spring session.

Last year, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that states could start collecting revenue from online sales from out-of-state businesses that don’t have a physical presence in a state.Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican, said in December that he wanted to see a tax enacted in order to level the playing field for in-state companies and their out-of-state competitors.The prospect of a new source of money for the state comes as revenue is arriving below projections, potentially forcing Parson to withhold money from various programs in order to keep the state’s budget balanced.Although more money could start flowing as Missourians pay their state income tax bills, revenue collections as of Wednesday were down $286.7 million from the same point last year, or 4.3 percent.However, instead of using the money to fill in budget holes or pay for road and bridge construction or education, some Republican lawmakers say the state should reduce taxes for Missouri residents and businesses.In the House, Rep. J. Eggleston, R-Maysville, is sponsoring a bill that would reduce the top individual income tax rate over two years if sales taxes increase at a certain rate once they are being collected from online sales.Sen. Andrew Koenig, R-Manchester, is sponsoring a similar proposal in the Senate.During an earlier floor debate, Sen. Tony Luetkemeyer, R-Parkville, said the money from online sales could be used to eliminate the corporate income tax.
“I look at the tax relief that could be provided to all the small, family-owned businesses,” Luetkemeyer said.Sen. Eric Burlison, R-Springfield, also suggested that he’d like to see the revenue used to lower taxes.“I think it’s important to keep our tax rates low,” Burlison said.
Sen. Bill Eigel, R-Weldon Spring, among the most vocal supporters of lowering income and corporate tax rates, said he agrees with Parson that more money needs to be spent on repairing the state’s roads and bridges.But, Eigel said, “There’s disagreement on how we get from here to there. I believe we need to reduce the tax burden and this is a way to move forward with that.”Rep. Chrissy Sommer, R-St. Charles, said a decision on how to proceed had not been made. As chairwoman of the House Ways and Means Committee, she’s held hearings on bills calling for online sales tax collections that wouldn’t require revenue to be returned to taxpayers through cuts to income or corporate taxes.“I understand there are those who wish that money could be returned. But it’s more complicated than that. Some of us are already paying taxes on online purchases,” Sommer said.Parson, meantime, is staying out of the debate over what should be done with the money.“We’re going to continue working with the Legislature. It is an issue that deserves serious debate,” the governor’s spokesman Steele Shippy said.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Messenger: Answer to Missouri River flood control found in serene waters of Cora Island,"Mar 31, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/columns/tony-messenger/messenger-answer-to-missouri-river-flood-control-found-in-serene/article_9706ea70-8f4b-5590-ab17-28dd87631fc4.html,"CONFLUENCE POINT • Mike Clark has a rule for the river guides who work for him.“We don’t fight the river,” says the longtime St. Louisan known locally as Big Muddy Mike.Clark has probably spent more time paddling the Missouri and Mississippi rivers than anybody not named Lewis or, um, Clark.

On Thursday, I tagged along as Clark scouted river levels in the slow-motion disaster already known as the Flood of 2019. The water was high, but not 1993-level high. And there’s a reason for that.It becomes obvious in the calm water that snakes around Cora Island. There, in a channel dug by the Army Corps of Engineers and managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, are about 1,400 acres that are part of the Big Muddy Refuge. It’s part wildlife preservation and part flood control, and as the water furiously sped past in the Missouri River’s main channel nearby, it seemed like the most serene place on earth.Rising water seeped into wetlands and meandered around copse after copse of willow and cottonwood trees. The songs of red-winged blackbirds filled the air. A bald eagle swooped by with a stick in its beak. He landed in the massive nest he was building high above the confluence.On the day I was there, Gov. Mike Parson wrote an opinion piece about the flood that has devastated farmland in northwest Missouri, closed Air Force bases in Nebraska and swallowed small river towns in South Dakota, Iowa and Kansas.“We must begin a serious discussion about how we improve flood control on the Missouri River,” Parson wrote.This place, right here, is where that discussion must begin.
When Missouri politicians issue bromides after flooding, they almost always focus on two easy targets. U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley hit them both last week in one statement that could have been pulled from the archives of pretty much any flood since 1944: “The Corps is hamstrung on the one hand by radical environmentalist lobbyists that are forcing the agency to prioritize wildlife over farmers. This is made worse by the fact that Congress has failed to give the Corps a clear ranking of priorities or clear orders on how to achieve them.”Without the Corps and the environmentalists — people like Greg Poleski who not only pushed for the Cora Island preservation but helped plant the cottonwoods that now help sustain the wetlands — the Big Muddy Refuge wouldn’t exist. And that means the water on the other side of the island would be flowing faster. The flagpole at Confluence Point that marks the 1993 high-water point might be under water. More than just a few roads in St. Louis and St. Charles County would be inundated with water and closed.This is the part of flood control that the Dutch long ago figured out, that the nation’s experts pointed to in 1993 in the Galloway report, that Poleski and Clark and others like them speak about every chance they get, that still escapes the politicians who know they have to say something after a flood but don’t really want to do the heavy lifting to stop the next one. It’s the lesson that Clark imparts to his young guides.
Don’t fight the river. Give it room to roam.That was why the Big Muddy Refuge was created by Congress, as a result of the Flood of 1993. Today, along the Missouri River between Kansas City and St. Louis, more than 16,000 acres are set aside where chutes and channels allow the Missouri River to reclaim the floodplain where it used to roam before the federal government deepened its channel, strengthened its banks and added wing dikes and other man-made structures that sped the water up in an attempt to create navigation commerce.But the scientists who led the call for the creation of the Big Muddy Refuge imagined as much as 60,000 acres being preserved and returned to wetlands in Missouri alone. Congress not only hasn’t finished the job, every time there is another flood it forgets the lessons of the previous one, and rattles sabers about raising levees rather than letting the river do its thing.There was a time when the owners of Cora Island produced corn and soybeans on a farm of rich bottomland soil. It was protected by an agricultural levee, most of which is still there. You can see it on both sides of the channel, where the Corps cut a permanent hole in it, to let the Missouri River go where it wanted to. There, the water rises so it doesn’t do so in other nearby farms. There, the water fills the wetlands instead of covering urban highways. There, the power of nature provides the flood control that Missouri’s politicians say they want.We’ve known that since at least 1999, when the creation of the Big Muddy Refuge began in earnest, when a federal official signed the legislation at a ceremony in St. Charles County that signaled a change in strategy.It was time, said William Hartwig of the Fish and Wildlife Service, to start “cooperating with the river.”

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Editorial: Serious or not, bill to invalidate federal gun laws in Missouri is repugnant","Mar 31, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-serious-or-not-bill-to-invalidate-federal-gun-laws/article_8b638db7-cdee-5ef4-b4fd-32ede62e4dde.html,"Just when you thought the Missouri Legislature couldn’t get any loopier on guns after recent proposals to require firearms ownership, here comes more crazy. A new measure seeks to declare all federal gun laws “null and void” within Missouri’s borders.Such a measure will never take force for multiple reasons — not least of which is that its underlying premise that states’ rights supersede federal statutes was conclusively rejected long ago, at places with names like Appomattox and Gettysburg. Whatever message the legislation might be intended to send, the message America is getting is that there must be something in Missouri’s water.An earlier move to require gun ownership was in the form of two bills by state Rep. Andrew McDaniel, R-Deering: one to mandate any adult legally allowed to own a firearm do so, and the other to mandate that young adults buy AR-15 semi-automatic rifles — with the help of a state tax credit.

It’s unclear if state Sen. Eric Burlison, R-Springfield, is serious about his legislation to declare Missouri unbeholden to the gun laws of the United States — what inadequate few there are. Since a serious play for legislation like that would be both legally indefensible and philosophically repugnant, perhaps he should be given the benefit of the doubt with an assumption this is just another soapbox bill.Come to think of it, it’s still pretty repugnant, in light of the tens of thousands of gun deaths America endures annually.
Among the federal gun restrictions Burlison’s “Second Amendment Protection Act” would in theory set aside are background checks on gun sales through federally licensed dealers, as well as federal restrictions on the manufacture and civilian ownership of fully automatic weapons.
Polls show vast majorities of Americans (including Missourians) favor tougher background checks, not their elimination. Background checks are a last line of defense to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and people who are too mentally unstable to have them.And does Burlison think machine guns on the streets would make Missourians feel safer? It didn’t work so well on the streets of Chicago in the 1930s.Missouri’s Republican-controlled Legislature went down this rabbit hole before, in 2014, perhaps secure in the knowledge that then-Gov. Jay Nixon, a Democrat, would veto it. Current Gov. Mike Parson has displayed a more level-headed attitude than many of his fellow Republicans. But if this bill gets to him, who knows?No federal judge in the country would — or should — let such a measure stand; there isn’t a realistic danger of Missouri becoming the next Fort Sumter. But these kinds of ideological games by Second Amendment extremists contribute nothing good to the urgent national conversation America is trying to have about the crisis of gun violence. And it certainly does nothing good for Missouri’s reputation."
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri DNR will soon have new oversight of state energy policy — a development some are treating with caution,"Mar 30, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/business/local/missouri-dnr-will-soon-have-new-oversight-of-state-energy/article_f56ad878-4194-5eb2-abd3-5202e1c0aeb3.html,"A government office that grants money and technical assistance to energy efficiency and renewable energy projects around Missouri will be shuffled between state agencies this summer.The state Division of Energy, which has more than 30 employees, will be transferred from the Missouri Department of Economic Development to the Missouri Department of Natural Resources on Aug. 28. The move was first announced in an executive order from Gov. Mike Parson in January, but has now cleared a 60-day window in which lawmakers could have raised concerns .Some tout the change as a welcome part of efforts to streamline and realign state government organizations to emphasize core aspects of their mission. Others, though hopeful that the move can benefit state energy and environmental policy, will keep a cautious eye to ensure that it is not accompanied by political interference from the DNR to control the division’s focus or give more favorable treatment to fossil fuels.

“The impetus for a lot of this is our ‘Best in Midwest’ campaign,” said Maggie Kost, the director of communications and marketing for the Department of Economic Development, referencing an ongoing effort to evaluate how Missouri compares to neighboring states. She said Missouri is not doing as well as its regional peers whose government agencies are more “laser-focused” on economic development functions.“When everything is a priority, nothing is a priority,” Kost said. “We had more functions than any peer agency.”Kost and many others say it’s a logical fit to pair the Division of Energy with the DNR. In fact, the division had formerly been part of the DNR, before being moved into the economic development sphere in 2013, under Gov. Jay Nixon.Although the DNR said many details about the transition — from logistical questions to policy aims — have yet to click into place, agency officials expressed enthusiasm about the move.
“Transferring @MO_DivofEnergy back to MoDNR will benefit @MoGov by expanding our department’s ability to balance a healthy environment w/ a healthy economy,"" said @CarolSComer1. We're working together w/ @MoEcoDevo & @GovParsonMO to ensure a smooth transition. #MissouriForward pic.twitter.com/KifrSakczS— Missouri DNR (@MoDNR) March 19, 2019

“For us, moving the DOE back to DNR expands our ability to do that healthy environment, healthy economy balance that we’re always talking about,” said Connie Patterson, a department spokeswoman. “We’re looking at it as an opportunity to work very closely with them on energy policy for the state of Missouri.”Though it’s unclear what, exactly, that may entail, pursuit of an “affordable” and “reliable” energy strategy has been emphasized in initial statements from the DNR. Around the country, those exact terms have, in some cases, become weaponized buzzwords in political fights that oppose renewable energy. But the DNR says it has no such motive to favor fossil fuels over lower-carbon sources of energy.“We support all methods of generation and renewable energy under that umbrella along with everything else. And a lot of that is market-driven,” Patterson said. “Everything’s on the table for discussion, and we’re all looking for opportunities to support that affordable and reliable energy strategy.”Others are cautious, such as Steve Mahfood, a former director of the DNR.Given the “inexorable” link between energy production and environmental issues, he agrees that operating within the DNR is a good fit for the division, but the track record of the current administration concerns him.
The agency, for example, has recently proposed controversial rules about how to regulate coal power byproducts such as coal ash, in response to new legislation that electric utilities helped shape.Current DNR leadership has also overseen a steep drop in enforcement actions — a trend met with alarm by some, despite assurances from the DNR that environmental quality in the state is not being compromised amid a broad push to slash regulatory “red tape.”“A lot of what DNR now does seems to support traditional energy industries — coal-fired power plants and things like that, instead of renewables,” Mahfood said.“My cynical side says maybe this is a way to focus on what we’ve been doing and maybe suppress any kind of new generation and green energy approach.”Mahfood said the Division of Energy has historically had a “very strong role” within the DNR and “has been very successful in making things happen at a local level.”
But he wonders if soon having the two as part of the same “tightly wound package” could expose state energy policies to political meddling, with energy regulators and promoters again under one roof.“If you’ve got (the Division of) Energy over in (the Department of) Natural Resources, you’ve got all the components of supporting the industry as it currently is,” he said. “Being in one department, you’ve got one voice, it can all be directed upwards and the message can be controlled.”Moving forward, Mahfood said, environmental watchdogs will need to keep an eye on ensuing energy policies that emerge from the DNR, or other signs, such as who the department might allow to testify in support of bills or Missouri’s Comprehensive State Energy plan, developed by the division.Potential changes in policy could ultimately rest with DNR leadership, and specifically with director Carol Comer, appointed by former Gov. Eric Greitens. Before coming to Missouri, Comer had been commissioner of the Indiana Department of Environmental Management under Vice President Mike Pence, while he was the state’s governor.“Does she have a vision for this addition?” asks Josh Campbell, the executive director of the nonprofit Missouri Energy Initiative.“It’s very possible she may have an agenda she wants to push. We don’t know what it is — it could be great.”He doesn’t think the DNR’s early statements stressing “affordability” and “reliability” signal a looming fight against renewables, noting that those are key aspects of any energy policy and the prevailing trends in energy generation. Power generators are turning away from coal “on their own free will,” he said, with Missouri electric companies and municipal utilities increasingly shifting plans toward wind and solar — economic momentum that can’t be reversed by politics.“When you look at what’s been going on the last few years,” Campbell said, “that horse has left the gate.”

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,HUD Secretary touts Opportunity Zones in St. Louis,"Mar 29, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/business/local/hud-secretary-touts-opportunity-zones-in-st-louis/article_11ca20f4-b907-5d5f-9be7-e30998934fd4.html,"Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson touted the benefits of new federal tax rules designed to encourage investment in lower income areas during a visit Friday to St. Louis.The tax rules, known as Opportunity Zones, were part of the 2017 tax bill Congress passed and allow investors to put capital gains into designated areas with lower incomes. Investors who hold their money there for a decade can be eligible for big breaks on capital gains taxes.Carson said the rules, which investors have just started to use, give them the incentive to make sure their properties are maintained and successful long term.

“If you’re putting your money in there, any reasonable investor wants a good return on their investment,” he said.Carson toured the North Sarah Apartments in the Vandeventer neighborhood, a mixed-income housing project developed by McCormack Baron Salazar. He was joined by Missouri Gov. Mike Parson, St. Louis Mayor Lyda Krewson, U.S. Rep. William Lacy Clay and Missouri state Sen. Brian Williams.Carson also toured the City Foundry in Midtown, a $210 million redevelopment of the former Federal Mogul foundry site. St. Louis Development Corp. Director Otis Williams said City Foundry developer Steve Smith of the Lawrence Group had raised several million dollars in an Opportunity Zone fund to help finance the project.
Other projects in the Midtown area have also announced Opportunity Zone investments recently. This week, Midas Hospitality announced it had raised $35 million in an Opportunity Zone fund from St. Louis investors to help finance two hotel projects it is building: a 129-room Aloft Hotel in the Cortex tech district and a 152-room Element hotel on Forest Park Parkway across from City Foundry.“The success and excitement building in and around the Cortex (district), as well as the need for these attractive hotels in that area, were a huge draw for our prestigious list of investors,” said J.T. Norville, co-founder of Maryland Heights-based Midas Hospitality. “The significant tax benefits afforded by the recent legislation changes have been the icing on the cake, and we couldn’t be prouder that St. Louis is realizing the advantages of this new opportunity.”
Opportunity Zone investments are starting to come in around the country even though the regulations have not been finalized.St. Louis, though, is gearing up to try and attract more capital with the tax benefits of Opportunity Zones. Williams said local planning firm Development Strategies is producing marketing materials and information to provide to prospective Opportunity Zone fund investors on behalf of the city.Carson said the final rules should be finished in about six weeks. “A lot of investment has already come in around the country.”

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Better Together faces another challenge: backlash from lawmakers in Jefferson City,"Mar 28, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/better-together-faces-another-challenge-backlash-from-lawmakers-in-jefferson/article_dc6e70e2-6951-5a18-b582-177bb58fc92e.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Opponents of a statewide vote to merge St. Louis and St. Louis County are pushing back with a flurry of measures that would undercut Better Together’s ballot proposal.The proposal, the details of which were first unveiled in January, would meld the city, county and all 88 county municipalities into a “metropolitan city” with a unified government and police department.If Better Together supporters gather enough signatures, the question would be put to a statewide vote in November 2020. Backers filed a revised petition Monday, removing County Executive Steve Stenger as the would-be mayor of the first “metro city.”

Several lawmakers have filed resolutions that would compete with Better Together on that statewide ballot. The resolutions would need House and Senate approval before voters get a say.“They’re probably going to get their signatures and they’re probably going to get on the ballot,” former state Sen. Joan Bray, D-University City, told a Missouri House committee hearing on Wednesday, “but unless you put something there as well that prevents that proposal from just rumbling through, it passes.”The legislative-backed initiatives would by default be placed on the November 2020 ballot, but the election date could change at Gov. Mike Parson’s discretion.A resolution sponsored by Rep. Dean Plocher, R-Des Peres, says that if a merger passes statewide, voters in the city of St. Louis and St. Louis County would have to approve the merger in a separate referendum for it to take effect.He said he would not take a position on the merger itself, but said residents in the city and county should “have an independent say.”Several lawmakers and others who testified before the House General Laws Committee said they are receptive to some kind of consolidation, but oppose the statewide vote method by Better Together.“It should have the support of the people that live there,” said Rep. Peter Merideth, D-St. Louis, who added that “fragmentation” is the region’s second largest problem, behind inequity.The Better Together proposal, if approved by voters, would strike the obscure city-county Board of Freeholders, a panel that if convened is supposed to consider consolidation, as outlined by a century-old provision in the state constitution.By contrast, if approved by voters statewide, a proposal by Rep. LaKeySha Bosley, D-St. Louis, would allow a vote on consolidation only if a Board of Freeholders recommends consolidation.The only voters allowed to weigh in on such a referendum would be voters in the city of St. Louis and the county.A third measure, sponsored by Rep. Maria Chappelle-Nadal, D-University City, would classify the city as St. Louis County’s 89th municipality.The secretary of state’s office has said, most recently with last year’s medical marijuana vote, that if multiple constitutional amendments dealing with the same subject appear on the same ballot and pass, the one with the most support takes effect.
A fourth proposal, by Rep. Shamed Dogan, R-Ballwin, is a nonbinding resolution that denounces the statewide vote. The measure only requires the backing of both legislative chambers, and would not go to the voters.It’s a “very strongly worded resolution,” Dogan said. “The idea that it should happen without the consent of the governed … is deeply offensive to a lot of us.”Opponents of the statewide vote packed a Capitol hearing room to support legislative push back.“Allowing people to vote who are not directly affected, and do not have any vested interest, and do not live in the city nor county of St. Louis, and quite frankly don’t care about this issue,” said Mavis Thompson, St. Louis license collector, “is not only a threat to our democracy but it’s also a misapplication of what I believe the original framer’s intent was.”No one testified against the legislative proposals.
St. Louis Mayor Lyda Krewson said Thursday she’s not opposed to requiring separate elections in St. Louis and St. Louis County on the merger plan “if that’s the way it turns out.” She stopped short, however, of saying she supported adding a local ratification requirement.She said, however, that a statewide vote also would still be required because a state constitutional change is needed to create a new class of city.“You could do it before (a statewide vote), you could do it after or you could do it at the same time,” she said of the idea of holding separate ratification votes in St. Louis and St. Louis County. Krewson was asked about the proposals in the Legislature at a news conference in her office.The legislation is HJR 54, HJR 37, HJR 43 and HCR 25.Mark Schlinkmann of the Post-Dispatch contributed to this report.(tncms-asset)26d19272-3f83-11e9-a840-00163ec2aa77[0](/tncms-asset)(tncms-asset)41b13384-404d-11e9-a9e6-00163ec2aa77[1](/tncms-asset)(tncms-asset)c2d71270-4f30-11e9-a085-00163ec2aa77[2](/tncms-asset)(tncms-asset)41d7bcf6-2a32-11e9-aa7c-00163ec2aa77[3](/tncms-asset)

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Editorial: Legislature conjures magic money to fund a make-believe 2020 budget,"Mar 27, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-legislature-conjures-magic-money-to-fund-a-make-believe/article_87704858-da21-55e9-9f12-935c81de1797.html,"This week, lawmakers waved their magic wand, reached into their hat and, once again, pulled out a dead rabbit. The $30 billion preliminary spending plan for the 2020 fiscal year, approved by House members Tuesday, is legislative sleight of hand to disguise the $353 million shortfall resulting from previous, misguided tax cuts.The state cannot produce the revenues it needs for its most urgent priorities because lawmakers, blinded by tax-cut mania, reject the concepts of simple math. Even when State Auditor Nicole Galloway did the math for them last year, warning that their tax cuts would yield billions of dollars in future shortfalls, they proceeded anyway.

Sadly, we know where this will lead because we’ve seen it before. Instead of restoring a sensible tax base and imposing gasoline taxes to fund much-needed highway and bridge repairs, lawmakers ultimately will try to balance the budget by cutting programs that help the state’s neediest and most vulnerable.This disastrous magic act has been assisted by former Gov. Eric Greitens and his successor, Mike Parson. On his last day in office, Greitens signed a bill to cut the state’s corporate tax rate from 6.25 percent to 4 percent. Shortly after assuming office, Parson signed another bill cutting individual income taxes from 5.8 percent to 5.4 percent.

“Reducing taxes is beneficial to Missouri families and will play a vital role in our state to restoring our economy,” Parson said as he signed that bill. The idea was that tax cuts would spur consumer spending and business investment, leading to higher employment and an aggregate increase in revenue. The actual result after more than two dozen tax cuts since 2014, however, is that Missouri’s revenue collections are down by 5.3 percent from this time last year.The irony in this scenario is that Parson has actually set some admirable goals for infrastructure improvements and workforce development. But those are expensive endeavors, and the money isn’t there to pay for them. The Legislature has always had the power to increase gasoline taxes to fund much-needed highway and bridge repairs, but Republicans won’t allow it. So the infrastructure deterioration deepens. Lawmakers won’t even let Parson fund his bridge projects by borrowing the $350 million he needs.Stay tuned for the Legislature’s next magic act, in which they wave a wand to balance the budget by underfunding public defenders’ offices, school transportation and vital social programs that help drug addicts recover or poor people house and feed their children. That’s the old razzle-dazzle."
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri's governor populates his administration with former colleagues,"Mar 27, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-s-governor-populates-his-administration-with-former-colleagues/article_64f6ee57-d914-588f-b5d1-0865b32c1d54.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Although he’s been governor for less than a year, Gov. Mike Parson has appointed or hired at least 13 former state lawmakers to serve in key posts in his administration.On Wednesday, his latest appointee, former Sen. Brian Munzlinger, appeared briefly before a Senate panel en route to his likely confirmation to the Missouri Probation and Parole Board by the Legislature’s upper chamber on Thursday.Parson appointed the Republican from Williamstown to the $86,000 per year post two weeks ago. The board reviews whether prison inmates should be granted parole or conditional release.

Munzlinger, a farmer, left his $35,900 per year job as a lawmaker in January after 16 years in the House and Senate. He served alongside Parson in both chambers for much of his tenure.He faced few questions from members of the Senate Gubernatorial Appointments Committee, several of whom he previously served with.“It’s different sitting on this side,” Munzlinger told the panel.It is not uncommon for governors to appoint members of the Legislature to various boards and commissions.For example, former Gov. Eric Greitens named former Sen. Jason Crowell to the Missouri Housing Development Commission and former Rep. Paul Fitzwater, R-Potosi, to the probation and parole board.Greitens also appointed former Sen. Ryan Silvey to the Public Service Commission, which regulates utilities.Silvey’s appointment raised eyebrows because he had repeatedly clashed with Greitens, leaving observers to speculate the governor was attempting to remove a critic from the Legislature.
In 2011, former Gov. Jay Nixon denied accusations that he appointed former Rep. Dennis Fowler of Advance to the Board of Probation and Parole as a political reward for his vote against an income tax cut.Fowler was among 15 Republicans who had to uphold the Democratic governor's veto of the bill.Since taking office in June, Parson has used his appointment power to name at least 12 former lawmakers to posts within his administration.Former Senate Majority Leader Mike Kehoe of Jefferson City took over Parson’s old job as lieutenant governor. Former Sen. Eric Scmitt of Glendale was named attorney general in January after Josh Hawley vacated the position for a seat in the U.S. Senate.
Former House Budget Chairman Scott Fitzpatrick is now the state treasurer, filling Schmitt's vacancy.Parson also picked former House Speaker Todd Richardson to be the director of the state’s Medicaid program.Former Rep. Marsha Haefner, R-Oakville, was hired as a liaison in Parson’s St. Louis satellite office. Former Rep. Justin Alferman, R-Hermann, is serving as Parson’s chief legislative director.Lyndall Fraker, a former state representative from Marshfield, was tabbed to oversee the implementation of the state’s new medical marijuana law and former Sen. Jay Wasson, R-Nixa, took a position on the state tourism board.Former Rep. Don Phillips was named to the Probation and Parole Board after he left the Legislature due to term limits and former Rep. Robert Cornejo, R-St. Peters, became a member of the Missouri Labor and Industrial Relations Commission.Other former lawmakers appointed to positions by Parson include Bob Nance of Excelsior Springs, who was named to the Clay County Board of Election Commissioners in November and Gary Nodler of Joplin, who joined the Coordinating Board for Higher Education in August.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Missouri House OKs $30 billion budget, adding money for roads and education","Mar 27, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-house-oks-billion-budget-adding-money-for-roads-and/article_f0dc8b17-2204-5305-bce4-886906104a89.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • The Missouri House on Tuesday gave initial approval to a $30 billion spending plan for next fiscal year, a blueprint that includes a new scholarship program, new money for roads and more money for education.Next year’s spending plan assumes modest growth in revenue of 2 percent. This year’s budget also assumed a modest increase. But, so far this year, the state has seen no growth in revenue. The opposite is true.As of Monday, revenue collections were down $353 million from the same point last year, or 5.3 percent. The figures mean Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican, could be forced to freeze some spending before the fiscal year ends June 30.

It is unclear whether or how the Senate will address the shortfalls; analysts hope collections will ultimately grow by the end of tax filing season.Medicaid funding would again increase next year under the House’s budget. According to the plan, the state would spend $11 billion on the health care program for the poor, up from $10.5 billion in this year’s budget.The increasing costs have drawn scrutiny from officials, who want to spend $34 million next year on a Medicaid “transformation” effort outlined in a report released last month.














        
            New report recommends $1 billion in annual savings with overhaul of Medicaid in Missouri

The state could alter reimbursement rates for hospitals, doctors and nursing homes, shift more people to home-care services and better manage prescription drug costs as a way to rein in rising costs.




In one of Tuesday’s most high-profile moves, the GOP-controlled House broke with Parson in regard to the governor’s plan to borrow $350 million for bridge projects.The House instead voted to spend $100 million from general revenue on road projects.Rep. Jon Carpenter, D-Kansas City, said the state had not historically used general revenue for such projects, instead relying on the road fund for improvements. Carpenter said the general revenue should be used elsewhere.He proposed using $69 million of the $100 million for road funds to increase funding for home health services. House Budget Chairman Cody Smith, R-Carthage, said the state had already devoted more money to the issue elsewhere in the budget.Carpenter also proposed using $31 million of the $100 million on the public defender’s office, which is chronically underfunded.His amendments failed.“Right now, Missouri’s roads and bridges are in need of repair,” said Smith, who argued the state should use general revenue for road repairs to avoid raising gasoline taxes or borrowing money.Parson’s proposed borrowing of $350 million to fund the repairs would cost about $100 million in interest over 15 years.Smith wants the Legislature to keep the $100 million figure constant for four years, but that means lawmakers could raid the line item in future budgets.The House budget increases funding for the public defender’s office by about $1.6 million, which includes $1.1 million for juvenile offices in St. Louis and Kansas City, and $500,000 to address a case backlog.














        
            Missouri children are waiving their right to legal counsel. That's a problem, some lawmakers say.

""Children, and particularly children who get into trouble, don't exercise good judgment,"" said Rep. Ingrid Burnett. ""And so, expecting them to exercise good judgment when it comes to waiving their rights I think is a stretch.""




The office would still be underfunded by about $30 million under the House legislation, according to the office and an outside audit.Education fundingThe House also designated $3.55 billion to the state’s K-12 education funding formula, a $62 million increase over this year.
Smith said the amount would fully fund the state’s school aid formula.The House also designated $108 million to school transportation costs, a $5 million increase over this year.Rep. Judy Morgan, D-Kansas City, said the proposed transportation funding levels still “aren’t even in the ballpark” of what is needed.














        
            Missouri takes districts for a bumpy ride when it comes to bus funds

School bus inspections show rural schools may suffer more than suburban ones. 




School districts are paying for transportation costs by taking money out of other pots, she said. Other Democrats said overall education funding still was inadequate.The House designated $195 million for early childhood special education programs, a $3 million increase over the current year’s appropriation.The program is designed to improve a child’s skills before the child enters kindergarten. According to the department’s budget request, 97 percent of students “substantially improved” their skills upon exiting the program, higher than the national average.
Rep. Peter Merideth, D-St. Louis, sponsored an amendment that would have given high-need families priority when applying for Parents As Teachers services. He said 1,500 high-need families are on a wait list because the state has underfunded the program. Merideth’s amendment failed amid concerns from Republicans about local officials maintaining control over the program.The House also voted to keep core funding at universities constant, and devoted $18 million to Parson’s new “Fast Track” scholarship program.The House authorized devoting $10 million in unused lottery funds to pay for part of the Fast Track program, freeing up general revenue that would have gone to the scholarships. General revenue was then shifted to cover other priorities, including $2.5 million for rural broadband efforts.The House rejected, on a 42-99 vote, a Democratic attempt to allow public universities to charge undocumented immigrants living in Missouri in-state tuition. The state currently requires schools to charge international tuition to such students, costing those students thousands of dollars more than other residents.“I certainly think that we should prioritize those that have legal status in our state first,” said Smith, who opposed the amendment.Democrats argued the amendment would not negatively affect other residents, and would improve the state’s economy by helping students better themselves.“Yes, you can work here, yes, you can pay taxes here, but what you cannot do is pay in-state tuition,” said Rep. Bruce Franks, D-St. Louis.Failed amendmentsDemocrats, who control less than a third of House seats, attempted to influence state policy in other ways, including offering an amendment to forbid state spending on capital punishment.“This is about whether or not we should spend money as a state to kill people,” Merideth said.Rep. Don Rone, R-Portageville, suggested it was hypocritical of Democrats, who had voted to “kill babies” by supporting abortion, to advocate for ending the death penalty. “The babies have not done anything,” Rone said. On death row inmates, “they made their own bed, so to speak.”A handful of Republicans joined Democrats to support the amendment, but it failed on a vote of 43-102.Democrats also wanted to block state aid to police departments that allow “shackling of pregnant women who are in labor.” Republicans voted down the amendment on a voice vote.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Messenger: Northwest Missouri farmer weighs in on the Flood of 2019, 'This is the very worst.'","Mar 26, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/columns/tony-messenger/messenger-northwest-missouri-farmer-weighs-in-on-the-flood-of/article_bff89902-df1e-5afd-8739-a093055b3e2f.html,"LEXINGTON, Mo. • From atop the Ike Skelton Bridge, the Missouri River looks a couple of degrees below angry. The river is irascible, perhaps, a bit indignant, but not yet raging, not here, under Highway 13 on the road that connects Lafayette County to Ray County.Here, the water has room to roam, and it is doing that, filling up some bottomland through chutes that give the swollen river an outlet. For now, the soybean and corn fields to the north and south are fine, still available for spring planting. The railroad tracks are dry.That’s not the case about 180 miles northwest, in Langdon, where the farmhouse Richard Oswald’s father built is under water, like most of the farms and many of the small towns along the Missouri River in northwest Missouri, in eastern Kansas, in Iowa and Nebraska.

That’s where Oswald was when we talked on Friday, in Auburn, Neb., staying with his fiancée. He won’t be back to his 160-acre farm for a couple of weeks at best. He won’t be able to work the fields and start cleaning up after the Flood of 2019 for at least a month.“I’m no youngster,” Oswald says. “I’m 69 years old. I’ve lived here all my life. And I’ve never seen weather like this.”I first talked to Oswald in 2011, the last time his farm flooded. At the time, he wrote an op-ed for the Post-Dispatch editorial page, lamenting the inability to manage the Missouri River Basin for flood control, trying to balance the interests of farmers, business owners, environmentalists and recreational users, leading to situations like those in 2011, and again in 2019, where the U.S. Corps of Engineers releases a deluge of furious flows from the Gavins Point Dam in Yankton, S.D., knowing full well what is likely to come.Here’s what Oswald wrote in 2011 when his farm was under water.“The corps does everything by an operations manual. This is supposed to de-politicize the river so that everyone knows what to expect — even in the face of unusual events. Special interests and politics have rewritten that guide through the Missouri River Compromise so that it now seems to create more of these unusual events than it solves,” he wrote. “The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ River Manual is the equivalent of what an average citizen could expect if he allowed special interests to plan his vacation. This year, the corps seems to have planned mine.”About an hour after we spoke, Oswald emailed me the most recent corps river advisory. The corps had hoped to drop Gavins Point Dam water releases below 20,000 cubic feet per second by Friday night. Instead they would be increased to 32,000 cubic feet per second on Saturday. Releases from the Fort Randall Dam upstream were also supposed to increase.It takes about a day and a half for the water to get from Fort Randall to Gavins Point; and another couple of days for the water to get from South Dakota to Oswald’s farm, nestled between Interstate 29 and the Missouri River, which marks the border between Missouri and Nebraska.This year’s forced summer vacation will be a long one.“My house has been flooded four times,” Oswald says. He ticks off the years: “1952, 1993, 2011, 2019. This is the first time water’s been on the ground floor.”
For a variety of reasons, the Missouri River — and to a certain extent the Mississippi, too — is no longer acting like a “big river” able to absorb the blow of a big snowpack and heavy spring rain, says Washington University scientist Bob Criss. In 2016, he published a paper that outlined the problem.It’s a combination of factors, Criss wrote. Climate change is making weather patterns more intense. But America’s big rivers in the middle of the country have been walled off, taking away their room to move, as they did more than a century ago, reclaiming flood plain when there was too much water to contain.“The big rivers have no place to go so, now they’re acting like small rivers,” Criss says.There’s another problem, Oswald notes.
“There has been a lot of talk about infrastructure these days,” he says. Indeed, Gov. Mike Parson in Missouri is seeking money to replace old bridges. President Donald Trump keeps talking about coming up with money for river and road projects, but little progress is made. “These dams and levees we rely on are all 80 to 90 years old. They aren’t able to sustain the kind of weather events we see in the age of climate change.”For farmers like Oswald, it’s been a tough year. Trump’s trade war has cut corn and soybean prices in half. The flood has claimed 20,000 bushels of corn he had stored, and he won’t be able to plant this year. Crop insurance will keep him afloat.Like other veterans of big floods, Oswald says this one is different:“It’s a lot more intense than what we’ve experienced in other floods. This is the very worst.”

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Stretch of Lindbergh Boulevard named for late Missouri lawmaker Cloria Brown,"Mar 25, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/stretch-of-lindbergh-boulevard-named-for-late-missouri-lawmaker-cloria/article_ad8fba25-03d0-569e-b866-8fa1089b82e9.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • A section of Lindbergh Boulevard in south St. Louis County has been named after a former state lawmaker.Gov. Mike Parson signed legislation Monday designating the heavily commercial stretch between Interstate 55 and Lin Ferry Drive as the “Cloria Brown Memorial Highway.”Brown, a Republican, represented the Mehlville area three times. Her first two-year term was in 2010. After losing in 2012, she returned to win the district in 2014 and 2016.

Brown died last year after battling cancer.
In a ceremony in Parson's office, lawmakers hailed Brown's service.""As a state representative, she served with grace and commitment,"" said Rep. Patricia Pike, R-Adrian.
“We are grateful for Cloria Brown’s service to the State of Missouri. She worked hard to make a difference for constituents and to the state,”  said Sen. Scott Sifton, D-Affton.The legislation, which was approved unanimously in January by the House and Senate, calls for private donations to pay for the signs, which would then be erected by state highway crews.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Judges would have more flexibility on prison terms under plan Missouri lawmakers are studying,"Mar 25, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/judges-would-have-more-flexibility-on-prison-terms-under-plan/article_3d9f64d4-9fb6-5c18-9931-96c275519880.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • In the latest bid to overhaul Missouri’s criminal justice system, a Senate panel voted unanimously Monday to give judges more flexibility when they are sentencing people to prison.The legislation, which now heads to the full Senate, would make minimum prison terms discretionary for offenses that do not involve the use of force or result in serious physical injury. Also exempted are crimes of sexual conduct against a child and offenses that include the use of a firearm.The action came against the backdrop of a visit to the Capitol Monday by Matthew Charles, a former federal prison inmate who was released in January following the approval of a criminal justice reform effort signed by President Donald Trump in December.

Charles, who was Trump’s State of the Union guest, is traveling across the country urging lawmakers to support sentencing and prison reforms.“This mass incarceration or long, extensive sentences need to be changed because it’s not actually thwarting people from committing crime,” Charles said at a press conference.Senate Bill 8, sponsored by Sen. Ed Emery, R-Lamar, is similar to a House bill also working its way through the Legislature.The Missouri Department of Corrections estimates the changes would reduce the prison population by 466 inmates by 2023, saving the state an estimated $3 million.The state has already seen a drop of about 2,000 inmates from a high of more than 33,000 last year, which is allowing Gov. Mike Parson to close the Crossroads Correctional Center in Cameron, Mo.The change in sentencing laws is among a number of criminal justice reform efforts that have won support from Republicans and Democrats in the first half of the Legislature’s annual session.Rep. Shamed Dogan, R-Ballwin, announced Monday he would introduce a package of legislation later this week that would include a number of changes to the state’s criminal code in an effort to lessen the number of people in prison and ease the way for ex-offenders to get jobs and stay out of prison in the future.
“We’re locking up the wrong people and for too long,” Dogan said.The package will include legislation sponsored by Rep. Justin Hill, R-Lake Saint Louis, designed to reduce the incentive for private probation companies to drug test defendants charged with misdemeanors that have nothing to do with alcohol or drugs.
Also included is a bill co-sponsored by Rep. Bruce DeGroot, R-Chesterfield, that eliminates jail time as a penalty for failure to pay a county jail board bill.Democrats are tracking the legislation, but were hoping the various proposals would have been further along in the legislative process.“We are definitely in support of some of the measures that are going through,” House Minority Leader Crystal Quade, D-Springfield, said Monday.But, she added, “I was hopeful that we’d have things going through faster.”Dogan said combining various reforms into one bill could get the changes over the finish line before lawmakers adjourn for the year in mid-May.Charles, 52, was released from a Kentucky jail after Trump signed a new law in December designed to reduce recidivism among federal prisoners.Charles was sentenced to 35 years in prison for selling crack cocaine in 1996. He served for more than two decades without facing any disciplinary action while also taking college courses.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Lawmakers face May deadline for funding bridges, deciding who gets Medicaid, changing how campuses handle sexual assault","Mar 24, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/lawmakers-face-may-deadline-for-funding-bridges-deciding-who-gets/article_c47b5797-73ef-5340-9a0a-b2a281d7ef97.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • High-profile debates loom for Missouri legislators headed back to the capital city after their week-long spring break.The 163-member House and the 34-member Senate will return Monday to the Capitol for the second half of their annual legislative session, which ends in mid-May.On the schedule: a near-total ban on abortions in Missouri, a controversial proposal to change how colleges handle sexual assault claims, a plan to require Medicaid recipients to work and a potentially spirited debate over charter school expansion.

Gov. Mike Parson’s agenda also is on the front burner as he pushes a plan to borrow $350 million to pay for the repair or replacement of more than 200 bridges.Republicans who control the House have rejected the governor’s idea and instead want to tap into the state’s general checkbook for transportation funding, rather than take out a long-term loan.Parson’s fellow Republicans also have raised concerns about his plan to create a $22 million scholarship program aimed at getting adults into high-demand jobs.School choice advocates in the Senate, including Republican Sens. Bill Eigel of Weldon Spring and Andrew Koenig of Manchester, have used the scholarship program as a bargaining chip to push for an expansion of charter schools and a voucher-like program that would create education savings accounts to allow students to attend out-of-district schools.Although neither idea has moved forward in either chamber, Senate President Pro Tem Dave Schatz said negotiations were underway.“We believe we’re close to getting some compromise on those issues,” said Schatz, R-Sullivan.Parson, a former legislator, said he was working to keep his plan intact.“No matter what corner of the state we visit, individuals and businesses share the same concerns about the future of our workforce,” Parson said. “Businesses cannot find the workers that they need to help their businesses grow. At the same time, we have folks who need good paying jobs, but they don’t have the right skills.”The debates come against the backdrop of lagging revenue collections by the state. As of Wednesday, revenue collections compared with the same point last year were down $358.7 million, or 5.6 percent.The budget this fiscal year is based on the assumption that revenue will grow at 1.7 percent over last year’s levels. Because of the lagging collections, Parson could withhold money from this year’s budget.And, budget negotiators could be forced to rethink the entire $30 billion spending blueprint for next fiscal year, which starts July 1. That budget assumes 2 percent growth over this fiscal year.“That’s something we’re monitoring,” said House Speaker Elijah Haahr, R-Springfield, when asked before spring break whether he was confident the state would meet its financial goals. “We’ll continue to monitor that over spring break.”Rep. Kip Kendrick of Columbia, the ranking Democrat on the House Budget Committee, sounded the alarm at a news conference following Haahr’s.“No,” he said when asked if he was confident the state would meet its targets. “I’m becoming less optimistic that we hit that 1.7” percent growth.Who gets Medicaid?Democrats and Republicans have criticized the way Parson’s administration has handled the implementation of President Donald Trump’s tax cuts, which will result in thousands of Missourians paying surprise tax bills because employers did not withhold enough from their paychecks, the result of an error by the Department of Revenue.The effects of a 2014 income tax cut also are coming into focus. The tax cuts are expected to cost the state $320 million in revenue next fiscal year. Republicans are hopeful the reduced tax bills will spur the economy and result in more revenue rolling in.Meantime, the Senate is expected to continue its efforts to reduce the number of people receiving state benefits.
One proposal requires people to work in order to receive Medicaid.Sen. David Sater, R-Cassville, said requiring people to work, attend school or volunteer for 80 hours a month would break a cycle of dependency.“Medicaid was originally designed as a safety net for the truly vulnerable. Over time, the program grew to cover new groups, changing the original intent of the program,” Sater told senators in a debate last month.Sen. Jamilah Nasheed, D-St. Louis, blasted Sater.“Senator, you never cease to amaze. It seems to me you have a serious, serious problem with the poor,” Nasheed said. “All you seem to do is attack the most vulnerable in our communities.”Sen. Jill Schupp, D-Creve Coeur, said the legislation would end up costing the state more than it saved because people who lost Medicaid coverage would seek health care at more expensive outlets, such as hospitals.The proposal is among a number of Republican attempts to reduce state spending on welfare programs, including one that would require people receiving food stamps to work.
Sater said he was attempting to reduce the growth of the Medicaid program, which costs the state about $10 billion a year and accounts for about one-third of the state budget. The rising costs have sparked a planned overhaul of the program designed to save up to $1 billion annually.Of the more than 81,000 adults between the ages of 19 and 64 who receive Medicaid benefits, analysts say 6,580 will fall under the work requirement.Of those, the department estimates that 65 percent, or 4,277, will fail to comply, saving the state an estimated $2 million.Campus sexual assaultOpposing factions also will be lining up to debate changes to how colleges and universities handle claims of sexual misconduct.As of last week, the dark-money group Kingdom Principles had hired nearly 30 lobbyists to advocate for the proposal, according to the Missouri Ethics Commission.“I’ve never seen this happen,” Kendrick said. “All of a sudden there are 20-plus lobbyists hired to silence victims of sexual assault?”Legislation pending in the House and the Senate would allow complainants and respondents to transfer their case from the university to the state Administrative Hearing Commission, an idea Kendrick railed against during the news conference.Colleges and universities, especially private schools, have said that because they are private, the state should not determine whom the college may enroll, similar to a business choosing whom to employ.Kendrick said business owners “should be concerned” that the Legislature would one day force businesses to allow cases of sexual misconduct to be heard before the Administrative Hearing Commission rather than internally.Dan Mehan, president of the Missouri Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said his group was monitoring the legislation but had not taken a position on it.Senate Majority Leader Caleb Rowden, a Republican who represents Columbia and the University of Missouri area, said he was keeping a careful eye on any changes to the Title IX process.“There’s no scenario in which we should swing the pendulum too far the other way. We’ve got to be hyper-sensitive to that,” Rowden said.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Midwest farmers see crops swept away by flood,"Mar 23, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/state-and-regional/midwest-farmers-see-crops-swept-away-by-flood/article_6b4a012f-1fdc-5321-b118-cf75ce1b5047.html,"SIDNEY, Iowa  •  His farm is still cut off by floodwaters, so Iowa soybean farmer Pat Sheldon had to view the damage from the air. On a helicopter ride over what seemed like an endless stretch of water, he came to a place he recognized as his own land — and saw that one of the grain silos had burst open, spilling yellow soybeans into the dingy, toxic water.""It was like a punch in the gut,"" Sheldon said.""You work hard planting, taking care of these beans and harvesting them. Then, to have that happen makes you almost physically ill,"" he said. ""But I haven't had time to get mad — too many responsibilities and people that need still need help.""

Although the water has yet to recede enough for a true examination, Sheldon says more than $350,000 of his corn and soybeans is in jeopardy, and he worries he may lose the farm that's been in his family for generations.Before the terrible ""bomb cyclone"" sent warm rain down on frozen ground, resulting in catastrophic flooding throughout the Midwest and displacing thousands, U.S. farmers were already struggling after several seasons of low commodity prices and the continuing trade war with China. In towns along the overflowing Mississippi and Missouri rivers, farmers are seeing their crops — and their futures — swept away by floodwaters.In Nebraska, Gov. Pete Ricketts, a Republican, has called the flooding ""the most widespread destruction we have ever seen in our state's history."" Iowa has more than 100,000 acres of farmland still underwater. Officials from both states say the damage estimates are more than $1 billion and counting.""It's devastating for a lot of these folks, there's no doubt about it,"" said Jeff Jorgenson, a farmer and board member of the Iowa Soybean Association. ""Essentially, it's two years of negative; these farmers lost what was stored in the bins and won't be able to plant next year's crop. So it's going to be really tough for a lot of people.""But, he added, ""if we get the opportunity, we'll go to work.""Some farmers had more soybeans in storage this year than normal, according to Frayne Olson, a crop economist and marketing specialist with North Dakota State University. The government estimates there are more than 3.7 billion bushels of soybeans still in storage — a record — partly because Chinese purchases of the grain have plummeted in recent months during the ongoing tariff war.Iowa farmers have about 528 bushels in storage, up 8 percent from the previous year, while Nebraska had 13 percent more grain stored, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department's estimate.""A lot of farmers have not been selling, hoping for better prices and some kind of trade agreement,"" Olson said.As floodwaters are receding across some parts of the Midwest, new threats loom.The Missouri River is continuing its destructive course south into Missouri where Gov. Mike Parson declared a state of emergency, as governors have already done in Iowa, Wisconsin and hard-hit Nebraska.The river is expected to crest this weekend in Atchison, Kan., and state officials urged residents of at-risk towns to evacuate.Threats are emerging from the north over the next week, where warm temperatures are causing snow to melt rapidly in the Dakotas and Minnesota, releasing vast quantities of water into streams and rivers, meaning some areas will have little chance to dry out before a new deluge arrives.
In Sioux Falls, S.D., the Big Sioux River is expected to have two crests — one late Monday and another on Friday. The Mississippi will likely peak later in the week in St. Paul, Minn. Ten miles to the south, the city of Cottage Grove declared an emergency in anticipation of flooding from the river, which is expected to peak there on March 30.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration warned people to prepare for a prolonged disaster.""The stage is set for record flooding now through May,"" said Mary C. Erickson, deputy director of NOAA's National Weather Service. Edward Clark, director of NOAA's National Water Center called it ""potentially an unprecedented flood season.""There are some 40,000 soybean farmers in Iowa. In the past several years, 1 in 3 rows of soybeans have been sent to China, meaning farmers were heavily impacted after China virtually stopped buying American soybeans last year, according to the Iowa Soybean Association.But some of the farmers who gathered Thursday at the Silver Spur Bar and Grill in Iowa's Fremont County — a population of about 7,400 — didn't want to talk about tariffs, saying they felt their plight was being used to fuel political debate on cable news shows and by Washington.
""We like what the president's doing,"" Sheldon said. ""As the farmer sees it, we've had times a lot worse for grain prices as we've got right now. We know China's been screwing us for years, not only on farm products but on technology. We know we can duck our heads and pull our boots on and get through this, and, in the long run, the whole country is going to be better off.""The farmers said they were more concerned with the way the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers was handling the management of the river. They said they received little warning from the Corps before levees breached and their land was flooded, and many did not have time to move their grain to safety.""Our story is that we're devastated. We're faced with losing a whole year's income, maybe two,"" said Brian Johnson, 57. ""We've got a problem with the way the river is being managed. How are we going to recover? How can we keep our land and continue to farm?""The Army Corps of Engineers has long been criticized for a plan to control the Missouri River that farmers say prioritizes wildlife protection over flood control. A federal claims court judge ruled last year that Corps policies contributed to some flooding. After touring flood damage in Missouri last week, Parson said it was time to ""reevaluate"" the Corps' management of the Missouri River.A spokesman for the Corps' office in Omaha did not return calls for comment.""We've had no real communication from the Corps of Engineers since this started,"" said Mike Crecelius, the emergency management coordinator for Fremont County.He estimates that there have been 14 breaches in their levees alone, causing $147 million in damage — more than a $100 million from farm crops and equipment.""It's been one big nightmare,"" he said.Sellers reported from Washington.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Missouri River flooding forces evacuation of 7,500 from St. Joseph","Mar 22, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/state-and-regional/missouri-river-flooding-forces-evacuation-of-from-st-joseph/article_1dcd6b73-d6f7-566b-9274-0b667e4e337b.html,"ST. JOSEPH, Mo. • Record floodwaters that submerged vast stretches of Nebraska and Iowa farmland along America's longest river reached a new crest on Friday at the waterfront city of St. Joseph, forcing chaotic evacuations of thousands from low-lying areas.With emergency sirens blaring as the Missouri River rose to the top of the three-story-high levee wall in St. Joseph, about 55 miles north of Kansas City, Mo., sheriff's deputies rushed door-to-door urging residents to flee to higher ground.About 1,500 residents and 6,000 employees of neighboring businesses were ushered out of the southern end of town, a city official said. Most of the evacuated dwellings were trailer homes interspersed among factories, warehouses and stockyards along a stretch of the riverfront known as ""the Bottoms.""

Many residents appeared stunned as they scurried out of their homes with armloads of hurriedly gathered belongings to throw into their vehicles before joining a steady stream of cars, pickup trucks, SUVs and tractor-trailers.The abrupt evacuation, coming as the river rose just over 15 feet above flood stage -- slightly exceeding the previous record of 32.1 feet -- appeared to take authorities and residents by surprise.""We don't have anywhere to go. This is overwhelming,"" said Linda Roberts, 70, as she and her husband, John, 66, packed their SUV, their dog sitting uneasily in a pet carrier.With police doing their best to direct gridlocked traffic and with helicopters whirring overhead, dust billowed up from packed roadways for hours, mixed with the odors of livestock and chemicals, as the mass exodus proceeded in slow motion.The St. Jo Frontier Casino, about 5 miles to the north, was already surrounded by water, and roadways along the river were submerged, officials said.The flood crest was expected to reach the Kansas towns of Atchison and Leavenworth, about 35 miles farther downstream, on Saturday, and Kansas City as early as Sunday, officials said.Flood record broken
Missouri River flooding was triggered by last week's ""bomb cyclone"" storm, which killed at least four people, drowned livestock and closed dozens of roads across a large swath of Nebraska and Iowa. Property and financial losses for the two Midwestern states were projected to surpass $3 billion.Torrential showers over hundreds of square miles of melting snowpack produced record volumes of runoff that poured into the Missouri just above the Gavins Point Dam where the river divides Nebraska from South Dakota, nearly 400 miles upstream from Kansas City. The dam is operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.Water entering the reservoir from that storm marked the greatest volume measured there in 120 years of recordkeeping, said John Remus, chief water manager for the Army Corps' Missouri River basin.The downstream flow, breaking flood stage records at several locations along the river, has placed enormous strain on the region's system of flood-control levees. Nearly 50 levee breaches have been confirmed in the Army Corp's Omaha district alone, encompassing the hardest hit parts of Nebraska, Iowa and Missouri, officials told a news briefing.
Nebraska farmers were digging out of flooded fields and coping with cut-off highways on Friday.""The biggest thing right now is the transportation. We're right between Loup and Cedar River, and transportation is nearly impossible,"" said Ryan Sonderup, 36, of Fullerton, Neb., who has been farming for 18 years.Officials downstream were carefully watching flood gauges in Atchison, Kan., a community of about 10,000 residents where a handful of riverfront properties and roads were under threat of flooding.Missouri Gov. Mike Parson declared an emergency on Wednesday as high water forced evacuations of several small farm communities in the northwestern corner of his state.President Donald Trump on Thursday approved a disaster declaration for Nebraska, making federal funding available in nine counties ravaged by last week's floods. Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds on Friday requested a presidential disaster declaration for 57 flood-stricken counties in her state.The threat of extensive flooding lingers over the wider Midwest and could grow dire in coming weeks with additional rainfall and melting snow runoff, putting more than 200 million people at risk, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said on Thursday.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri governor visits three state prisons to promote pay raise plan,"Mar 22, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/missouri-governor-visits-three-state-prisons-to-promote-pay-raise/article_aea6fb04-015b-5cb5-84d1-1b6af9e9dbdb.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Armed with the promise of a long-sought pay raise for Missouri prison workers, Gov. Mike Parson visited three of the state’s 21 lock-ups Friday.Parson, a Republican, made stops at facilities in Farmington, Bonne Terre and Charleston, where workers at the state’s largest agency could see raises of as much as 13 percent depending on how long they’ve worked for the Missouri Department of Corrections.The money is included in the House version of the proposed state budget for the fiscal year beginning July 1. The estimated $8.3 million cost comes on top of $1,050 raises that went into effect last year in an attempt to slow the high rate of turnover in the agency.

“The governor continues to work to boost staff morale,” Parson spokesman Steele Shippy told the Post-Dispatch on Friday.In January, the Parson administration announced plans to consolidate Crossroads Correctional Center and Western Missouri Correctional Center, both in Cameron, and use the savings to give raises to most of the 11,000 workers at the department.Employees in the agency are among the lowest paid in the nation, with correctional officer salaries starting at $28,000 and topping out at $44,476.The pay rate has hampered the department’s recruitment and retention of corrections officers. The job vacancy rate peaked in September 2018, when 848 of the 4,733 guard positions were open. The most recent numbers available show turnover rates of over 18 percent.The lack of adequate staffing was partly blamed for conditions that sparked a riot by inmates at the Crossroads facility last year. Inmates were angry about being forced to stay in their cells because of a staffing shortage.On May 12, more than 200 inmates staged a sit-in at the dining hall over reductions in recreation time and other programs. Prison workers were able to convince 131 inmates to end the standoff, but 78 prisoners spent the next six hours rampaging in a central services building.
The Missouri Highway Patrol and local police had to be called in to help quell the disturbance.Once the facility is shuttered, the staff at Crossroads will drop to nine from 386, with the remaining workers maintaining the empty facility. The budget will fall to $310,000 from more than $13 million, according to the budget plan pending in the House.In mid-2017, Missouri had the eighth-highest incarceration rate in the U.S. Officials say recent changes in the criminal code, coupled with criminal justice reform initiatives, have caused the state’s prison population to drop by more than 2,000, placing the department in a position to shutter Crossroads.
“Our efforts to restructure state government is driven by this administration’s dedication to finding efficiencies wherever we can,” Parson said. “While restructuring is important for the people of Missouri, I also want to be very clear that the problem is not our state workforce. As a former law enforcement officer, I understand and appreciate the value and challenges our correctional workers face.”The budget plan backed by Parson, a former Polk County sheriff and state lawmaker, calls for all state workers to receive a 3 percent raise on their current salaries.Under the separate pay raise proposal for Corrections, workers would get the 3 percent boost and then also a 1 percent raise for each of the two years that they have been working, up to 20 years. Someone who is earning $44,000 and has been with the agency for two decades would see his or her salary jump to $49,720.Parson, who was accompanied on his prison tour by Corrections Director Anne Precythe, met with corrections officers, support staff and supervisors, as well as each facility’s administrative team during the tour.“I appreciate Gov. Parson’s vision to restructure state government and his willingness to make the tough decisions necessary to support our team,” Precythe said.

Wentzville-based Cosmos has had a presence in Missouri since 1989 and employs more than 100 people locally. With the expansion, the company plans to add 60 full-time jobs by early 2020, when construction is completed. The company is eligible to receive up to $50,700 in tax exemption incentives and $893,844 from the state’s Missouri Works program, according to Missouri Department of Economic Development officials.
“We are honored that they chose to continue growing and basing their operations here in Missouri,” Gov. Mike Parson said in the statement.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,New St. Peters facility to create nearly 100 jobs,"Mar 20, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/suburban-journals/stcharles/new-st-peters-facility-to-create-nearly-jobs/article_13e093fd-152c-5362-87bc-e1eb585eaa77.html,"Central States Manufacturing, Inc. is the latest company to join the business boom in St. Peters with a new manufacturing and retail operation in Premier 370 Business Park, according to a press release.The $6.3 million dollar project is the first operation for Central States in Missouri and is expected to open later this year. The new 53,600 square-foot plant will have 88 new jobs when it is completed on a 12.4 acre site at 9001 Premier Pkwy, in St. Peters.Groundbreaking for the new facility was held on site in late February following the event announcing the new Central States Manufacturing operation in St. Peters.

“We are so happy to welcome Central States Manufacturing to St. Peters and the new, full-time jobs with benefits they are bringing to our hometown,” St. Peters mayor Len Pagano said. “Central States is the newest business to speed their idea into reality with the hard work of our FasTrac team and I look forward to working with our new neighbors as they join our outstanding community.”“We want to extend a big, warm welcome to Central States Manufacturing,” Missouri governor Mike Parson said. “We’re excited to be part of this company’s growth and we look forward to working together as they create jobs and continue to invest in this region.”The St. Peters site will be the 10th location for Central States Manufacturing.
“We are very excited about our new facility in St. Peters,” said Adam Haynes, vice president of sales and marketing for Central States Manufacturing, Inc. “This location will allow us to better serve our customers in the Missouri and Illinois area with faster lead-time to help grow their business. The community has been very receptive and I look forward to working with our new employees to find ways to serve and to be an outstanding resource for our neighbors.”The new full-time jobs will bring another $2.641 million dollars in annual payroll to St. Charles County, already one of the fastest growing counties in the United States.
“We are pleased that Central States Manufacturing has chosen to locate their new facility in St. Peters,” St. Charles County executive Steve Ehlmann said. “It takes all of us, working together, to continue to bring major investments to the region.”The expansion by Central States Manufacturing is yet another example of how the Missouri Partnership, Missouri Dept. of Economic Development, St. Louis Regional Chamber, St. Charles County and the city of St. Peters are teaming up to bring great companies and jobs to our region.“We are excited that Central States Manufacturing is expanding its operations to St. Peters,"" said Tom Chulick, president and CEO, St. Louis Regional Chamber, who led the regional recruitment effort. ""The new jobs will have a positive impact on our region. Again, this demonstrates that this is a great place to work, live and invest.""“It was a great pleasure to work alongside the Missouri Dept. of Economic Development, the St. Louis Regional Chamber and the city of St. Peters to support Central States Manufacturing as they create 88 new jobs in St. Peters,” said Steve Johnson, CEO of Missouri Partnership. “Missouri’s highly skilled labor and low business costs were key factors in Central States Manufacturing strategic decision to grow their business here and we are proud to welcome Central States Manufacturing to Missouri and look forward to their continued success.”"
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Editorial: What's the Legislature's rush to redo laws on university sexual assault cases?,"Mar 18, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-what-s-the-legislature-s-rush-to-redo-laws/article_f120100f-444d-5081-9fba-2bc72b628172.html,"The Missouri Legislature seems suspiciously in a hurry to embed in state law a series of changes to the way universities handle sexual assault cases. Some of the changes would go far beyond those being contemplated by the Trump administration at the federal level. Dark-money influences appear to be behind this effort to rush into law a measure that deserves far more careful consideration and debate.The legislation, House Bill 573 and Senate Bill 259, is opposed by a wide range of private and public universities and colleges in Missouri. A major fear is that the proposed changes would discourage sexual assault victims from coming forward, in part because the bills outline ways accusers can be held financially liable if they fail to prove their cases.The bills also could escalate legal confusion if they conflict with new Title IX guidelines under review by U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. Title IX outlaws gender discrimination at educational institutions that receive federal assistance. The Obama administration tightened Title IX requirements in 2011 to encourage sexual assault victims to come forward, but the changes are under attack for circumventing due process. There is some justification for those complaints, which is why DeVos’ review is necessary to ensure victims as well as the accused receive fair treatment.

The Missouri Legislature doesn’t want to wait for DeVos to finish the job. What’s the hurry?Universities have long held autonomous status in America, relying on campus police and private disciplinary processes to investigate and adjudicate cases involving students. Many universities allow student-faculty disciplinary councils to adjudicate even rape cases. Serious criminal offenses belong in the hands of police and skilled prosecutors, not student-faculty panels.
Laws should direct universities to encourage victims of serious criminal cases, first and foremost, to go to the police. Students should be warned that it can be invasive. “The rape victim is always on trial. What she has to go through is horrific at times,” says Joe Bednar, a former sexual assault prosecutor in Jackson County. There’s always a careful balancing act between securing justice and protecting the victim’s privacy.
University motives are always in question. Do they seek to keep serious cases “in house” to avoid news coverage when an athlete, faculty member or major donor is involved? A common complaint involving campus disciplinary panels is that there is too often a rush to judgment because of a lower standard of proof than what applies in criminal court proceedings.There are no easy answers here. Missouri lawmakers, however, suggest there are, and they want to rush their flawed solutions into law even before the new federal Title IX guidelines are announced.None of this reckless approach makes sense. If legislative leaders won’t put a stop to these bills, Gov. Mike Parson should intervene with a veto."
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Education official who drew scorn from Missouri Senate seeks seat in Missouri Senate,"Mar 18, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/education-official-who-drew-scorn-from-missouri-senate-seeks-seat/article_5097c11e-3749-52f0-8e04-59db318fe8ec.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • A Republican the Missouri Senate once attempted to ban from serving on the Missouri Board of Education again is now seeking a seat in the chamber that rejected him.Eddy Justice, 46, a GOP organizer from Poplar Bluff, announced Monday he was running in 2020 to replace term-limited state Sen. Doug Libla, R-Poplar Bluff, in the Missouri Senate.

The State Farm insurance agent says he supports President Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” agenda and is running as a “conservative outsider” to “stand up for (constituents’) rights as Americans and to keep government off our backs.”Former Gov. Eric Greitens appointed Justice to the education board in 2017 as part of the former governor’s plan to oust then-Education Commissioner Margie Vandeven.Justice and four other Greitens loyalists on the board did fire Vandeven, but the strong-arm tactics infuriated a bipartisan coalition of senators.The move against Vandeven took place before senators had a chance to approve or reject Greitens’ nominees.The Senate ultimately declined to approve Justice and four other nominees. That meant, according to the state constitution, they could never again serve on the education board. The nominees withdrew their names from consideration and argued that, because of the maneuver, they would not be subject the lifetime ban.Questions over the validity of the lifetime ban would likely be settled by the courts if a future governor chose to reappoint any of the nominees.Libla, a close ally of Sen. Gary Romine, a Farmington Republican who advocated for the bans, said he would not comment on whether he would support Justice’s campaign.“There will probably be a primary for my seat,” he said. “It would be inappropriate for me to be making any comments one way or the other at this time.”The board under Gov. Mike Parson, the former lieutenant governor who replaced Greitens in June, has since re-hired Vandeven as education commissioner.
Justice said he would advocate for charter school expansion if elected.“I believe we have to give these kids an option if their schools are failing,” he said in an interview. “If it comes in the form of charter schools, so be it.”














        
            Vouchers, charter school expansion are getting push from Republicans in Missouri



Libla opposes expansion, saying charter schools have a “very dismal record of success in urban school districts.” The schools are currently allowed only in St. Louis and Kansas City.
Justice also said “all options are on the table” in regard to increasing the state’s gasoline tax to fund road and bridge repairs, something Libla has supported.Justice said past differences with the Senate would not impair his relationship with other senators.“They’re professionals, as I believe I am, and I think that if elected we’ll be able to work together in a productive manner for the people of our districts and the people of Missouri,” he said.The 25th Senate District takes in most Bootheel counties — Butler, Dunklin, Mississippi, New Madrid, Pemiscot, Stoddard — as well as Carter and Shannon counties.No other Republicans have announced bids for the seat.As far as the general election, some Bootheel counties and Shannon County historically have had Democratic tendencies, but voters have shunned the party on the state and federal level for several cycles.Libla in 2012 won 56 percent of the vote, besting Democrat Terry Swinger, who won 44 percent. Libla cruised to re-election in 2016, winning nearly 70 percent of the vote.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Editorial: Making the case for clemency for Renae Greene,"Mar 17, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-making-the-case-for-clemency-for-renae-greene/article_e2a91c88-287e-561a-8761-78e7ba27093c.html,"No one was physically hurt when Renae Greene held up a Joplin pharmacy in 1989. Yet, Greene has spent as much time in prison as a woman incarcerated for first-degree murder — 28 years. She is effectively serving a life sentence for a crime that didn’t deserve such a harsh punishment.In reviewing Greene’s case, Gov. Mike Parson might not walk away feeling warm and fuzzy about her. She was no angel. She did the kinds of reckless and dangerous things drug addicts are prone to do. But more than enough time has passed in which she has been able to prove her rehabilitation.Greene is in her mid-60s. At the time of the robbery, she was 32 and had been addicted to drugs since her teens. She entered a Medicine Shoppe pharmacy operated by David and Sheree Starrett with a gun and demanded “green alcohol.” Greene ordered the Starretts to lie on the floor. She fired shots near their heads and demanded Dilaudid, synthetic morphine.

David Starrett gave Greene 50 tablets of Dilaudid. She fired another shot into the ceiling of the pharmacy before leaving through the front door. The Starretts remembered the day well and, as of a 2014 report in The Joplin Globe, opposed clemency, which is understandable for people who experienced what they did.Greene was tried three times because of errors made by attorneys. She was eventually convicted, receiving a 30-year sentence for pharmacy robbery and a life sentence for armed criminal action. Her clemency petition notes that in Missouri the average sentence for an offender convicted of first-degree robbery, which accounts for use of a firearm during the crime, is 17.9 years. So why such a disproportionate and harsh sentence for Greene?
Her early family life put her on a predictable path. She ran away from home at age 13. Prostitution followed. After becoming addicted to drugs and alcohol, she forged checks and was convicted of carrying a concealed weapon.
In prison, she finally got sober and attended years of Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. She also completed an Impact of Crime on Victims class and accepts responsibility for the pain and suffering she caused others by her actions.Greene will be eligible for parole in 2029, when she will be 74. A life sentence seems overly harsh for a crime in which the victims were certainly terrorized with fear at the hands of a drug addict — but no one was physically injured. She has been rehabilitated by addressing the root cause of her criminal behavior — addictions that caused her life to spiral out of control.Greene deserves to have her case reviewed with an eye toward commutation. She didn’t physically harm anyone, yet she is paying a far greater debt than others who have."
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"'Moderate' flood stages expected on St. Louis area's major rivers next week, as high water moves downstream","Mar 15, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/state-and-regional/moderate-flood-stages-expected-on-st-louis-area-s-major/article_eeded9ab-d3bc-5e66-8ccd-d3312e3f4894.html,"ST. LOUIS • As flooding pounds areas of the Missouri River basin in Nebraska, Iowa and South Dakota, downstream river levels in St. Louis are poised to crest over the coming week.By next Thursday, the Mississippi River at St. Louis is expected to creep into a “moderate” flood stage, according to National Weather Service data. With the river expected to rise more than 7 feet in the next week, some impacts could be felt in low-lying areas and various floodgates will be closed along the St. Louis riverfront.Reaches of the Mississippi River upstream from its confluence with the Missouri River can also expect to see some floodwater, particularly in places like Clarksville, in Pike County, where there are no levees in place. The town requested sandbags from the St. Louis District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, according to Scott Ross, the district’s chief of public affairs.

Besides sending sandbags to the area, Ross said the corps is also keeping an eye on Lock and Dam 24 in a nearby stretch of the Mississippi River.“We are anticipating that we may have to close it,” Ross said. “We think the forecast will bring us to that at some point next week.”Despite the extended forecast of “flood stage” conditions, other localized flood impacts around the St. Louis area may be limited, according to Mark Fuchs, a hydrologist with the National Weather Service office in St. Charles.He explained that “minor impacts start kicking in” when rivers reach a “flood stage” designation — which the area is expected to experience from the weekend through Wednesday, as water rises. At those levels, he said impacts are typically confined to lesser-traveled roads, athletic fields and other things that commonly occupy floodplains along rivers.But then, once rivers reach a “moderate flood stage” — the next level of severity, and the one projected to hit the region late next week — larger roadways and some buildings can be affected, Fuchs said.Things are much worse farther upstream on the Missouri River, where flooding has already prompted a range of emergency responses, including the release of water Thursday held behind the Gavins Point Dam near Yankton, S.D.Additionally, high water and dangerous currents led the U.S. Coast Guard to announce Friday that all boat traffic would be halted on a 100-mile stretch of the river, from about 50 miles south of Omaha, Neb., to St. Joseph, Mo.Meanwhile, any vessels between the Kansas City area and St. Joseph were requested to maintain a minimal wake “to minimize levee damage.”
“Restrictions to operations will be lifted as soon as conditions improve,” the Coast Guard announcement said.Missouri Gov. Mike Parson surveyed flooded areas in northwestern Missouri on Friday afternoon. His office indicated that 140,000 acres of the region’s floodplain were expected to see an impact from flooding, and said that work was underway in communities such as St. Joseph to sandbag and bolster levees.

South of Omaha, multiple locations in Nebraska were bracing for record crests along the Missouri River, Fuchs said.Those unprecedented flood levels, though, won’t surge all the way downstream to St. Louis, he added. Instead, the high water will be dispersed as swollen river channels widen and gain the capacity to hold more flow.“By the time it gets into our neck of the woods, it’s not as big a deal,” said Fuchs.The flooding upstream is a result of snowmelt and recent heavy rain. Fuchs warned that plenty of snow and ice remain in parts of the Upper Mississippi watershed, such as Minnesota and Wisconsin, setting the stage for other possible flood risks to come — particularly if that snowmelt is accompanied by more rain.“If that happens too fast, we could see a return to these conditions or possibly higher,” he said. “If we have a big rain event, it could get interesting.”

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Editorial: Legislators approve harsh anti-abortion measure, inconsistencies be damned","Mar 15, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-legislators-approve-harsh-anti-abortion-measure-inconsistencies-be-damned/article_668e8315-8bed-5d97-aa9d-6e4f3591885d.html,"Missouri’s Republican state legislators are betting the conservative shift on the U.S. Supreme Court will usher in a new era of abortion restrictions and eventually an outright revocation of a woman’s right to chose. Never mind that their devotion to the rights of fetuses stands in stark contrast to their absence of concern for children and mothers beyond the womb.State legislators have passed a “heartbeat” bill, House Bill 126, that would ban an abortion as soon as a fetal heartbeat can be heard, typically around eight weeks. It would effectively criminalize most abortions in the state.The law would become one of the most restrictive in the country if the GOP-controlled Senate advances it. The bill includes provisions declaring “that God is the author of life,” requires that both parents be notified before a minor can receive an abortion; bans abortions on the basis of race, sex or whether the baby has Down syndrome, and establishes a so-called “trigger clause” that would completely ban abortion, except in cases of medical emergency, if the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.

This bill doesn’t even offer an abortion exception for cases of rape or incest.Sen. Jamilah Nasheed, D-St. Louis, pledges to filibuster this effort to deny women the fundamental right to make their own medical decisions and to jeopardize the health and welfare of abuse victims.
A familiar name is behind this measure: Rep. Nick Schroer, R-O’Fallon, who also has sponsored bills to restrict public access to government information, including information covered under the Clean Missouri amendment approved by voters in November.
He and other zealots in the Legislature are clearly out of touch with a substantial number of, if not most, Missourians. In a 2014 Pew survey, 45 percent of Missouri respondents said abortion should be legal in all or most cases. The state’s lawmakers want to impose their religious and personal beliefs about the most intimate of medical decisions a woman can make.The religious right’s self-proclaimed devotion to the unborn would ring more true if these same legislators didn’t consistently disregard people’s access to health care and food benefits for the poor — often critical to keeping people alive. In Missouri, the number of children without health care coverage rose from 71,000 in 2016 to 75,000 in 2017, up about 5.6 percent. Gov. Mike Parson, touting legislators’ “bold stand” for life, is the same man who earlier this year vowed to cut health care spending for the poor.Legislators voted down a proposal last year to have a committee study the factors contributing to the shockingly high number of deaths of mothers during pregnancy and childbirth. Missouri has one of the highest maternal death rates in the country. But those aren’t the lives our state’s lawmakers are rabidly focused on saving."
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri considers trimming impeachment after Greitens' case,"Mar 15, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-considers-trimming-impeachment-after-greitens-case/article_7e4a1a17-8866-5905-8d2b-6940e71cd502.html,"JEFFERSON CITY •  The Missouri Senate is backing an effort that could make it harder to impeach and oust top officials, less than a year after the state’s governor resigned while facing potential impeachment.Senators behind the proposal say it isn’t motivated by the case against former Republican Gov. Eric Greitens. But had the measure been in place last year, House members likely would have been unable to pursue impeachment of Greitens.The proposal would delete the current eight grounds for impeachment — including two of the causes against Greitens, “misconduct” and “moral turpitude” — and instead limit impeachment to “corruption or crime in office.” Under that standard, House members could not have pursued impeachment for allegations of sexual misconduct and campaign finance violations that occurred before Greitens took office in January 2017.

“Had this been the law a year ago, Eric Greitens would still be our governor, despite some pretty egregious behavior,” said Democratic Rep. Gina Mitten, who served on the special House investigatory committee that was weighing whether to impeach Greitens.Greitens resigned June 1, before the panel voted on impeachment, as part of a deal with Circuit Attorney Kimberly M. Gardner to drop a felony charge alleging that he illegally provided a donor list from a veterans charity he founded to his campaign fundraiser in 2015. He was succeeded by Republican Lt. Gov. Mike Parson.Prosecutors also decided not to pursue a charge alleging he took and transmitted a nonconsensual photo of a partially nude woman with whom he admitted having an affair in 2015. The woman testified that Greitens slapped her during a sexual encounter, which Greitens denied.The Senate’s proposed constitutional amendment received initial approval earlier this week. It needs a second Senate vote to go to the House and then would be subject to a statewide vote, likely in the 2020 general election. The change would take effect in 2021.In addition to narrowing the impeachment criteria, the proposal would shift the responsibility for conducting impeachment trials to the Senate instead of judges and would raise the threshold needed to remove an impeached executive branch official.“It would make it a much more rigorous process,” said sponsoring state Sen. Ed Emery, a Republican. “It makes the lasso that you cast to pull in an impeachable offense a little smaller.”Emery added: “I definitely think there was sense that (Greitens) was being mistreated, but I don’t think it had any impact on this” proposed constitutional amendment.Emery said his main objective is to restore the authority for conducting impeachment trials to the Senate, as it had been under an 1875 version of the Missouri Constitution. He has sponsored similar measures in prior years. But to get this year’s version out of the Senate Judiciary and Civil and Criminal Jurisprudence Committee, Emery said he had to agree to narrow the grounds for impeachment.
Committee chairman Sen. Tony Luetkemeyer, a Republican attorney, said he was concerned that lawmakers could have used the broader, current criteria to try to remove judges from office for rulings with which they disagreed.“When you have a generalized, nebulous standard like ‘misconduct,’ well, what is misconduct?” Luetkemeyer asked rhetorically.He added: “What I don’t want to have happen is somebody reach back into a judge’s past — or the past of a statewide elected official — and say something that you did when you were 14 years old, or something that you did whenever you were in college, can then be used and bootstrapped as a basis for removing somebody from office.”
Luetkemeyer was not a member of the Legislature during last year’s investigation into Greitens, though his wife worked as a legal counsel in Greitens’ office.Mitten, who opposes the measure, said it could give politicians a free pass for misconduct before taking office.“You could hypothetically get elected in November, rob a bank December 31st, get sworn in a week later — nothing anybody could do about it,” Mitten said. “It would not be grounds for impeaching him.”Had Greitens been impeached last year by the House, he would have been tried by a panel of seven judges appointed by the Senate that would have needed five votes to remove him from office.The Senate’s proposal would require a three-quarters vote of the Senate to remove a governor or other elected executive official and a two-thirds vote to remove a judge. That provision is backed by Democratic state Sen. Jason Holsman, who said it would ensure bipartisan support while adding “a layer of protection for those elected officials.”Republicans currently hold a greater than two-thirds majority in both the House and Senate but are just shy of the three-fourths mark.“If they’ve done something that rises to the level of impeachment and removal, you would think that it would be near unanimous,” Holsman said.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"With no mention of problems, Missouri governor replaces chief of tax agency","Mar 15, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/with-no-mention-of-problems-missouri-governor-replaces-chief-of/article_88c8a74e-a7e9-5be3-a68d-0db14b1b5a33.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Despite biting criticism from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, Gov. Mike Parson credited his outgoing tax chief Friday for implementing reforms at the Missouri Department of Revenue.In an announcement less than 24 hours after the Post-Dispatch reported the pending resignation of embattled Revenue Director Joel Walters, Parson named Ken Zellers as acting director of the agency that oversees the collection of billions of dollars in income taxes, license plate fees and other revenue in the state.Zellers, a former Anheuser-Busch InBev executive, currently serves as chief operating officer at the department.

Parson said Walters’ two years at the agency were a success.“His leadership and transformative vision helped to turn around the Department of Revenue, leading to increased customer service, identifying efficiencies that led to significant budget savings, and implementing a number of conservative reforms that helped improve and streamline services for Missouri taxpayers,” Parson said.That’s a far cry from the reaction of lawmakers, who have kept Walters on the hot seat for weeks over his admitted mishandling of the implementation of the federal tax cuts.“Missouri taxpayers deserve competency and honesty in their state agencies. The Department of Revenue’s failures and subsequent cover-up will impact the pocketbooks and trust of many Missourians. As legislators, we have a duty to hold bureaucrats accountable when they’re not forthright with the taxpayers, and I’ve never shied away from that,” said Rep. Robert Ross, R-Yukon, who chaired a special committee that probed problems at the agency.“The resignation of the director is an important step forward, but the department has much more work to do to regain the trust of the public. I’ve asked the committee to continue its work in investigating this issue and working with the new director to ensure Missouri taxpayers are protected,” added House Speaker Elijah Haahr, R-Springfield.Walters, who was brought to Missouri to run the taxing agency in 2017 by former Gov. Eric Greitens, weathered months of tough questioning from lawmakers over his role in altering the state’s withholding tables after the federal tax cut went into effect last year.Walters testified several times to the Legislature that the state’s withholding tables didn’t correctly account for the standard deduction — the amount of income taxpayers can subtract before income tax — in calculating the federal income tax deduction. Walters said the withholding error had been discovered in September after existing for at least 15 years.Walters ordered changes to the tables that he believed would reduce the impact of taxpayers withholding too much. The change went into effect in October 2018.In February, he acknowledged that it wasn’t an old error, but a mistake on his part.
The pressure on Walters was amplified Thursday when the Columbia Daily Tribune reported that the Department of Revenue had initially prepared a news release last year cautioning taxpayers to increase their income tax withholdings for the remainder of the year or face the potential of having to pay taxes instead of receiving a refund.Estimates in December show that refunds are expected to drop by $231 million, while payments are expected to increase by $134 million.As lawmakers turned up the heat on Walters, Parson reacted by saying the hearings were “political grandstanding.”Parson’s Republican counterparts in the Legislature said the resignation is proof their actions were not politically motivated.
“I’m proud of the oversight committee for standing up for the hard-working families who may end up with a surprise tax bill this April because the department failed to do its job. Clearly, the committee was not grandstanding, but instead was standing up for the people of our state,” said House Floor Leader Rob Vescovo, R-Arnold.House Minority Leader Crystal Quade, D-Springfield, said Walters’ departure does not absolve Parson for his role in the department’s meltdown.“The resignation of Director Walters is just a first step that must include Governor Parson taking full responsibility for his administration’s failures and committing to providing relief to those Missourians who are in a financial bind as a result,” Quade said.Parson spokesman Steele Shippy defended the governor.“Typical democrat socialist response, advocating that the government take more money from hardworking Missourians paychecks, while Governor Parson works to ensure all Missourians benefit from historical federal and state tax cuts,” he said in response to Quade.Walters, who earned $128,200 annually, plans to leave the agency on March 22.“I appreciate the opportunity of working alongside Governor Parson and his administration. They are doing fantastic things for the citizens of Missouri, and I am extremely proud that I have played a part in that success,” he said in a statement.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Messenger: Missouri Republicans get new rallying cry for gun-porn legislation: Not a Good Choice,"Mar 15, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/columns/tony-messenger/messenger-missouri-republicans-get-new-rallying-cry-for-gun-porn/article_aae650c7-708f-57e2-b1cd-b456d785a77e.html,"Missouri Republicans advancing gun-porn legislation on behalf of the Russians, er, the National Rifle Association, have a new name for their effort.Put them all in one big bill and call them: Not a Good Choice.Those were the words of an intoxicated Republican Senate staffer after police responded to an incident in a Jefferson City bar in the early morning hours last week.

As first reported by the Post-Dispatch’s Kurt Erickson, Jared Brown, who is the chief of staff to Sen. Justin Brown, R-Rolla, was involved in a barroom altercation when a loaded 9 mm Ruger pistol he was carrying fell to the ground.When police arrived at Spectators Bar and Grill, a “visibly intoxicated” Brown acknowledged that bringing the gun into the bar was “not a good choice.”Ya think?And yet, it seems, most Republicans in the Missouri Legislature want to make that choice easier. In a passel of bills filed this year mostly intended to inoculate members of the GOP from primary challenges on the right, lawmakers are pushing legislation that would make it easier to bring guns into bars, churches and businesses, onto college campuses, into schools, and yes, into day care centers.There’s even a bill that would require every adult in Missouri between the ages of 18 and 35 to own an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle, the assault weapon of choice among mass shooters in this country. I assumed the bill was a joke, a satire meant to draw attention to the surreal nature of the gun debate in the Show-Me state, but the legislative assistant of the sponsor, Rep. Andrew McDaniel, R-Deering, assures me it is a real, serious bill.McDaniel, a former deputy sheriff in Pemiscot County, also has filed a bill that would require every adult in Missouri who can legally possess a firearm to purchase one.Both bills require the state to make a tax credit available for the purchase of such guns. What a deal. Cut poor kids off of Medicaid at a rate higher than any state in the nation, but make sure their parents and teachers and day care providers have guns and assault weapons.It’s Obamacare for guns, but without any of the health benefits.
Not a Good Choice.When it comes to the often obscene nature of Missouri’s gun debate, it helps to consider gun bills in context — not just the late-night context of what gun-toting lawmakers and their aides are up to while getting drunk in the capital city — but the context of other legislation they are proposing.Take college campuses, for instance. An effort pushed by lobbyist Richard McIntosh and now 19 other lobbyists, and funded at least in part by St. Louis billionaire David Steward, who is a trustee of Washington University, would gut Title IX protections for women who have reported being sexually assaulted. Every major university, private and public, in Missouri, opposes the legislation, as do advocates for women. They say it will have a chilling effect on women reporting such assaults and seeking protection from campus officials.
Now, if the gun-porn advocates have their way, campus rapists will also be well armed.So, too, will the day care workers that Gov. Mike Parson and Attorney General Eric Schmitt want to investigate for allegedly holding a “fight club” among the children in their care.Surely adding guns to that mix will make Missouri a safer place.Or maybe that, too, would not be a good choice.It turns out, Brown might not have actually meant those words when he used them in talking to Jefferson City police last week. Later in the conversation, according to the police report, he said, “I wish my gun was closer — I woulda used it.”Of course, if McDaniel has his way, next time Brown walks into Spectators, he’ll also have an AR-15 by his side.It’s the choice of intoxicated bar brawlers everywhere.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri's embattled tax chief is leaving under cloud,"Mar 15, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-s-embattled-tax-chief-is-leaving-under-cloud/article_7c6eb3f7-65fb-5ba2-b484-11e56fad081d.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • With just a month to go before the deadline for Missourians to pay their income taxes, the state’s embattled director of the Department of Revenue is departing under a cloud, the Post-Dispatch has learned.Joel Walters, who was brought to Missouri to run the taxing agency in 2017 by former Gov. Eric Greitens, is expected to be replaced Friday by Gov. Mike Parson. Walters weathered months of tough questioning from lawmakers over his role in altering the state’s withholding tables after the federal tax cut went into effect last year.Walters, who earned $128,200 in 2018, was not available Thursday, an agency official said.















Joel Walters was named director of revenue in 2017 by former Gov. Eric Greitens.  


Walters testified several times to the Legislature that the state’s withholding tables didn’t correctly account for the standard deduction — the amount of income taxpayers can subtract before income tax— in calculating the federal income tax deduction. Walters said the withholding error had been discovered in September after existing for at least 15 years.Walters ordered changes to the tables that he believed would reduce the impact of taxpayers withholding too much. The change went into effect in October 2018.In February, he acknowledged that it wasn’t an old error, but a mistake on his part.It was not immediately clear whether Parson asked Walters to step down. His departure follows the governor’s defense of Walters, saying lawmakers who were holding the hearings were guilty of political grandstanding.The pressure on Walters was amplified Thursday when the Columbia Daily Tribune reported that the Department of Revenue had initially prepared a news release last year cautioning taxpayers to increase their income tax withholdings for the remainder of the year or face the potential of having to pay taxes instead of receiving a refund.House Minority Leader Crystal Quade, D-Springfield, said the director’s departure “in no way absolves Governor Mike Parson and top members of his administration for their roles in this debacle.”
“The resignation of Director Walters is just a first step that must include Governor Parson taking full responsibility for his administration’s failures and committing to providing relief to those Missourians who are in a financial bind as a result,” Quade said.Republican lawmakers also said it was time for Walters to go.
“I believe that Mr. Walters made the right decision. Due to the withholding error and the changing story provided to lawmakers, he had lost a lot of trust not just in the Capitol, but also amongst the people of our state who saw drastic changes in their tax bills,” said Rep. Nick Schroer, R-O’Fallon.The apparent missteps by Walters won’t affect how much people actually pay in taxes, but they will affect refunds and tax payments for the 2018 tax year.Estimates in December show that refunds are expected to drop by $231 million, while payments are expected to increase by $134 million.The director’s woes also have played a role in the state budget process because people who owe money are taking longer to pay their tax bills.Through Friday, state general revenue was down 5.5 percent for the year, with income tax collections down $463.8 million, or 9.4 percent.Late tax bill payments might prevent the state from reaching its goal of seeing revenue increase by 1.7 percent, if the state collects the money in fiscal 2020 instead of 2019.Prior to working for the state, Walters was a business tax consultant based in New York and Washington.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Chamber calls on members to help boost area education,"Mar 14, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/business/local/chamber-calls-on-members-to-help-boost-area-education/article_0bffc827-f9c9-5109-b543-bfa06ddfd5e7.html,"Two-thirds of area employers don’t work with local educational or training organization outfits to skill up or recruit the talent they need. An additional 10 percent don’t know if they do.That’s one of the key takeaways from a new workforce survey of 260 firms released by the St. Louis Regional Chamber at an event Thursday. And that has to change, said Chamber President and CEO Tom Chulick.“This is a supply issue,” he said. “We need more people to come to the door of educational institutions.”

The survey, conducted by national organization the Graduate Network with a grant from the Walmart Foundation, is part of a Chamber effort to engage the private sector to take a bigger, bolder role in workforce development and higher education attainment.














        
            Coaching model could help St. Louis area adults finish their college degrees

For many former students, going back to school comes with challenges. Transcripts could be on hold for past-due balances, or the school where they started no longer exists. 




The Chamber announced several new initiatives as part of the effort, including a campaign to recruit students at colleges within 250 miles of St. Louis through internships at area businesses and a planned scholarship fund to help workers finish degrees they’ve started but didn’t finish due to financial reasons.The workforce push comes amid a tight labor market due to a strong economy. Missouri Gov. Mike Parson has made workforce development one of his top priorities.The Missouri House last month passed his Fast Track program, which sought $22 million to provide tuition assistance for adults who want to return to school and train for hard-to-fill jobs.While Chamber officials praised the governor’s program, Chulick said the private sector in the region also needs to step up.“This is business-led,” Chulick said. “We aren’t able to wait for the legislative process to give us the guidance to move ahead.”Dennis Hummel, vice chairman of Fenton-based Maritz, implored the area’s businesses to get involved with local educational institutions and talk to faculty there about curriculum and training needs.“We’re not going to solve this problem through government,” he said. “Business has to get involved.”














        
            Missouri House gives green light to governor's 'Fast Track' jobs program

Gov. Mike Parson wants to offer people 25 and older free tuition for training in high-demand jobs.





A region’s economic strength is closely tied to the skills and education of its workforce, even more so in the knowledge-based economy of today. Metro areas with loads of smart workers such as San Francisco and Boston continue to grow despite far higher costs of living than many locales.Higher educational attainment not only benefits the region, but individual businesses that offer incentives to employees often see returns in better employee retention, said Dan Ash, research director at the Graduate Network.In St. Louis, which often touts plant science and medical research among its strongest industry clusters, the top jobs respondents to the survey said were hardest to fill were engineers, scientists and high-skilled medical professionals.
Over 40 percent of businesses in the survey said they’ll need more employees with bachelor’s degrees in the next five years. Nearly one-third said they’ll need more workers with advanced degrees.About 34 percent of the St. Louis region’s population has a bachelor’s degree or higher, slightly above the national average of 31 percent, according to St. Louis Community College’s 2018 regional workforce survey.In late 2017, the Chamber launched an initiative, Gateway to Degrees, aiming to boost the region’s educational attainment by connecting adults with resources and coaching to get them into college.














        
            Tech skill warning: If firms can't find workers here, they'll go elsewhere

61 percent of technology employers say they face shortage of skilled applicants




On Thursday, it also announced it was seeking to bring on partners to form the St. Louis Regional Finish Line Fund, which would provide scholarships and financial assistance to adults who are close to finishing their degrees but didn’t finish for financial reasons. There’s an estimated 22 percent of the area’s population that has some college but no degree, according to the St. Louis Community College report.And the Chamber’s new Project 250 pilot program would get staff to colleges both in St. Louis and in smaller towns outside of the region to promote St. Louis and draw talent. What the Chamber needs is about 10 to 15 companies to participate by offering internship positions that the Chamber can help fill with students.“To a kid from Little Rock, Ark., St. Louis looks pretty grown-up and sexy,” said Valerie Patton, the Chamber’s vice president of inclusion and talent attraction, who’s leading Project 250.It’s not just internships for college students, Chulick said. Businesses need to be going into local high schools — even middle schools — to tell students about the career path to their companies.“We’ve got to do a lot better job letting the student population know there’s opportunity here,” he said.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Hiring people with disabilities is a win for all,"Mar 14, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/columnists/hiring-people-with-disabilities-is-a-win-for-all/article_039e3b9a-bbd2-5015-b82d-9c21e524f338.html,"The largest untapped workforce in our booming economy is made up of people with disabilities. As a premier provider for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities, St. Louis Arc is pleased to see the progress in inclusive hiring that is happening in the St. Louis region and across Missouri. We applaud Gov. Mike Parson’s effort through the Employment First initiative to advocate for additional funding to support employer growth and successful employment of people with disabilities. And while we are on track to becoming a model employer state for individuals with disabilities, there is still much more to be done to ensure that people with disabilities have services to help them gain meaningful, independent employment.Partnerships forged among employment service providers, local and state legislators and state funders are paramount to the success of disability employment opportunities and inclusion overall. St. Louis Arc has begun to develop relationships with state Rep. Sarah Unsicker, D-Shrewsbury; St. Louis Alderman Christine Ingrassia; and St. Louis County Councilwoman Lisa Clancy to help move forward bills and resolutions that address inclusion and employment at the local level. We are encouraged that more people in positions of civic and political leadership recognize the need for inclusion and employment support for those with disabilities.Even with support and new initiatives, the message of hiring people with disabilities only truly works when we get buy-in from employers, even if it is one employer at a time. It’s only when employers see the benefits that a person with a disability can bring to their business that true success can take place for the employer and the employee. Employers tapping into the disability workforce have already recognized many benefits, including lower turnover rates, increased productivity, employer brand enhancement and the financial benefit of potential tax credits.

As a nonprofit organization, St. Louis Arc empowers people with intellectual and developmental disabilities and their families to lead better lives by providing a lifetime of high-quality services, family support and advocacy. This includes assisting people with finding and retaining meaningful employment and helping employers understand the benefits of hiring someone with a disability.
St. Louis Arc’s employment services team provides skills assessment, job coaching and ongoing retention services to more than 350 people with disabilities annually. We also work with approximately 180 employers throughout the St. Louis area, helping them to develop and maintain inclusive hiring practices. This service is a win-win for everyone involved.Making a good job match is the underlying philosophy of employment success for all people with and without disabilities. Statistically, there are 56 million people in America with disabilities, and 84 percent are unemployed — which makes them the largest untapped pool of talent in the nation. A typical business can slash turnover rates and achieve significant cost savings by taking advantage of this proven dependable workforce. We encourage businesses not to overlook qualified individuals because of perceived limitations.
While some people may see limitations, service providers such as St. Louis Arc see untapped potential and opportunities for growth and inclusion for people with disabilities.Brian Hubler is director of employment and transition services for St. Louis Arc. 10 years. In 2016, was named Missouri Rehabilitation Association’s Administrator of the Year."
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Editorial: Parson and the Legislature should try again to ask voters for a fuel tax hike.,"Mar 12, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-parson-and-the-legislature-should-try-again-to-ask/article_590e33cc-4e65-5457-919c-8c6cad7ca439.html,"It’s good that Gov. Mike Parson is proactively addressing Missouri transportation infrastructure issues that are approaching an emergency situation. And his proposal to borrow toward fixing it isn’t intrinsically unreasonable.But he is too quickly ruling out another go at the voters to raise the state’s fuel tax — by far the smartest way to fund this. Parson says voters had spoken “loud and clear” by defeating that idea last year. However, there was nothing “clear” about the muddled ballot measure that failed. Voters should get another shot at doing this right.The fuel tax is the best approach to funding roads because the taxes are paid by those who drive the highways, including out-of-staters passing through. But Missouri last raised its fuel tax, to the current 17 cents a gallon, in 1996. It’s now among the lowest rates in America and far below what’s needed. The state’s highway infrastructure is crumbling under two decades of fiscal neglect.

Much of that system is 50 years beyond its original life expectancy. Almost one in 10 bridges are rated in poor condition. Studies show such infrastructure neglect has had real economic costs, to say nothing of the obvious safety implications.The Legislature tried to address it last year with Proposition D, asking voters to raise the fuel tax by 2.5 cents per year until it hits 27 cents in mid-2022. Despite the overwhelming need for it, and bipartisan promotion from Parson and leading Democrats, voters decisively defeated it.
But as this newspaper and others have argued, that result doesn’t appear to have been a vote against adequately funding roads as much as a reaction to a poorly worded, badly explained ballot measure.
The wording was so convoluted that it made it look as if much of the new money was going to the Missouri Highway Patrol instead of roads. That wasn’t the case — the Highway Patrol was just a funding pass-through — but a reasonable reading of the ballot didn’t make that clear. This likely wasn’t a case of a bad idea or even an unpopular one, just a poorly executed one.Nonetheless, in the wake of that ballot defeat, it would be unacceptable for the Legislature to pass a fuel tax hike now. Lawmakers should have done that first, but that car has left the off-ramp.What they still can do is try again to convince the voters this has to be done, with clear and unmistakable ballot language. Parson’s alternative plan to borrow $350 million to address the problem is already drawing legislative opposition, and in any case wouldn’t provide the continuing revenue stream that’s needed.Voters would do the right thing if they’re given the information in a clear and persuasive way. Parson and the Legislature should get back to the drawing board on this one."
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Affton lawmaker set to seek Senate seat covering swath of St. Louis County,"Mar 12, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/affton-lawmaker-set-to-seek-senate-seat-covering-swath-of/article_e6b5fc05-d2ba-57f0-9312-2a4e46e8e991.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • A two-term member of the Missouri House will kick off his campaign on Saturday for a seat in the state Senate.Rep. Doug Beck, D-Affton, has scheduled a fundraiser at the Affton Elks Club on Saturday as he begins his bid to replace term-limited Sen. Scott Sifton in the Legislature’s upper chamber.

State Rep. Doug Beck, D-Affton 






Sifton, who has represented the 1st Senate District since 2012, announced earlier that he will run for governor in 2020.A possible Beck opponent could be former Rep. Marsha Haefner, a Republican who served eight years representing the Oakville area and could not run again because of term limits.“I’m still considering it. But I will make a decision very soon,” said Haefner, who is now working in Gov. Mike Parson’s St. Louis office as a liaison for the chief executive.Beck has represented the 92nd District in the House since 2017, after he beat Republican Daniel Bogle.
He cruised to re-election last year with 60 percent of the vote over Republican Bill Heisse.
Beck, a union pipefitter for more than 30 years, is a St. Louis area native who graduated from Lindbergh High School and attended St. Louis Community College.In an earlier announcement, Beck said he’s looking forward to serving in a chamber with fewer members.“An individual can make more of a difference as a state senator where, with just 34 members, more time can be devoted to serious debate and finding areas of bipartisan agreement where progress can be made,” Beck said.The House has 163 members.The district boundaries stretch from the Oakville area north to Brentwood. The seat had been in Republican hands until Sifton won the post.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri officials form task force to study futuristic tube travel project,"Mar 12, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-officials-form-task-force-to-study-futuristic-tube-travel/article_09a5d3f4-ae2d-55a3-870f-c69883b46110.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Missouri officials are forming a high-level task force to determine whether it’s feasible to build a high-speed, people-moving link between St. Louis and Kansas City.Although the technology for a so-called “hyperloop” remains unproven, House Speaker Elijah Haahr,  R-Springfield, launched the panel Tuesday, saying Missouri could establish itself as the “global epicenter” for research and development of the experimental project.“We are early in the process, but ahead of the game when it comes to this issue,” Haahr said.

In October, Kansas City-based engineering company Black & Veatch said the pneumatic tube transportation line that would transport passengers along the 250-mile expanse between the two anchor cities in less than 30 minutes would be feasible to build.The company estimated the cost of running the line somewhat parallel to Interstate 70 at between $7 billion and $10 billion.Lt. Gov. Mike Kehoe, a former senator and chairman of the Missouri Highways and Transportation Commission, will chair the task force.“We are a state that has the ingenuity, technology, the resources to look at what’s next in the future,” Kehoe said.But, Kehoe added he would not support spending state money on the project until the state has figured out how to fund its current backlog of road and bridge projects.Other members of the panel include Senate Majority Leader Caleb Rowden, R-Columbia, Sen. Brian Williams, D-University City, and University of Missouri President Mun Choi.
Talks about bringing the technology to Missouri has been in the public eye since the state unveiled its now-failed bid to lure Amazon's second headquarters to the state in 2017.As part of the package, state officials said Amazon could build in both St. Louis and Kansas City and be linked by the hyperloop.The seed for the committee was apparently planted in December by the St. Louis Regional Chamber, which is spearheading the effort. In emails obtained by the Post-Dispatch, Austin Walker, director of governmental affairs for the chamber, sought to enlist Gov. Mike Parson to attend a January meeting at the hyperloop testing grounds in Nevada.
“Obviously, the governor’s participation would be incredibly helpful,” Walker wrote.Later, after the meeting in the desert was postponed, Walker told Parson chief of staff Aaron Willard that he’d approached Haahr about creating the task force.“I have asked the speaker if he would be willing to consider a special committee to look into and strengthen the Missouri proposal, and he was very supportive of the idea,” Walker wrote.Also working behind the scenes is Steve Tilley, a former speaker of the Missouri House who serves as a lobbyist for Heartland Hyperloop Inc.Over the next several months, the committee will hold public meetings in St. Louis, Jefferson City, and Kansas City. The group will present its findings in September.“This is a chance for Missouri to position itself as a global tech leader,” said task force member Andrew Smith of the St. Louis Regional Chamber. “Bringing this technology to Missouri would serve as a powerful talent magnet and a significant boost for our technology, logistics, and manufacturing sectors.”

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri House Democrats criticize plan to borrow for roads,"Mar 11, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/state-and-regional/missouri-house-democrats-criticize-plan-to-borrow-for-roads/article_7afc02af-8bab-5b94-84f9-d6ff15eb0a59.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • A top Democratic lawmaker Monday said Republican Gov. Mike Parson's plan to borrow $350 million to repair bridges across the state is a ""nonstarter.""Rep. Kip Kendrick, the top Democrat on the influential House Budget Committee, told reporters that House Democrats generally oppose using un-earmarked general revenue to fund infrastructure.Road and bridge work has previously been funded primarily through the state's gas tax, federal funding and fees.

Under Parson's plan , the state would repay the $350-million loan with general revenue in $30-million-a-year payments over 15 years. The state would owe an estimated $100 million in interest.""It's no disrespect to the governor, he wanted to put a proposal out there that started the conversation,"" Kendrick said. ""I just think that proposal is a nonstarter.""House Democrats have limited power in Missouri's Republican-led Legislature. Their opposition is notable because it comes as other factions of lawmakers are also moving away from Parson's plan and shifting to other possible sources of infrastructure funding.
Republican House Committee Chairman Cody Smith instead pitched setting aside $100 million in general revenue each year for road and bridge work, a plan that earned support from the Senate's Conservative Caucus.Kendrick said that plan won't provide enough money to adequately address infrastructure maintenance for the state. He urged colleagues to consider long-term funding solutions, such as toll roads or asking voters again to increase the gas tax.
Kendrick said $100 million is significant, but ""it does not get anywhere close to addressing this long-term problem.""Parson spokesman Steele Shippy said the governor is sticking by his priority to fund infrastructure but noted that voters last year defeated a proposal to raise the state's 17-cent gas tax to 27 cents per gallon.""The people of Missouri spoke loud and clear about their position on an increase in the fuel tax,"" Parson said. ""The governor believes it's our job as leaders to find solutions to meet our critical infrastructure needs.""

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri faces a $118 million bill for prison guards' back pay as House finishes budget work,"Mar 11, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-faces-a-million-bill-for-prison-guards-back-pay/article_d7f4f290-c420-58ac-8544-7c3ca43c6040.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • The Missouri House Budget Committee on Monday was still processing news that the state would need to pay $118 million in back pay to employees of the Department of Corrections.House Budget Committee Chairman Cody Smith, R-Carthage, said it was too early to comment on the Thursday order from Cole County Circuit Judge Patricia Joyce.Joyce ordered the garnishment of $118 million from the state after officials failed to pay the amount, which stemmed from a lawsuit brought by guards for unpaid overtime.

But Treasurer Scott Fitzpatrick said the money could not be paid because there is no appropriation for legal costs large enough to cover the payment — setting up a dispute between a Legislature and an executive branch that have not budgeted the money, and the courts.In August, a jury awarded corrections officers more than $113.7 million after they claimed the Department of Corrections had not paid them overtime. The verdict included a provision for an interest charge if the state didn’t pay immediately.That has added nearly $5 million to the state’s cost.Attorney Gary Burger, who represents the officers, has filed a motion to hold the department in contempt. A hearing has been set for April 1.Burger told the Post-Dispatch that the state has not responded to attempts to determine why the money hasn’t been paid.“There have been no discussions with the state,” Burger said.In addition to paying the guards, the state also was required to install a timekeeping system to better track hours worked by the officers. That has not occurred.Rep. Kip Kendrick, of Columbia, the ranking Democrat on the budget panel, said he expected the state would appeal the $113.7 million ruling. He said that it was possible the state would have to pay out the money next fiscal year, however.“The process and the payment is far from being resolved at this point,” Kendrick said.Gov. Mike Parson, in his budget plan, set aside $117 million for “future budget emergencies.” Kendrick said that line item would likely be used if the state fails to meet revenue estimates. He said at least part of it could be used for the Department of Corrections settlement.
“I imagine that some of that money is in preparation for a payment that will likely — that could very well likely happen sometime in fiscal year ’20,” Kendrick said.House Minority Leader Crystal Quade, D-Springfield, said it might be too early to pay the money because the state could still appeal the case.“We generally agree with the treasurer,” Quade said.
But, she said the state eventually would have to pay the bill.“The reality is we owe this money to our employees,” Quade said.The House Budget Committee on Monday was also putting the finishing touches on its blueprint for the state’s $30 billion budget for next fiscal year, which starts July 1.Smith said last week he would earmark $100 million in general revenue for road and bridge projects next fiscal year, instead of going along with Parson’s plan to borrow $350 million for bridge projects.Kendrick and Democrats said they were skeptical of both proposals. Kendrick said he would like voters to approve a higher gasoline tax, but Republicans, who control the Legislature, have expressed little enthusiasm for putting a tax increase proposal before voters.The committee on Monday voted down several Democratic amendments that would have diverted money from an $18 million appropriation for Parson’s Fast Track scholarship program.A House subcommittee had already skimmed about $4 million from the program for other priorities. Parson had originally requested $22 million for the scholarships.The House voted down an amendment that would move $500,000 from the governor’s proposed Fast Track program to Harris-Stowe State University. They also voted down a Democratic-backed amendment to move $2.5 million from Fast Track to Parents as Teachers.Once the House Budget Committee approves the spending plan, it will move to the full House, and then the Senate, for consideration.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Budding medical marijuana business attracts hopefuls from across Missouri – and beyond,"Mar 11, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/budding-medical-marijuana-business-attracts-hopefuls-from-across-missouri-and/article_4a69cc3c-2f82-54c8-945d-932c656f3307.html,"Tawion Jackson considered the $250 he paid for a more-than-three-hour workshop on how to break into Missouri’s budding medical marijuana industry an investment.“It’s a significant jump, but that’s the jump I need,” said Jackson, 42, of Bellefontaine Neighbors. “You never know until you try.”Jackson, a Xerox employee who fixes copying machines, was one of at least 74 people attending the session Feb. 18, including established business owners and those looking to build a new career in a tightly regulated business that is estimated to generate millions in revenue for groups that win state approval for one of about 335 licenses to grow marijuana, make infused products like oils or edibles, or sell them.

Workshop attendees paid a Colorado consulting firm, Canna Advisors, to learn how to do just that. The firm’s owners, Jay and Diane Czarkowski, operated one of the first dispensaries in Boulder, Colo., and say they’ve since helped win licenses for dozens of companies in 29 states.














        
            More than 20 companies vying to score medical marijuana contracts with Missouri



The Department of Health and Senior Services has been hosting public forums to hear questions from Missourians, while state officials write the rules for the industry and the license applications. They plan to finish that process June 4. The state won’t accept business applications until Aug. 3.Meanwhile, the industry is buzzing with activity. State associations and business groups in and out-of-state are hosting conferences and workshops on medical marijuana and ancillary industries. The Missouri Cannabis Trade Association has a two-day conference Monday and Tuesday featuring panel discussions and workshops including the Czarkowskis and more than a dozen other companies.The state has raked in at least $3.1 million from at least 434 pre-filed medical marijuana business applications since Jan. 5, but is keeping the identities of the filers secret. The Post-Dispatch has sued Gov. Mike Parson’s administration to release their identities.Canna Advisors, which already has clients in Missouri, is one of dozens of out-of-state companies cashing in on the emerging market. Like Canna, several got their start in Colorado, one of the earlier states to legalize medical and recreational marijuana, and donated to the campaign to legalize medical marijuana in Missouri.Department of Health and Senior Services officials are talking with groups from in and out of Missouri and reviewing other states’ regulations, department director, Dr. Randall Williams, told a crowd of more than 100 people at a Feb. 23 seminar in St. Charles, hosted by the Missouri Cannabis Industry Association.“Especially in a startup like this that’s brand new for us and the state, we just think we’ll get to a better place in Missouri if we listen to many people who have been involved in this for a longer time,” Williams said in his opening address.Williams responded to nearly an hour of wide-ranging questions.Robert Powell, a Columbia resident with the mid-Missouri chapter of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, said he was concerned about “big companies” shutting out locals.“How seriously are you guys looking into the backgrounds of out-of-state investors coming in and basically stealing opportunities from residents of Missouri?” asked Powell, a security guard who said he is interested in applying for a manufacturing license. Several people in the crowd nodded at his question.Missouri law requires any entity seeking a license to have at least 51 percent ownership by someone who has lived in the state for at least one year before applying. It prohibits any company from operating more than three cultivation facilities, five dispensaries or three medical marijuana-infused manufacturing facilities. Each license would have to be earned individually.Williams also pointed to a provision of the medical marijuana law requiring Missouri officials to review “the character, veracity, background, qualifications and relevant experience” of license applicants’ “principal officers and managers.” He said each license would have to be approved individually.
License problemsIn 2014, the Czarkowkis worked with several companies in Massachusetts that were applying for medical marijuana licenses. Three of the four companies that were approved for licenses listed Jay or Diane Czarkowksi on their executive management teams.Their involvement came under fire after the Boston Globe published a report revealing that their cultivation and dispensary operation, Boulder Kind Care, lasted three years before its license was revoked in 2012 for numerous violations.Boulder Kind Care was founded in 2009 and was among about 150 medical marijuana businesses in legal operation when the city required them in 2010 to apply for medical marijuana-specific licenses. Only about 75 met the requirements, said Mishawn Cook, licensing manager for Boulder.According to Boulder city records, the violations included that Boulder Kind Care lied to obtain a construction permit to expand operations, did not have security cameras, didn’t properly store records, stored marijuana in unauthorized areas and had alcohol on the premises. Diane Czarkowski filed for bankruptcy the next year, leaving behind more than $400,000 in debt for luxury purchases, according to federal bankruptcy documents.The Czarkowskis’ Canna Advisors staff did not tell the paying participants at their St. Louis workshop that they had lost their licenses. In an interview with the Post-Dispatch, the couple played down the violations and said they were victims of a “zero tolerance” approach from a city trying to rein in a new industry.
“Not only were there no rules nor regulations, but this had never been done before,” Jay Czarkowski said. “No one knew how to do it.”Brenda McNoughton wished the Czarkowkis had been “more forthcoming,” but thought their workshop was informative, she said after learning about the revocations from a Post-Dispatch reporter.“I think I would’ve wanted them to be more upfront with it and say, ‘Hey, this has been our experience, and that’s why we’re doing this, to help you avoid the same mistakes we made,’” said McNoughton, who with her husband runs a business that makes drying systems. Two years ago they started selling the equipment to marijuana facilities.Jack Cardetti, a spokesman with the Missouri Medical Cannabis Trade Association, said he did not know the details of Boulder Kind Care’s history and could not comment on Canna Advisors specifically. He said that companies from the 32 states that previously legalized medical or recreational marijuana had experiences that could translate to Missouri.“It’s important for any Missourian to vet any of these companies, but there clearly are some international companies that have a pretty good track record of helping clients put together and win licenses in other states,” he said.Dan Viets, a Columbia lawyer and longtime medical marijuana advocate, helped write the ballot initiative that is now law. He also heads the Missouri Cannabis Industry Association. He said that Canna Advisors were generally well regarded in the industry and that it was difficult for companies in the early days of the medical marijuana industry to comply with regulations.But he cautioned cannabis business hopefuls to choose carefully in seeking help, because there is no requirement that anyone pay for consultants or partner with an outside company.“There are a lot of folks coming from out of state who claim to have expertise in the industry, but the truth is that Missouri’s program is unique, and I think that people would be best served to keep that in mind — that just because they know about licensing in Colorado doesn’t mean that they know how things are going to work in Missouri.”Powell said the state should write the regulations and application in a way that is simple enough for people to understand.“There are a lot of con artists out there,” he said. “It shouldn’t take somebody having to hire a lawyer or somebody from outside just to apply for a license.”

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Dark-money group tied to St. Louis billionaire hires 15 lobbyists to push Title IX changes,"Mar 8, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/dark-money-group-tied-to-st-louis-billionaire-hires-lobbyists/article_d4d87178-2f79-561e-9ae7-2b87784fef8f.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • A dark-money group advocating for changes to how colleges and universities handle sexual misconduct claims has hired more than a dozen lobbyists to patrol the halls of the Missouri Capitol.According to the Missouri Ethics Commission, Kingdom Principles Inc. on Tuesday hired three lobbyists: Doug Nelson and Heath Clarkston of Lathrop Gage Consulting; and Kurt Schaefer, former Republican state senator from Columbia.On Thursday, the group added 10 more lobbyists to its rolls, including James Harris, who is an ally to Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican.

The group had previously hired Richard McIntosh and Matthew Alsager to push for changes to Missouri law.Records show that one of the lobbyists hired, Kyna Iman, ended her association with the group Friday, bringing down to 14 the number of lobbyists working for Kingdom Principles.According to the MEC, five of the lobbyists work for Flotron & McIntosh LLC, whose co-founder Richard McIntosh has represented St. Louis County-based World Wide Technology in the Legislature since 2000.World Wide Technology was founded by St. Louis billionaire David Steward in 1990. Steward is at least partially funding Kingdom Principles.Kingdom Principles is funding the Missouri Campus Due Process Coalition.Because of Kingdom Principles' status as a 501(c)(4) nonprofit, it does not have to reveal its donors, but a spokesman for the group confirmed Steward's involvement this week.
Such lobbyist hiring sprees are not uncommon for entities who have interests before the state. Better Together, the group seeking a merger between St. Louis County and the city of St. Louis, has also hired a squadron of lobbyists, for example.The show of force comes as public and private colleges around the state — and some associated student groups — continue to blast the pending legislation that would afford those facing discipline by college officials more hearing room privileges. 














        
            Two advocates for Title IX changes want cases routed to their wives’ courtroom

""It unquestionably creates a perceived conflict,"" said Rep. Gina Mitten of Richmond Heights, who is the ranking Democrat on the House committee considering the measure. 





The measure would allow either party to a complaint to transfer their case out of their school and to the state Administrative Hearing Commission, a formal process that would open complaints up to public scrutiny. Most Title IX complaints are handled informally, officials say.The legislation also would potentially allow the accused to sue the accuser if the accuser's claims are not proven. The accused could also sue their school for damages if that person's due process rights are not upheld, among other changes.Proponents say the changes are necessary to ensure a fair process for both parties, but opponents say the changes would discourage victims from coming forward. Opponents are also worried a new state law would conflict with federal rules that are in the works.The Senate version of the legislation is scheduled to be debated before the full chamber next week, while the House version is still pending in committee.The legislation is House Bill 573 and Senate Bill 259.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Editorial: Short takes on charity, kindness, meanness and the weirdness of R. Kelly","Mar 8, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-short-takes-on-charity-kindness-meanness-and-the-weirdness/article_85007be7-33f3-5142-b196-e1a45383872c.html,"Keeping Josiah on the moveThe thief who made off with a 3-year-old’s prosthetic leg deserves all the scorn society can heap on him or her. Chances are, the person had no idea what was inside the backpack that his mother, Brie Rainey, inadvertently left inside her car as she carried her sleeping daughter into their Belleville apartment last week. It was akin to a smash ’n’ grab. But at some point, the thief opened the backpack and realized that it contained a small child’s prosthetic leg. Even for the lowest of lowlifes, that’s the moment when a good conscience is supposed to take over and compel the thief to return the item to its owner.The leg belonged to Rainey’s 3-year-old son, Josiah, who was born with multiple birth defects that included a missing left leg. A $10,000, custom-made prosthetic leg allowed him to walk. Without it, Josiah lost what little mobility he had.

But Shriners Hospitals for Children stepped forward to announce that it would replace the prosthetic. Josiah was measured on Monday, and a new one should arrive shortly. Shriners Hospitals for Children has 22 nonprofit hospitals across the country, many of which provide orthopedic care for children regardless of their ability to pay. Sadly, Shriners hasn’t developed a prosthetic conscience for those sorely in need of one.‘I’m not Lucifer’Grammy-winning artist R. Kelly came unglued in an interview that was slated to air Friday on “CBS This Morning.” The interview was his first since being charged with sexual abuse last month. Kelly also was arrested in Chicago for failing to pay more than $160,000 in child support. So, clearly, there’s a lot weighing on his mind.When interviewer Gayle King attempted to drill down on specifics about the sexual abuse charge, Kelly exploded over all the wild accusations flying his way: “Got little girls trapped in the basement ... helicopters over my house trying to rescue someone that doesn’t need rescuing because they’re not in my house,” he said. “Handcuffing people, starving people. I have a harem, what you call it — a cult. I don’t even really know what a cult is. But I know I don’t have one.”He continued: “Everybody says something bad about me. Nobody said nothin’ good. They was describing Lucifer. I’m not Lucifer. I’m a man. I make mistakes, but I’m not a devil, and by no means am I a monster.”He stood up and began flailing his arms, hovering menacingly over King while shouting toward the camera. King flinched and braced as Kelly appeared to lose control. His publicist intervened. Not exactly the display of calm self-control Kelly’s handlers were hoping for to repair his tattered public image.An easy Medicaid fixMissouri cancels Medicaid coverage when recipients are incarcerated, since their medical needs will be handled by the state. But after they’re free, they have to reapply to get their Medicaid coverage back, with the usual paperwork and long wait times. Inevitably, there’s a gap in their medical coverage.
A bill before the Legislature would change that so Medicaid coverage is suspended but not canceled. Newly released inmates who have mental health issues can wait more than a month during the Medicaid re-enrollment process before they’re again eligible for their medication. For some, it means mental breakdowns that can lead them right back into jail.As the Post-Dispatch’s Blythe Bernhard reported, at least 35 other states already take the cost-free, commonsense approach of suspending rather than canceling inmates’ Medicaid. The Legislature and Gov. Mike Parson should get this change on the books as soon as possible.Bigotry on display
A poster displayed at a Republican Party event in the West Virginia state Capitol featured a picture of the burning World Trade Center interposed with an image of Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., one of Congress’ first Muslim members. The poster showed the burning towers on the day of the 9/11 attacks, under the words, “‘Never forget,’ you said …” Under that is an image of Omar in her hijab, next to the words: “I am the proof — you have forgotten.”Omar, of course, had nothing to do with the attacks, but this crass display certainly tried to create a fake connection. It’s unclear who brought in the poster, but it was set up at a GOP event. Yet when Democrats in the state’s House of Delegates condemned the poster and its sentiments, Republicans delayed and changed the subject.When Omar made allegedly anti-Semitic remarks recently, there were no delays by congressional Democrats condemning her. Why is it taking Republicans so long to respond when examples like this underscore religious bigotry in their ranks?‘Back to Kenya’Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., reacted with horror and was nearly moved to tears during a high-profile hearing last week when Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., implied that a tactic he used was racist. Meadows brought Lynne Patton, an African-American regional director for the Department of Housing and Urban Development, to challenge allegations by President Donald Trump’s former lawyer that Trump was a racist. Patton was appointed by Trump.Tlaib said the use of a black employee at the hearing was a racist act of tokenism. Meadows reacted emotionally to the comment, after which Tlaib clarified she was not calling him a racist. They later hugged it out.But what explains the videos of Meadows, taken while he was campaigning in 2012, in which he made repeated racist tropes about sending President Barack Obama back to Kenya? Obama was born in America."
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Senate leader raises red flag over new plan to fix roads and bridges in Missouri,"Mar 7, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/senate-leader-raises-red-flag-over-new-plan-to-fix/article_5d5fc1b2-5661-50f8-b81d-0656d7b020e6.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • A new blueprint to fix roads and bridges faces a potentially bumpy ride in the Missouri Senate.A day after House leaders abandoned Gov. Mike Parson’s plan to borrow $350 million to fix 250 bridges, Senate President Pro Tem Dave Schatz, R-Sullivan, suggested the alternative financing proposal floated in the House could put millions of dollars in federal funds at risk.“I don’t want to lose the opportunity to draw down federal money,” Schatz said Thursday.

Among the projects that could be scuttled if the state loses federal dollars are long awaited upgrades to the Interstate 70 bridge over the Missouri River in Rocheport, west of Columbia, Schatz said.His comments show that the road to funding upgrades and maintenance for Missouri’s transportation infrastructure remains filled with political potholes as the Legislature rumbles to the midpoint in its annual session.On Wednesday, House Budget Chairman Cody Smith, R-Carthage, said instead of borrowing money to fund bridge repairs, he is recommending the state use $100 million in general revenue to pay for the fixes.The concept won support from some members of the Senate, who already were poised to suggest alternatives to Parson’s borrowing proposal.“It’s definitely a plan I think I could get behind,” said Sen. Denny Hoskins, R-Warrensburg.“We already have a record amount of revenue coming into the state. With all that money coming in the door, why not take a portion of that and direct it into the highway fund,” said Sen. Bill Eigel, R-Weldon Spring.The state’s general fund revenues for the fiscal year ending in June were up over the previous year, but receipts for this fiscal year are running about $300 million behind expectations. Officials say they believe that amount could be made up as people pay their 2018 tax bills.
Parson’s plan would allow for the sale of bonds to pay for four years of projects at a cost of about $29.9 million annually for 15 years. The bonds would have an interest rate of 3.25 percent, meaning taxpayers would be on the hook for $100 million in interest payments.The governor’s proposal came after he had campaigned hard to persuade voters in November to approve a phased-in 10-cent increase in the gasoline tax.
After voters rejected the tax hike, Parson said his bonding plan could serve as a stopgap until support could be found for a long-range transportation funding program.In a statement Wednesday, Parson’s office expressed confidence that a final agreement could be reached before lawmakers adjourn in May.Eigel also acknowledged the House plan would not address the state’s long-term infrastructure needs.“This is a short-term solution to how we’re going to address some of the most pressing needs in our infrastructure,” Eigel said.Schatz, who also supported the gasoline tax increase, said he could not commit to the House plan. But, like Parson, he said he is pleased there are talks underway.“There’s opportunities for discussion,” Schatz said. “I think all options are on the table.”Other road funding proposals being discussed under the Capitol dome include raising vehicle fees and an alternative registration system based on mileage instead of horsepower.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Vouchers, charter school expansion are getting push from Republicans in Missouri","Mar 7, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/vouchers-charter-school-expansion-are-getting-push-from-republicans-in/article_fc36e9ee-64a8-5136-bff1-815bd4eb63e0.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • A heated debate is brewing in the Missouri House and Senate over a series of proposals that would alter the landscape of public education in Missouri.In the House, legislators had been poised to consider a plan Wednesday that would allow charter schools beyond the boundaries of St. Louis and Kansas City — a controversial initiative that was destined to cause fissures within both the GOP caucus and the Legislative Black Caucus.With a showdown looming, legislative leaders instead delayed debate on the matter, giving them at least another week to try and secure the needed number of votes.

""There's been some fierce a-- conversations,"" said freshman state Rep. Wiley Price, D-St. Louis, who said Wednesday morning that he had not decided which way to vote.GOP leadership, from the governor's office to the House speaker's office, was actively engaged in trying to push the measure through the lower chamber.""If I knew, I couldn't tell you,"" said Rep. Shamed Dogan, R-Ballwin, when asked what kind of pressure was being exerted by leadership on rank-and-file legislators. ""There's a lot of negotiations going on.""Rep. Elaine Gannon, a De Soto Republican and former educator, was tight-lipped about her opposition to the measure.""I'm against it, but no comment,"" she said shortly before the House came to order at 10 a.m. Wednesday.Rep. Rebecca Roeber, R-Lee's Summit, is sponsoring the plan leadership was pushing. The package would allow charter schools to open in St. Louis County and in cities across the state with populations greater than 30,000.Charter schools are currently allowed only in St. Louis and Kansas City. Under the proposal, St. Louis County, St. Charles County, Jefferson County and cities like Columbia, Jefferson City, Springfield and Joplin could see charter schools if the legislation were signed into law.Charter schools are designed to be innovative alternatives to the school districts in which they operate, but opponents say they reduce funds that would otherwise go to public schools.The push for votes in the House also came as the Senate was poised to debate education-related legislation that school advocacy groups are scrambling to stop.The proposal sponsored by Sen. Andrew Koenig, R-Manchester, would create  a new 100 percent state tax credit capped at $25 million per year for taxpayer contributions to third-party organizations.A debate on the plan was expected to begin Wednesday, but it, too, was postponed while leaders determine if the measure can win enough support to advance.Koenig’s proposal would establish the Missouri Empowerment Scholarship Accounts Program. In addition to allowing parents to use the money to finance their child’s elementary and secondary education at a school of their choice, it would change the way students can transfer from low-performing districts and schools.The measure would affect school districts throughout the St. Louis region, including the 23,000-student city district, the Ferguson-Florissant district, as well as Normandy, Parkway, Wentzville and the Francis Howell district in St. Charles County.
The renewed debate on charter schools is partly the result of Gov. Mike Parson’s bid to create a $22 million scholarship program for adults seeking to learn new skills for high demand jobs.Debate on the governor’s so-called “Fast Track” program ground to halt last month as Republican members sought to attach amendments to it that could allow for the expansion of charter schools and educational savings accounts that could help parents pay for private schools.Senate Majority Leader Caleb Rowden, R-Columbia, told reporters last week the two issues have become tied together as the Legislature moves forward.“I don’t think it’s any secret that there are some folks who would like to see us have a conversation on education reform kind of as a part of that discussion,” Rowden said. “I would say there is a good possibility that we’ll see the charter bill or the ESA bill on the floor next week.”
Advocacy groups on both sides of the issue have dug in and are lobbying lawmakers.The American Federation for Children, for example, is among the out-of-state special interest groups pushing for the change.The California-based organization, which supports charter school expansion efforts, formerly was headed by U.S. Department of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, a longtime advocate for charter schools.The group has contributed more than $175,000 to Republican interests in the past two years.On March 1, the American Federation for Children hired Scott Jensen, the former speaker of the Wisconsin House of Representatives, to lobby in Missouri.Jensen, a charter school advocate, was convicted of three misconduct in office felonies in 2006 and sentenced to 15 months in prison. In 2010, he reached an agreement to have the charges dismissed.School groups opposed to the changes also reported a heightened level of engagement.Brent Ghan, deputy executive director for the Missouri School Boards’ Association, said local school district officials have been flooding lawmaker offices with their concerns.“Our members are extremely engaged in this issue and have been contacting their local legislators about it in significant numbers. They are concerned about both of these issues,” Ghan said. “We’ve seen a higher level of engagement from our members on both of these issues than we’ve seen in a long time.”Doug Hayter, executive director of the Missouri Association of School Administrators, said scheduling both bills to be debated in separate chambers on the same day may indicate that Republican leaders wanted to dilute the power of the opponents.“It certainly makes you wonder,” Hayter said. “For us, it’s pretty much all hands on deck. We’re definitely putting out alerts to all of our education advocates.”

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Editorial: Missouri could soon shut down its system of de facto debtors' prisons.,"Mar 6, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-missouri-could-soon-shut-down-its-system-of-de/article_a8ab7bc9-99f1-54a4-bea6-8cee85a46bf4.html,"The Missouri House this week gave near-unanimous approval to a measure that would stop local court systems from trapping those who commit minor crimes in an endless cycle of escalating fines and incarceration. The Senate should waste no time passing this bill so Gov. Mike Parson, a supporter of criminal justice reform, can sign it.This system of de facto debtors prisons only came to lawmakers’ attention because of an ongoing series of columns by the Post-Dispatch’s Tony Messenger. His reporting serves as a reminder of the importance of a free and vibrant press.Messenger spotlighted a phantom industry of local courts squeezing low-income defendants for more and more money once they’ve been jailed for even minor infractions. Under state law, defendants can be billed for the expense of jailing them. Those who can’t afford these bills can end up back in jail for non-payment — which adds additional debt to their room-and-board bill.

In this way, defendants who have been arrested for traffic offenses or other misdemeanor infractions that might normally cost a few hundred dollars in fines and a few days in jail can instead rack up thousands of dollars in jail fees. An inability to pay prompts more and more jail time. It’s a self-perpetuating scam. The longer the defendant is jailed, the more fees are charged, making it harder to pay, which is used as justification for still more jail time and bills.For many defendants, there’s no way to break this cycle. But the Legislature can, and it looks like it soon will.
As the Post-Dispatch’s Jack Suntrup reported this week, the pending measure would forbid courts in the state from jailing defendants for failure to pay previous jail fees. Counties could still use civil action to collect those fees, but they could no longer treat poor defendants like monetary investments that grow each time they’re slapped back in jail.
The measure, House Bill 192, passed the House Monday on a 156-1 vote. That’s an unusual level of agreement on any substantive issue these days, but in this case, the legislation makes so much sense that the only surprise is that there was even one vote against it.All indications are it will get through the Senate with similar ease. It seems a good bet that the governor would sign it, given that he has strongly and correctly made the case for criminal justice reform in general. This is the very definition of such reform.Missouri should close this dark chapter in its jurisprudence, but it’s important for all to remember how this distorted system was exposed. It wasn’t reformers in the court system or Legislature who initially flushed out this injustice; it was the free press — an institution politically and economically beset from all sides today, but one without which democracy cannot survive."
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Bridge to nowhere? Missouri House budget chief rebuffs governor's infrastructure plan,"Mar 6, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/business/local/bridge-to-nowhere-missouri-house-budget-chief-rebuffs-governor-s/article_b545c617-0500-5d22-bd30-30e8715c6008.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • The chairman of the Missouri House Budget Committee broke Wednesday with Gov. Mike Parson’s administration by saying he would not support the governor’s plan to bond millions of dollars for bridge improvements.House Budget Chairman Cody Smith, R-Carthage, said that instead of borrowing $350 million to fund repairs for more than 200 bridges across the state, he would recommend the state put $100 million toward road and bridge repairs next fiscal year.“Our state transportation department already has a heavy debt load and has paid more than $700 million in debt payments in just the last two years. The solution to fix our roads isn’t to go further into debt, but instead to invest wisely and responsibly in our transportation network with the funds we have available,” Smith said in a statement.

Parson’s plan would allow for the sale of bonds to pay for four years of projects at a cost of about $29.9 million annually for 15 years. The bonds would have an interest rate of 3.25 percent, meaning taxpayers would be on the hook for $100 million in interest payments.Smith said he wanted the state to put $100 million in general revenue toward infrastructure projects for the next four years. He said that using general revenue instead of issuing bonds would help the state avoid additional debt service.
“During the State of the State, the Governor shared his vision and top budget priorities that focus on workforce development and infrastructure,” Parson’s spokesman, Steele Shippy, said in a statement. “The House budget proposal maintains a number of the Governor’s priorities, which is very promising, but they have also proposed a different route to our shared priority of infrastructure,” he said.
“With plenty of time left in this year’s session, we are confident a final agreement is possible.” “The Governor will continue discussions with both the House and Senate to reach an end result that moves Missouri forward.”Smith’s move came as the House Budget Committee was considering on Wednesday the latest draft of the state’s $30 billion spending plan for fiscal year 2020, which begins on July 1.The budget panel will vote next week on amendments to the revised plan before budget legislation moves to the full House for consideration at the end of the month, Smith said.When the House approves the spending blueprint, it will move to the Senate for consideration.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Editorial: Protecting juvenile offenders' right to legal representation,"Mar 5, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-protecting-juvenile-offenders-right-to-legal-representation/article_d1722ccb-4e7f-5b43-9db7-23caeb04bcba.html,"An all too common tragedy occurs in juvenile justice when young people accused of crimes are pressured into signing away their right to an attorney or making statements without an attorney present. They can wind up effectively criminalizing themselves in situations where an even mildly competent attorney would otherwise intervene to protect them.The juveniles who exercise bad judgment and wind up in police custody aren’t usually the ones prone to make the best judgments when it comes to waiving their rights during police interrogations. A simple misstatement can launch a redeemable kid into the pipeline of adult imprisonment.Too much is at stake for juveniles to lack an extra layer of protection before giving up their rights. A bill by Missouri state Rep. Ingrid Burnett, D-Kansas City, seeks to remedy that by limiting the circumstances under which juveniles can waive their right to an attorney.

“Most people don’t realize that this is happening to our juveniles,” Burnett told the House Children and Families Committee. House Bill 42 would not allow a juvenile offender to waive his or her right to counsel unless it happens in open court with a judge’s approval.The Legislature’s GOP majority should have no qualms about supporting this bill because it’s about protecting constitutional rights and minimizing the burdens placed on government by an overpopulated, underfunded juvenile justice system. The goal must never be to imprison as many juveniles as possible; it should be to find the quickest and most efficient route to rehabilitation and reintroduction of offenders to law-abiding society.
According to the Post-Dispatch’s Jack Suntrup, a 2013 report by the National Juvenile Defender Center found only a few Missouri counties willing to “rigorously defend the right to counsel for juveniles.” In most counties, “youth are discouraged from and systematically denied counsel.”
Who wins under such scenarios? The state winds up incarcerating kids and launching them on a path toward more criminality as adults. Taxpayers wind up shouldering the burden of their imprisonment when far less expensive and more effective means of rehabilitation are available.Burnett’s bill would require court certification that a juvenile has “knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily” waived the right to legal counsel. A judge would presumably question the child to make sure he or she fully understands the implications. The bill would require a judge’s order before rights could be waived.This would be a major change from current procedures in which police interrogators behind closed doors can coerce or trick juveniles into waiving the right to counsel, after which they are at the mercy of their far-more-savvy adult handlers.Gov. Mike Parson can do his part to help the cause of juvenile justice by addressing the nearly $30 million funding gap that is preventing young offenders from receiving the help they need from public defenders."
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri moves to close Pine Lawn day care where worker was filmed tossing a 3-year-old girl,"Mar 4, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-moves-to-close-pine-lawn-day-care-where-worker/article_6e9b8dd9-cf2f-51e2-a30f-ab25df10e85a.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Gov. Mike Parson’s administration is moving to shut down a north St. Louis County day care after a worker there was filmed last month tossing a 3-year-old girl across a room.The Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services on Friday sent a letter to Sharon Phillips Williams, the registered agent of Brighter Day Care and Preschool in Pine Lawn, telling her the state was revoking the facility’s license.Emergency crews on Feb. 1 took a 3-year-old girl, with a deep gash in her head, to a hospital, where she received stitches. As police were investigating, they also discovered a second victim, whom another worker allegedly threw on a cot. Two day care workers now face abuse charges stemming from the incidents.

“These actions do not demonstrate that Brighter Day Care & Preschool, Inc. is able to provide a safe environment for children,” Sue Porting, administrator of the Department of Health and Senior Services’ child care section, said in the 17-page letter mailed on Friday.

The day care has a month to appeal the decision to the state Administrative Hearing Commission and will be allowed to remain open during the appeals process. The state and the day care could enter into a settlement agreement as the two sides await a hearing.A woman who answered the phone at the day care on Monday hung up when asked whether anyone was available to comment.The letter says state inspectors substantiated two other complaints at the same day care last year.The DHSS wrote to the day care on July 20 that it substantiated a complaint that a 3-year-old boy was “slammed” on a cot by a worker on May 29. The child complained of neck pain and side pain, and had scratches on his neck.In August, the state substantiated a complaint that in July, a day care van driver dropped a 6-year-old child off at the wrong house and that the driver left without ensuring the child was with the proper caretaker, according to the letter.Dr. Randall Williams, director of DHSS, said at a news conference Monday that the department had received complaints about Brighter Day Care prior to 2018.“In this particular facility’s case, those were investigated and not felt to be a systemic process problem, but more of an individual problem,” Williams said of complaints made prior to this year. “However, more recently, it was determined that this was a facility problem.”
Parson, a Republican, announced the move at the same news conference that he was launching a child care working group that would examine industry issues. Various stakeholders will report back to the governor by June 1, he said.“Missouri parents who place their child into the hands of a child care provider expect their child will get quality, safe care while they work hard to support their family,” Parson said in a statement. “I am committed to doing everything I can to protect our children. As a father, grandfather, and Governor, this must be a priority for us all.”The incident at the Brighter Day Care and Preschool in Pine Lawn was the latest of a string of incidents at St. Louis-area day cares.In November, KTVI (Channel 2) published video footage from 2016 of 3- and 4-year-olds engaging in fist fights at the Adventure Learning Center in St. Louis. Attorney General Eric Schmitt is investigating what his office called a “day care fight club.”
In December, police found a dead infant at an unlicensed day care in Maplewood. Legislation by state Sen. Jill Schupp, D-Creve Coeur, seeks to further crack down on unlicensed child care facilities, which have caused problems in Missouri for years. The measure would add accountability measures and closes a loophole in state regulations that allows a caretaker to oversee an unlimited number of related children.“When you open your home for business, the business of caring for children, there is no room for over-extension,” Schupp said during a Senate committee hearing on Monday. “Not being able to adequately serve your customers is not like selling an under-cooked burger or measuring the length of plywood incorrectly. Not serving your customers when you open your home to childcare can and does result in neglect, injury and horribly, even death.”The Post-Dispatch reported in June that St. Louis-area providers are grappling with a shortage of preschool teachers, who in private and nonprofit settings make an average of $12 an hour. A national survey found preschool teachers can make closer to $20 an hour working for public school districts.St. Louis-area families also were struggling to find quality care for children. Wait lists at centers with good reputations can reach six to 18 months before a spot opens, the Post-Dispatch report said.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Josh Hawley served with subpoena after delivering CPAC speech, Democrat says","Mar 1, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/josh-hawley-served-with-subpoena-after-delivering-cpac-speech-democrat/article_5e6c8dd9-c909-51d2-9bf1-94cafdeb5368.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • A Democrat running for Missouri attorney general says his process server personally served Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., on Friday with a subpoena during the Conservative Political Action Conference.The Cole County Circuit Court issued a subpoena last month at Elad Gross’ request. Though one was delivered to Hawley’s Senate office, a subpoena had not been delivered to Hawley personally.Hawley’s attorneys listed the failure to serve Hawley personally as one reason a Cole County judge should quash the subpoena. Gross told the Post-Dispatch that Hawley was handed a subpoena by a process server after Hawley delivered a speech at CPAC in Washington on Friday.

“We got him,” Gross said on Twitter. “After more than two weeks of evading service, Senator Josh Hawley was personally served with the subpoena at CPAC.”“This is another political stunt by a political candidate,” Hawley spokeswoman Kelli Ford said in an email. “The reality is that Mr. Gross has been evading a court date to discuss the matter.”
Court records show that a hearing in the case was scheduled for Friday but was recently rescheduled for March 15. Gross denied he was evading a hearing.
The subpoena stems from an open records dispute Gross has with the state. He is seeking a cache of documents from Gov. Mike Parson’s office related to then-Gov. Eric Greitens, but the governor’s office won’t turn the documents over unless Gross signs a $3,600 check.Gross filed a complaint with Hawley’s attorney general’s office last fall, but the attorney general’s office sided with Parson’s administration.Gross wants Hawley to bring to his deposition “any and all communications, recordings, calendars, notes, and/or other documents involving you, campaign donors, state employees, consultants, and/or others” that relate to the application of the Sunshine Law in regard to Gross’ request.Ford has also said that Hawley personally isn’t a party to Gross’ lawsuit.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Day care worker accused of child abuse after video shows her throwing a toddler in a classroom, authorities say","Feb 28, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/national/day-care-worker-accused-of-child-abuse-after-video-shows/article_0a20a82a-a92f-53dc-a74e-51ab138b2214.html,"A day care worker in Missouri was charged Thursday with child abuse after she was captured on a surveillance video throwing a 3-year-old girl into furniture last month, police said.The North County Police Cooperative identified the former employee as Wilma Brown, 27. A felony warrant has been issued for Brown's arrest after the incident on February 1 at Brighter Day Care and Preschool in Pine Lawn, outside St. Louis, police said.Brown, who in the day care's surveillance video appears to grab the child, wrote that the child suffered a ""bump on her head"" after falling on the carpet, according to a copy of the unintentional injury form provided by the family's attorney, Jennifer Hansen.

The toddler was treated at a hospital for a gash in the middle of her forehead and swelling in her face. She received seven stitches, then was readmitted two days later after the wound became infected, Hansen said. The toddler's family grew concerned that a fall had caused their daughter so much anguish and asked to see the day care's surveillance footage.On February 5, the family watched the footage with the day care's director, Hansen said. Brown was subsequently fired, according to Hansen and Timothy J. Smith, an attorney representing the day care.Brown could not be reached Thursday for comment. Smith did not say when she was terminated.North County Police Cooperative could not be reached Thursday.Surveillance video shows girl hurled into a cabinetThe video shows the 3-year-old standing still at a desk before the employee approaches. The woman grabs the child by the arm, pulls her for several feet then appears to hurl her into a cabinet. A thud can be heard on the surveillance footage.A family member recorded the surveillance footage on a cell phone and the family's attorney gave that video to CNN.""Brighter Day Care and Preschool, Inc. will continue to follow guidelines and regulations to ensure the safety of the children,"" Smith said in a statement.Lawyer: Day care called it a fall but it was an assaultHansen said the 3-year-old's family ""hopes that the release of the surveillance footage will result in justice for this child and ensure that other children are not harmed by the very people entrusted to keep them safe.""
""In no world did this family have any idea that what was called a fall was actually an assault until they came to see that video,"" Hansen told CNN affiliate KTVI.Hansen told the station: ""The day care could've reviewed that footage at any time.""""They didn't, and they allowed the day care worker who assaulted this little girl to continue to work at the facility for five additional days,"" Hansen said.
The child's parents have requested that their names not be disclosed, but Hansen told CNN in an interview on Thursday they are willing to cooperate with any investigation into the incident.Mom wonders what she could have done differentlyHansen said the 3-year-old's mother ""feels terrible that this happened to her family.""She is ""strong for her daughter, but privately she is wondering what she could have done differently,"" Hansen said.Smith, the day care's attorney, said the day care's teachers and staff ""are properly trained and extremely qualified.""""Providing a quality education in a safe environment is of the utmost importance to our teachers and staff,"" he said in the statement.Missouri Gov. Mike Parson said in a statement: ""After seeing this horrific video and videos from multiple cases in recent weeks, I am committed to doing everything I can to protect our children and grandchildren.""Hansen said the child is home from the hospital and her family is consulting with a plastic surgeon in the hopes of reducing the visibility of the scar on the child's forehead.""This sweet little girl is getting lots of love and support from her family while she heals from her injuries,"" Hansen said in the statement."
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"With Missourians facing smaller refunds, state tax chief admits changes were his idea","Feb 28, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/with-missourians-facing-smaller-refunds-state-tax-chief-admits-changes/article_4a0cef65-0e2e-590c-a52f-182e28509cd0.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • For months, the director of Missouri’s tax collection agency claimed he discovered and corrected a 15-year-old error in the state’s tax tables that has resulted in people getting smaller refunds on their 2018 income tax returns.On Wednesday, he painted a different picture of the events that have led to vexing reductions in 2018 income tax returns for millions of Missourians.In front of a House committee investigating the Missouri Department of Revenue, Director Joel Walters said he himself ordered the change to reduce the amount of money withheld from a worker’s check in response to changes that were put in place after federal tax cuts went into effect last year.

“It felt like in my judgment making that formulaic change made this more accurate,” Walters said. “I was trying to do the right thing, and I was trying to make the calculation more accurate.”The revelation came a week after Gov. Mike Parson scolded members of the House for probing the tax changes, calling their grilling of Walters on two previous occasions “political grandstanding.”Members of the House Special Committee on Government Oversight, still rankled by Parson’s defense of Walters, said their suspicions had been correct.“It certainly appears to me that the story has been changing,” said Rep. Dirk Deaton, R-Noel. “That is problematic.”For many taxpayers, the tinkering by Walters, combined with the federal tax changes, will mean a lower tax refund or a higher tax bill on their 2018 taxes. The tables, he said, failed to account for the standard deduction, which is the amount of income taxpayers can subtract in calculating their federal taxes.For a married couple making a total of $100,000 and each claiming one dependent, the department says their 2018 refund would be $67, down from $516 for 2017.
A single filer with no dependents making $36,000 annually would face a tax bill of $58 for 2018, rather than a refund of $53 as in 2017.With about four weeks of tax filings on the books, the average refund is down $78 and the average tax due is up $65, said Walters, who was hired by then- Gov. Eric Greitens in 2017 after 35 years in the private sector.The state also is lagging behind in tax revenues as taxpayers delay paying their bills.
The department has since issued new withholding tables that went into effect on Jan. 1, so the issue should not play a role in 2019.Walters also told the committee that his department had asked tax preparation software companies such as TurboTax to not charge penalties to affected Missourians.“We’re not going to be enforcing penalties,” Walters said.In addition to trying to spread the message on the agency’s social media accounts, Walters also said the department had mailed 25,000 notices about the changes to businesses and planned to send 200,000 more.Despite the prodding of lawmakers, Walters did not say he regretted the department’s actions.“If it was misleading to use the word ‘error,’ then I shouldn’t have,” Walters said. “I don’t know if I regret it. I still think I did the right thing.”

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri House gives green light to governor's 'Fast Track' jobs program,"Feb 28, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-house-gives-green-light-to-governor-s-fast-track/article_34390664-58a8-5d53-ae83-08fae25db617.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • The Missouri House handed Gov. Mike Parson a victory Thursday, approving a mostly intact version of his proposed scholarship program for adults seeking jobs in high-demand trades.Although funding issues remain a potential roadblock to the so-called “Fast Track” program, the measure was approved on a bipartisan 101-49 vote.Parson, who took over in June, has made workforce development a key plank in his first legislative session. The program is included in the $30 billion budget proposal he unveiled Jan. 16.

The Republican chief executive says the top priority for most businesses in picking a location is the quality of the workforce. Parson believes companies may be bypassing Missouri because of a shortage of trained workers.The program would offer tuition assistance to people age 25 and older who want to return to school for training in hard-to-fill jobs.Students must earn an adjusted annual gross income of less than $40,000 if they are single, or $80,000 per year if filing jointly. Anyone who has already earned a bachelor’s degree would be ineligible.The Department of Higher Education would create an annual list of positions where there is a need for workers.“It captures the folks that are falling through the cracks,” said Rep. Doug Beck, D-Affton.The Missouri Chamber of Commerce hailed the House action.“With today’s tight labor markets, we can’t afford to squander a single worker. We need every worker to maximize their potential,” said Daniel P. Mehan, president and CEO of the Missouri Chamber.
Not everyone supports the plan.Rep. Justin Hill, R-Lake Saint Louis, said the state should not be providing free tuition.
“This is a significant step to free education for all,” Hill said.Other Republicans voting “no” included Reps. John Wiemann of O’Fallon, Ron Hicks of Dardenne Prairie, Bruce DeGroot of Chesterfield and Shamed Dogan of Ballwin.Parson had sought $22 million for the program, saying it would serve 16,000 individuals.A House appropriations subcommittee recommended diverting more than $4 million from the program to fund other education priorities.The measure also has faced opposition in the Senate. Some senators want to cap the tuition level. Others want to require students to stay in Missouri for a set period of time if they take the money.Before voting to send the measure to the Senate Thursday, the House added a provision requiring the Legislature to revisit the law in three years to determine if it is working as intended.The legislation is House Bill 225.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri abortion ban heading for showdown in Senate,"Feb 27, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-abortion-ban-heading-for-showdown-in-senate/article_c34ca610-dfa6-54cb-98a0-e1d18175cfb5.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Moving at a rapid-fire pace, the Missouri House forwarded legislation to the Senate Wednesday that would ban almost all abortions in the state if the U.S. Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade.Just a day after giving initial approval to the sweeping measure, the Republican-led chamber voted 117-39 in favor of a legislative package that includes a provision to ban a woman from aborting a fetus that might have Down syndrome, as well as one requiring that both parents be notified before a minor receives an abortion.It contains no exceptions for pregnancies that are the result of rape or incest.

“I am proud. We just put together the strongest pro-life bill in this country,” said Rep. Sonya Anderson, R-Springfield. “We are doing a good thing today. We are standing up for our children and we are standing up for our mothers.”“Today, we can stand for the unborn by supporting this bill,” said Rep. Nick Schroer, R-O’Fallon, who sponsored the measure.Schroer’s proposal started out as a ban on most abortions once a fetal heartbeat can be detected. But, as part of national effort by anti-abortion forces, the bill was quickly loaded with amendments that would toughen the state’s already restrictive abortion laws in other ways.Since peaking at more than 20,000 per year in the 1980s, the number of abortions in Missouri has dropped to 6,790 in 2017. The only abortion provider in the state is in St. Louis.Abortion opponents want the newly revamped U.S. Supreme Court to reverse Roe v. Wade, or uphold specific state laws that could undermine the court’s 1973 ruling establishing a nationwide right to abortion.Gov. Mike Parson has indicated he supports the measure.First, however, the bill heads to the Senate, where Republicans hold a 24-10 advantage over Democrats.Sen. Jamilah Nasheed, D-St. Louis, said she would do “everything possible” to kill the bill.“They’re gonna have a hell of a fight on their hands because we are sick and tired of the Republican Party — especially male-dominated House and Senate — dictating to women their reproductive health, and their reproductive rights. This is the hill to die on,” Nasheed said.In the House, Rep. Ian Mackey, D-St. Louis, decried the proposed law, saying Republicans shouldn’t be competing with other states to be the test case for the high court.
“I view women as more than just the candy wrapper for the fetus they are carrying. I trust women to make their own health care decisions,” Mackey said.Rep. Cora Faith Walker, D-Ferguson, called the proposal “draconian” and said it would hurt women and children, especially minority women and children.“I am terrified of this bill,” Walker said.
Rep. LaDonna Appelbaum, D-St. Louis County , also opposed the measure.“I trust Missouri women, and I am disappointed that this chamber prides itself in passing the most restrictive abortion laws in this country,” Appelbaum said. “There is no way to eliminate abortions. There is only a way to eliminate safe abortions.”But Rep. Steve Butz, D-St. Louis, an abortion opponent, said the law wouldn’t eliminate abortion because women could cross the border into Illinois to obtain one.“We have really not stopped abortion. Abortion will continue, and they always have,” Butz said.The legislation is House Bill 126.Jack Suntrup of the Post-Dispatch contributed to this report.People have been protesting on both sides of the abortion issue for decades

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Most abortions would be banned in Missouri under proposed new law,"Feb 27, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/most-abortions-would-be-banned-in-missouri-under-proposed-new/article_222c534c-1901-5aca-87c9-0b5a79f98673.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Most abortions would be banned in Missouri under a sweeping new proposal given initial approval Tuesday by lawmakers in the House.Although Missouri already is one of the more restrictive states when it comes to access to abortion, the latest move by the Republican-controlled Legislature comes amid a nationwide effort by abortion foes to get anti-abortion laws on the books that could be upheld by the newly revamped U.S. Supreme Court.“Today, let us make known to citizens of this great state and every state in the nation that Missouri stands for the unborn,” said Rep. Nick Schroer, who is sponsoring the legislation.

The St. Charles County Republican’s bill initially was written to ban abortions if a fetal heartbeat can be detected.But, the measure soon became a vehicle for a number of other amendments, including a provision that would make abortion illegal in Missouri if the U.S. Supreme Court strikes down the landmark Roe v. Wade law that legalized abortion.Rep. Holly Rehder, R-Sikeston, said lawmakers should act quickly to install a so-called “trigger law” because some states are moving in the opposite direction of Missouri by approving less restrictive abortion laws.“We’ve got to get serious in Missouri. And we’ve got to pass these laws to prevent that from ever occurring here,” Rehder said.Over the objections of Democrats, the GOP-dominant chamber also added an amendment requiring both parents be notified if a minor seeks an abortion. And, they tacked on a provision barring abortions from being performed solely because the baby has Down syndrome.Opponents said abortion laws should be left alone in order to allow women to decide what’s best for their lives.“I don’t know the circumstances of other people’s lives. I would never ever purport to know what’s best for their lives,” said Rep. Keri Ingle, D-Lee’s Summit.“I think it will hurt a lot of people,” added Rep. Judy Morgan, D-Kansas City.The measure would require providers to check for a fetal heartbeat before performing abortions or pay a $1,000 fine and face a potential loss or revocation of a physicians’ medical license.An Iowa judge last month struck down that state’s fetal heartbeat law, citing a number of earlier decisions that found such laws were unconstitutional. That could lead to a hearing in front of the high court, which has two new conservative members — Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh.The measure advanced to final passage stage next week on a 110-37 vote. No Republicans opposed the measure. Three Democrats voted “yes.”
Action on the legislation came less than a week after a federal judge ruled that a separate set of Missouri restrictions were not “undue” burdens on women seeking abortions.Under current state law, clinics that provide abortions must have physicians with admitting privileges at a nearby hospital. The Planned Parenthood clinic in Columbia has been unable to secure a physician with those privileges after a panel of medical staff at University of Missouri Health Care decided to stop offering the privileges in 2015.St. Louis has the only clinic able to offer abortions in the state. In 2017, there were 6,790 abortions performed in the state, which Gov. Mike Parson in a statement praising the House action said was a record low.“Thanks to decades of conservative, pro-life leadership, Missouri recently hit an all-time low for the number of abortions,” Parson said. “It’s also encouraging to see the ‘dramatic shift’ in how people identify regarding pro-life issues as the country is engaged in a national conversation about the future of abortion policies. I look forward to the General Assembly’s continued debate on these important pro-life issues.”
U.S. Western District Court Judge Brian Wimes ruled Friday that the admitting privileges did not affect enough women to constitute an undue burden.The ruling, too, was lauded Parson, who supported the legislation that led to the ruling when he was a lawmaker.“This is a huge victory for protecting women’s health and the right to life,” Parson said. “It’s sad that Planned Parenthood continues to fight against ensuring that a woman’s abortion provider has privileges to a nearby hospital when complications arise.”A Parson spokesman said the governor is monitoring the status of abortion-related legislation in the House and the Senate.“We’ll continue to work closely with the Legislature,” the spokesman said.On Wednesday, a Senate committee is scheduled to hear three additional changes to Missouri abortion law, including one that would make the performance of an abortion a criminal offense, except in a medical emergency.The legislation is House Bill 126.People have protested both sides of the abortion issue for decades

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Missouri children are waiving their right to legal counsel. That's a problem, some lawmakers say.","Feb 27, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/missouri-children-are-waiving-their-right-to-legal-counsel-that/article_07be6481-2171-5795-b3a8-4095e18e54f0.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Courts across Missouri are pushing juvenile offenders to forgo legal representation, the Missouri public defender’s office and criminal justice reform advocates said Tuesday — a practice, they said, that denies children their constitutional right to representation and leads to worse outcomes for the state.“Most people don’t realize that this is happening to our juveniles,” state Rep. Ingrid Burnett, D-Kansas City, told the House Children and Families Committee. She has sponsored legislation that would make it more difficult for children to waive counsel.Advocates said that the state’s punishment should fit a juvenile’s crime — and that by forgoing legal representation, which can extend the legal process, too many juveniles are unnecessarily being incarcerated rather than entering community-based services.

A 2013 report by the National Juvenile Defender Center said that in Missouri, “with the exception of a few counties that rigorously defend the right to counsel for juveniles, youth are discouraged from and systematically denied counsel throughout the state.”The U.S. Department of Justice said in 2015 that “little has changed” in St. Louis County since the 2013 report, and the federal government entered into a four-year agreement with St. Louis County to address rights violations and racial disparities.A 2018 report from the Justice Department said St. Louis County was in full compliance with nearly all of the federal government's recommendations.Under Burnett’s House Bill 42, if a child waives his or her right to counsel, such a decision would be made in open court and recorded in writing.“We don’t know how many of those children waived because juvenile proceedings are closed proceedings, and there’s no way to track what children are waiving counsel,” said Sarah Johnson, director of juvenile defense and policy for the public defender’s office.“Most recently I came across a 10-year-old child who was placed in the detention center after a couple of days,” she told the committee. “He was put in front of the court and the court asked his mother to interrogate him based on the charges. After that, the court then asked the mother and the child if they would like to have counsel. You know, they had already gone through the proceeding, they were already in court, and a 10-year-old child does not understand what counsel is. So they waive counsel.”Under the legislation, a juvenile would have to “knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily” waive their right to representation for the decision to be legitimate.If a child does waive his or her right, the waiver would apply to only that court proceeding, not the defendant’s entire case. And during certain proceedings, a juvenile would not be able to waive representation at all.“Children, and particularly children who get into trouble, don’t exercise good judgment,” said Burnett, who has worked as a school counselor. “And so, expecting them to exercise good judgment when it comes to waiving their rights I think is a stretch.”“People are terrified of the court process,” said Rep. Jim Neely, R-Cameron. “They’re uninformed, they’re scared, they’re worried, and that’s part of our job here, to make the situation better.”Michael Barrett, the director of Missouri’s public defender system, said there was a higher recidivism rate for those who enter the Department of Corrections than for offenders who are kept under the control of the Division of Youth Services. Lawyers help persuade judges to keep children in the juvenile system.
Children with representation are more likely to have their records sealed than children without representation, the public defender’s office said. The office said unsealed records could harm a juvenile’s job and education prospects into adulthood.Even if Burnett’s legislation is signed into law, the Missouri public defender is chronically underfunded. The office is currently without a juvenile unit in both St. Louis and Kansas City.Lawmakers voted last year to fund juvenile resources within the public defender’s office with a $450,000 appropriation, but Gov. Mike Parson vetoed the line item last summer.














        
            Missouri governor's 'Fast Track' scholarship program slowed by budget concerns, skeptics

Part of the reason for the turbulence is penny-pinching by legislative budget writers.





Barrett said it would cost about $1 million per year to fund the juvenile units in St. Louis and Kansas City.Parson has proposed keeping overall funding for the public defender constant next year, at about $50 million. But that, Barrett said, means the office would still be underfunded by about $30 million.The lack of adequate funding ultimately leads to more juveniles and adults being incarcerated rather than returning to their communities, Barrett said.At the same time, legislative leaders and Parson have championed criminal justice reform this year.The Legislature is considering proposals that would free some geriatric inmates, reform mandatory minimum sentencing and expunge certain marijuana-related offenses.The Department of Corrections also plans to close the Crossroads Correctional Center in western Missouri. After years of growth, the state’s prison population is falling, officials have said.The main reason, department spokeswoman Karen Pojmann said, is a change to the state’s criminal code in 2017 that is leading to more people receiving probation.“Criminal justice reform is an important conversation to have,” said Rep. Kip Kendrick of Columbia, the ranking Democrat on the House Budget Committee. “I think it’s a conversation that can’t be had without adequately funding the public defenders.”The legislation is House Bill 42.Editor's note: A previous version of this article did not clarify that St. Louis County had made progress since 2015 with federally-mandated juvenile justice reforms.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Senator should support governor's workforce development plans,"Feb 26, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/mailbag/senator-should-support-governor-s-workforce-development-plans/article_d534e5ce-ae8b-5805-9792-07c012f2194e.html,"It’s unfortunate that one of Gov. Mike Parson’s two initiatives of workforce development and infrastructure investment is running into financial roadblocks in the Legislature. It makes me wonder why state Sen. Andrew Koenig of Manchester, who belongs to the same party as the governor, continues to spend much of his time in Jefferson City trying to spend state dollars on charter schools and private school vouchers when he represents the award-winning school districts of Kirkwood, Parkway and Rockwood.

I think he could really make a difference for Missouri by partnering with the governor on his priorities of helping underskilled, post high school adults get trained for the many skilled jobs that need to be filled in our region, as well as infrastructure investment, which has a much better chance of moving our state forward.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Two Missouri lawmakers want new redistricting czar to take public's suggestions,"Feb 25, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/two-missouri-lawmakers-want-new-redistricting-czar-to-take-public/article_927b2d46-3c8b-56cd-b0ce-b543d03438f6.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Missourians would have the chance to weigh in on the state’s redistricting process under two lawmakers’ proposals.Voters approved Amendment 1, known as Clean Missouri, in November, which altered the state’s redistricting process.A nonpartisan state demographer will lead the redistricting effort for state legislative seats prior to the November 2022 elections. The end result could be more Democrats serving in the Republican-dominated Legislature.

Legislation by Sen. Dan Hegeman, R-Cosby, and Rep. Curtis Trent, R-Springfield, would require the demographer to create an online portal for public commentary. The provisions do not alter Clean Missouri itself. “I think this will give a little bit of clarity and transparency to the process,” Trent told the House General Laws Committee on Monday. “I think there’s a good chance there will be some confusion surrounding this process as there generally is with any redistricting cycle, but especially in the face of some fairly significant changes that went through in the last election cycle.”People submitting comments would be required to disclose whether anyone funded their submission, and who cut the check. No one testified for or against Trent's measure and no committee members asked him questions.A Senate committee approved Hegeman's proposal last week. It will need approval from the full Senate before moving to the House.Auditor Nicole Galloway, the only Democrat holding statewide office, is in charge of the demographer application process. She will submit the names of three candidates to the Senate majority and minority leaders.Galloway's spokeswoman, Steph Deidrick, said the auditor's office will have more information about the process in coming weeks.
Republican leaders, including Gov. Mike Parson and Senate Majority Floor Leader Caleb Rowden, R-Columbia, have previously spoken out against Clean Missouri, saying changes need to be made.When asked about altering the redistricting portion of the amendment in a Senate news conference, Rowden said he doesn’t think “anything is off the table.”
He said the change may have been ""well-intentioned,"" but that the auditor's office should operate in an apolitical fashion. He said the new nonpartisan demographer — and the political back-and-forth that could manifest in the hiring process — will transform the auditor's office into a more political position.The state's current system of once-every-decade redistricting involves bipartisan commissions of political appointees who carve up the state's legislative districts.While Trent's legislation doesn't seek to hamstring the new demographer, House Democrats criticisms Republicans attempts to alter voter-approved laws.Republicans have sought to weaken a separate part of Clean Missouri that subjects lawmakers to the Sunshine Law.“It’s offensive to logic and it's offensive to us as a body,"" Rep. Mark Ellebracht, D-Liberty, said of the Republican proposals. ""We hold these seats because of the will of the people that put us here.” The bills are House Bill 973 and Senate Bill 213.  Kurt Erickson of the Post-Dispatch contributed to this report.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Editorial: Making the case for grandmother Mary Pickard's clemency,"Feb 25, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-making-the-case-for-grandmother-mary-pickard-s-clemency/article_5d458c73-0351-5188-bf1a-8bb6d7b5f04d.html,"Mary Pickard, a 70-year-old grandmother, has served 19 years in prison for the 1999 murder of her husband, Michael W. Pickard, in Caruthersville, Mo. Michael Pickard died from a gunshot wound in the back. Danny Lee Jones, an acquaintance of Mary Pickard, pleaded guilty to first-degree murder and armed criminal action in her husband’s shooting death. Jones is serving a life sentence.Mary Pickard also pleaded guilty to a first-degree murder charge. She admits agreeing to a plot to harm her husband after suffering years of extreme abuse from him. Given the severe trauma she experienced during her marriage, her psychological condition and limited involvement in the crime, Gov. Mike Parson should grant Mary Pickard clemency.Dr. Dana McCoy, the clinical psychologist who evaluated Mary Pickard, submitted a detailed report to the court that attests to the role abuse and cognitive impairment played in this case. “The examiner is of the opinion that the circumstances of Mary’s life were such that she believed her life and that of her son, Nathan, to be in serious, imminent danger,” the report concluded.

In 1999, various close relatives stated they had been aware of Michael Pickard’s violent tendencies. Mary Pickard had even pressed charges against him for assault but later dropped them.Mary Pickard’s petition for clemency and McCoy’s report graphically describe the years of physical and emotional abuse and repeated sexual assaults.Pickard says her husband threatened to kill her if she ever left him. The beatings and sexual assaults got to the point where she tried to escape to their guest room at night. “She began using the bed itself as a barricade up against the door in order to keep him out for a few hours,” her petition says. She even used the closet as a bathroom during the night to avoid having to leave the sanctity of the guest bedroom. She suffered post-traumatic stress disorder and major depression, it adds. Her IQ score of 69 at the time ranked in the second percentile.
Her file is filled with letters of support from her family, friends and community members willing to help her. Her son describes her as “the most caring and kind mother.” He writes, “Please have mercy on her for the fact that she was in an abusive relationship.”“I don’t want her to die alone,” her granddaughter wrote.
Pickard is serving a life sentence without the possibility of parole at the Chillicothe Correctional Center. Her sentencing lacked consideration of factors currently described as battered-spouse syndrome.By contrast, Edwin Hipp, 85, shot his wife in the neck and abdomen in 2016, killing her in cold blood. He never called 911. Last week, he received five years’ probation.Pickard has paid the price for her involvement in her husband’s death. She poses no threat to society and deserves to spend her final years with her family."
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Missouri governor's 'Fast Track' scholarship program slowed by budget concerns, skeptics","Feb 24, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-governor-s-fast-track-scholarship-program-slowed-by-budget/article_bb020745-adea-5b14-ad8e-c54516fc5fe7.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Gov. Mike Parson’s plan to launch a $22 million scholarship program for 16,000 Missouri adults seeking jobs in high-demand trades was praised by lawmakers when he outlined the initiative in January.But now that the measure is beginning to move through the House and Senate, the cornerstone of Parson’s first legislative session is being picked apart.Last week, the plan hit a speed bump in the Senate after more than three hours of debate. In the House, lawmakers siphoned more than $4 million away from the program for other purposes.

Part of the reason for the turbulence is penny-pinching by legislative budget writers. Revenue collections as of Thursday were down more than 5 percent, or $310 million, from the same point last year.Budget officials expect collections to pick up, but lawmakers are nervous about revenue flow as thousands of Missourians begin to see surprise tax bills because of a Department of Revenue withholding error. And, the effects of a 2014 tax cut Parson voted for as a state senator are coming into focus.Analysts say the tax cut could cost $320 million in revenue next fiscal year, which begins July 1.














        
            Messenger: The accidental governor inherits a broken budget. What is he to do?



Another factor is that Parson’s administration must guide the proposal through the Legislature, which is filled with 190 lawmakers with individual priorities.So far, officials are playing down the speed bumps, saying that’s just the normal process that bills go through when they are being vetted.“We’ve got a lot of time left and I fully expect that to pass before the middle of May,” said Senate Majority Floor Leader Caleb Rowden, R-Columbia.Parson, who took over in June, has made workforce development a key plank in his first legislative session. The money is included in the $30 billion budget proposal he unveiled Jan. 16.He says the top priority for most businesses in picking a location is the quality of the workforce. Parson believes companies may be bypassing Missouri because of a shortage of trained workers.The end-product of the so-called “Fast Track” program, if approved, will likely differ from what Parson proposed.During floor debate on Tuesday, Sen. Jason Holsman, D-Kansas City, attempted to insert a provision to cap tuition costs at $10,000 per semester so all the money wouldn’t go to more expensive private schools. Later, his proposal was further tweaked to mirror tuition costs at the state’s flagship institution of higher education, the University of Missouri.Senators also wanted to require out-of-state students to repay the money if they don’t stay in the state for a set period of time.“It improves the chances that this is going to work the way we want it to work,” Holsman said.“If we provide the training, we want you to stay in Missouri,” said the bill’s sponsor, Sen. Gary Romine, R-Farmington.Sen. Bob Onder, R-Lake Saint Louis, said the added provisions would help make the program more accountable to taxpayers.“I think this should not be a flat-out giveaway,” Onder said.The legislation also says students must seek aid through the federal FAFSA process before receiving the state aid, meaning the Fast Track program would theoretically cover costs left over at the end of the application process.“Once they’ve exhausted those, then they would qualify for the grant,” Romine said.
Students must earn an adjusted annual gross income of less than $40,000 if they are single, or $80,000 per year if filing jointly. Anyone who has already earned a bachelor’s degree would be ineligible.On Tuesday night, as senators were debating the parameters, the measure got bogged down and was pulled from consideration after Rowden and Senate President Pro Tem Dave Schatz used a parliamentary maneuver to stop debate.The move drew the ire of Romine, who had wanted discussions to continue. “It was a very frustrating evening,” he said.A Romine ally agreed.“I’ve never really seen that tactic before,” said Sen. Doug Libla, R-Poplar Bluff.Schatz said the bill was put on hold because of an impending snow and ice storm.“We were at a point right there where we were not making any progress. I think it was important that we got people home safely,” Schatz said.
“We recognized that we’d kind of hit a stalemate and that’s when we tried to step back, reassess and figure out a path forward,” Rowden said.In the House, an appropriations subcommittee recommended diverting more than $4 million from the Fast Track program to fund other education priorities.Separate from that diversion, Rep. Kip Kendrick, D-Columbia, proposed carving as much as $12 million out of the Fast Track line item for core university funding, but abandoned the effort before it came to a vote.University of Missouri System President Mun Choi told reporters at the Capitol on Thursday that he wished the state would increase core funding as well as offer new scholarship programs.Though public colleges and universities likely won’t see a cut to core funding this year, core funding has flat-lined.“We need more money for scholarships,” Choi said. “We also need more money for core budget.”Rep. Greg Razer, D-Kansas City, said a new, bipartisan MU Caucus would seek to keep funding levels for public universities constant this year, as per Parson’s budget recommendation.“My hope is that we can sustain what the governor has recommended,” he said.“They’ve trimmed all the fat that they can trim,” Razer said. In the future, “my hope is that we can start finding a way to get more resources to our institutions.”“The level of support for higher education in this state, by all measures, (is) on the low side,” Choi said. “And we made that fact known, but we also realize that we are in a state where we’ve had some budgetary, financial challenges.”Speaking to reporters Thursday, Schatz wouldn’t say when he will call the Fast Track measure back before the full Senate. But when he does, he said there likely would be more changes.“When we bring that up, we have some work to do on that issue,” Schatz said. “Obviously the bill is kind of in limbo.”The legislation is Senate Bill 16.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Messenger: The accidental governor inherits a broken budget. What is he to do?,"Feb 24, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/columns/tony-messenger/messenger-the-accidental-governor-inherits-a-broken-budget-what-is/article_902c9eb3-e333-5890-ad57-f60f877565b0.html,"The accidental governor was having a hard time sleeping.It was early in the 2019 session of the Missouri Legislature. The budget was keeping Gov. Mike Parson up at night. Revenues were down, or at least not rising quickly. Expenses were going up. Budget writers had called the outlook “horrible.” Thrust into the role of having to craft a budget after Gov. Eric Greitens resigned less than two years into his term, Parson resorted to counting the state’s dilapidated bridges to put himself to sleep. One bad bridge … two bad bridges …An apparition appeared to him in a dream.

It was the Ghost of Governors Past.“Who are you?” Parson asked, rubbing his eyes.We’re the ones who got you into this mess. We’re here to give you some advice. Missouri governor's 'Fast Track' scholarship program slowed by budget concerns, skeptics“I could use some,” Parson said. “I really don’t understand. Every single year since Republicans have been in charge of the House and the Senate, for more than a decade now, we end the legislative year talking about how we created jobs and improved the economy. That’s what we did when I was in the Senate and when I was in the House. All of a sudden, I’ve got to craft a budget, and I find out there’s no money.”Sorry about that. We did the same thing. It’s what the people want to hear. Nobody wants to hear that we’ve put off for the next generation investing in the state’s future. It’s easier just to take credit for a booming economy, and hope that the cycle comes around.“But how did we get here? Even if the revenue hits our meager projections, we’re facing cuts to nearly everything. The bridges are falling apart and about the best I can do is float a $1 billion loan.”Well, what did you expect when you were voting for all those tax cuts? Corporate cuts. Income tax cuts. Meanwhile, we kept handing out tax credits to developers and other bigwigs like candy.“It sure would have helped if one of you would have prepared the state for this. I didn’t even run for governor, and now I’m here and I’ve got to close a prison, search the legislative couch cushions for pennies, threaten to take rent money from senior citizens, and maybe even cut $1 billion from Medicaid.”
The truth is, one of the Democrats in our club tried to issue a few warnings. But even he couldn’t resist the tax credit handouts and the lure of a corporate tax cut. You see, the donors want those things. And you don’t get to stay in the Governor’s Mansion long without the donors. It’s simply the reality of politics these days. Oh, and FYI: When talking about cutting the circuit breaker tax credit that keeps senior citizens in their homes, use the words ‘welfare creep.’“But at some point, when do we tell the Missouri people the truth, that we’ve bankrupted the state?”Oh, we aren’t fans of the truth. We’d advise against that. You’re on the right path. Talk about your bridge projects. And remember, you’re not ‘cutting’ Medicaid, you’re looking for waste, fraud and abuse. And efficiencies. Just keep waving around that report from McKinsey & Co. that says you can find a billion or so in saving. By the time voters get in on the scam, you’ll be long gone.“Sounds to me like I’ve got some more sleepless nights ahead. I read that Midwestern farm bankruptcies are up. More people are three months behind in car payments than have been in decades. People are ticked off that the president’s tax code rewrites are cutting their refunds.”
We’d advise against talking about those things. See, the people who will be funding your next campaign are actually doing pretty well. You need to keep them on your side. The good thing about tough times is that every time you cut something, all you have to say is that just like Missourians, you believe the state should live within its means. People love that stuff.“Yeah, but what if the math doesn’t work? What if the revenue doesn’t increase and I can’t replace the worn out bridges you all ignored? What if I end up having to withhold money for schools?”Look, don’t blame us for everything. The dirty little secret in Missouri budgeting is that the state could have $4 billion more in revenue and still be under 1981 taxing levels, thanks to the Hancock Amendment and other changes to the constitution that limit the Legislature’s ability to raise revenue. Worst part of the Hancock Amendment is the provision that requires the state auditor to report on it every year to make sure taxpayers aren’t due a refund. And so every year the auditor publishes a report that says the state would need to raise $4 billion more in revenue to actually hit 1981 tax-per-capita levels.“I could build one helluva budget with an extra $4 billion.”Well, that’s not going to happen. So just stay the course. Do your news conferences in front of broken down bridges. Pay McKinsey whatever it takes to make it harder for poor people, children, seniors and the disabled to access the health care services they need.“What if none of it works?”You’re missing the point. It’s not designed to work. Your job is to please the donors and get re-elected. By the time Missouri becomes Kansas, with an economy so bad that people will vote for Democrats again, you’ll be a Ghost of Governors Past. Speaking of which, don’t forget to sock some of your campaign money away. Our dues aren’t cheap. And unlike Missouri, we raise them every year. Gotta pay the bills.”Parson flicked the lights off and went back to bed. He still couldn’t sleep.

Mike Parson honored Foulds.During an event in the British Embassy in Washington, Parson handed a proclamation to the British ambassador to the United States, Kim Darroch, recognizing Foulds for helping maintain a small memorial at the crash site and for keeping the memory of the pilot and nine crew members alive.

“The people of Missouri say ‘Thank you’ for so many decades of honoring noble service and fostering a spirit of cooperation among peoples and nations,” the proclamation reads.














        
            Remembering the little-known actions of a World War II hero from St. Louis

The WWII pilot, John Kriegshauser, saved the lives of children when he put his badly damaged aircraft down in the woods instead of a park clea…




Foulds, now 82, was standing in a field in Endcliffe Park in Sheffield on Feb. 22, 1944, when he and other children saw a B-17G piloted by 1st Lt. John Kriegshauser drop from the clouds and plunge into a hillside. His story was featured by the BBC television network after a chance encounter between Foulds and a network news host. The host, Dan Walker, conducted a successful campaign to persuade the military to conduct a fly-by to recognize the 75th anniversary of the crash.














Tony Foulds was 8 years old on Feb. 22, 1944, when he saw a B-17 bomber piloted by 1st Lt. John Kriegshauser of St. Louis crash into a wooded area near a field where Fouls stood. Foulds credits the crew for saving his life.


Dan Walker


On Friday, Foulds, Darroch and a host of dignitaries are expected to attend a ceremony that was to include fly-bys by U.S. Air Force F-15Es among other aircraft. Two of Kriegshauser’s nephews who live in the St. Louis area were also planning on attending.
“St. Louisan John Kriegshauser’s actions that fateful day in 1944 are yet another example of why his is known as the Greatest Generation,” Parson said in remarks prepared for the embassy event, which was closed to media. “He and his crew acted selflessly to save innocent lives; Tony Foulds has acted nobly to preserve their tremendous legacy. Actions like Tony’s help strengthen the special relationship between the United States and United Kingdom.”Darroch said: “The courage of those 10 men on that day will be remembered — and not just by the children in the park whose lives were spared, but by the whole of the United Kingdom, who will always be grateful for their sacrifice.”Parson was in Washington to attend a meeting of the Republican Governors Association.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,'Political grandstanding': Missouri governor criticizes lawmaker scrutiny of tax problems,"Feb 21, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/political-grandstanding-missouri-governor-criticizes-lawmaker-scrutiny-of-tax-problems/article_8280f1bd-dd95-509b-8ede-1e7f2e1ef95c.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • After spending months casting himself as the opposite of his pugnacious predecessor when it comes to relations with state lawmakers, Gov. Mike Parson took the gloves off this week.Responding to another special Missouri House committee hearing Wednesday about a vexing tax refund problem at the Missouri Department of Revenue, the governor, a Republican, accused lawmakers of using the meetings to showboat.And he defended Revenue Director Joel Walters’ handling of the situation, which could lead to many Missourians’ either receiving a lower tax refund or a higher tax bill because of the effects of the 2017 federal tax cut championed by President Donald Trump.

“Since this year’s session began, Director Walters has testified at 10 hearings where the withholding issue was discussed. Our office is aware of the decade-old mistake that was found in the withholding tables and have worked with the department to correct the problem and focus on solutions, not political grandstanding,” Parson said in a statement to the Post-Dispatch.Trump’s changes doubled federal-level deductions. That, in turn, amplified the effects of a 15-year-old miscalculation in the state tax tables.While the miscalculation, which has been corrected, won’t affect the overall amount of taxes Missourians ultimately owe, lawmakers said people often counted on getting a refund during the tax season. Now, some won’t.Parson admonished lawmakers and taxpayers for relying on refunds, saying they should adjust their W-4 forms so they pay as little to the government up front, a move that would reduce refunds and put that money in their paychecks.“Missouri legislators’ argument that individuals should want to give a zero percent interest loan to the government throughout the year is ridiculous,” Parson said.On Wednesday, Walters again faced members of the House Special Committee on Government Accountability and acknowledged the department hadn’t done enough to prepare people for the changes.“We didn’t know how big the issue” would be, Walters said.Committee chairman Robert Ross, R-Yukon, who has led the often pointed inquiry into Walters’ leadership on the problem, said the agency’s attempt to spread the word by social media failed miserably.In a state where 3.6 million tax returns are filed, the department has 982 Facebook followers and about 2,000 Twitter followers, he said.“The memo’s not getting out there, director,” Ross said.Rep. Peter Merideth, D-St. Louis, also complained that the department could have done a better job making sure Missourians understood the effects of the changes.“It seems like we did a disservice to our constituents,” Merideth said.But Parson said he believed Walters had successfully notified top state officials and the public about the problem.“In numerous one-on-one meetings and in public testimony, Director Walters has clearly identified the issue and shared the department’s planned process to help individuals that may be affected,” Parson said.
The comments are a departure for a governor who has worked to show he would not be as combative as former Gov. Eric Greitens, a self-described outsider who routinely feuded with members of the Legislature before he resigned last June.Since taking office, Parson has made it a practice to visit with members of the Legislature, where he served before being elected lieutenant governor in 2016.In the statement to the newspaper, Parson said he had a lengthy record of fighting for lower taxes, including signing into law the nation’s 14th-lowest tax rate.The governor “fundamentally believes that individuals should keep more of their hard-earned money,” the statement said. “Both the Tax Cuts and Job Act signed by President Trump and latest state income tax cut will benefit millions of Missourians.”In the committee, Walters outlined a number of different examples of how the federal changes, combined with the updated tax tables, might affect taxpayers when they file their returns.
Under one scenario, a married couple making a total of $100,000 and each claiming one dependent would see their refund go to $67 for 2018 from $516 for 2017.A single filer with no dependents making $36,000 annually would face a tax bill of $58 for 2018, rather than a refund of $53 as in 2017.House Speaker Elijah Haahr, R-Springfield, said Thursday that Parson’s criticism would not stop the chamber from continuing to press Walters.“We are the people’s body and give all Missourians a voice in state government. A core constitutional function of the elected Legislature is to have oversight over the unelected bureaucracy. The committee will continue to fully examine the actions by the Department of Revenue that are impacting taxpayers and state revenue, and to protect Missourians from experiencing this type of pain again,” Haahr said.Ross, who has scheduled a third committee meeting on the issue for next Wednesday, also expressed disappointment with Parson.“It is unfortunate that the executive branch is confusing grandstanding with standing up for the taxpayers, but we will never back down from doing our job,” Ross said.House Minority Leader Crystal Quade, D-Springfield, called Parson’s rebuke “deeply disappointing.”“Most Missourians are not certified public accountants or tax policy experts, and since they never needed to change their withholding information in previous years, it is unreasonable to expect they should have known to do so without Governor Parson’s Department of Revenue making robust efforts to inform them, which it completely failed to do,” Quade said. “Right now, we must do everything possible to help the countless Missourians who are wondering how to pay tax bills they didn’t know they were going to owe.”“I don’t have a problem with what the House is doing,” said Senate Minority Leader Gina Walsh, D-Bellefontaine Neighbors. “I don’t think it’s grandstanding. We are asking questions that should be asked.”Missouri’s governors

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Purina investing $115 million to expand Missouri Tidy Cats litter plant,"Feb 21, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/business/local/purina-investing-million-to-expand-missouri-tidy-cats-litter-plant/article_085091e4-e898-551e-ab75-89889546c054.html,"Nestlé Purina PetCare, which has its North American headquarters in St. Louis, is spending $115 million to expand a manufacturing plant in Bloomfield, Mo., that makes Tidy Cats litter.The half-million-square-foot Bloomfield plant about 150 miles south of St. Louis has 340 employees. The new 110,000-square-foot expansion of the plant will add 30 jobs by mid-2020, the company said Thursday. The Bloomfield facility is led by factory manager Jeff Goodmanson.Tidy Cat’s 18 percent sales growth over the past four years prompted the expansion to significantly increase production of Tidy Cats LightWeight cat litter and Tidy Cats scoop cat litter, according to Purina, a unit of Swiss-based Nestlé SA. Recently, Nestlé has invested heavily in its high-growth food and beverage categories.

“Tidy Cats is a significant growth driver for Purina’s U.S. business as more and more pet owners demand a trusted, high-performing litter product,” Vicki Felker, vice president and general manager of Purina’s Litter Division, said in a statement. “This expansion reflects an investment in our local operations and our commitment to continue delivering innovative and highly effective pet care products for cat owners.”
Purina, which makes Dog Chow, Friskies and other products for pets, invested $475 million in its U.S. factories in 2018, including $215 million in Missouri over the past four years, where it employs more than 3,500 people.“Purina’s job growth in Missouri for 125 years proves the company’s commitment to the state and the people who call it home,” Missouri Gov. Mike Parson said in a statement. “Expansions and job growth like this are essential for Missouri moving forward, and we appreciate Purina’s significant investment in the state.

As the parent company looks to focus on its most profitable businesses, Purina is growing in St. Louis.




In 2017, Purina announced plans to open a $320 million pet food distribution facility in Hartwell, Ga., its first new U.S. plant in two decades. The Hartwell plant, which will open later this year, is expected to create 240 jobs by 2023.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Safety or shake down? Required vehicle inspections targeted by Missouri House,"Feb 20, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/safety-or-shake-down-required-vehicle-inspections-targeted-by-missouri/article_c9f323b8-c1de-5522-bb07-4e7c1e9fb06f.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Missouri lawmakers on Wednesday voted to do away with many required vehicle inspections in the state, a move proponents said motorists would appreciate because they would no longer need to carve out time for the mandatory checkups.Opponents of the measure in the GOP-controlled Missouri House blasted the move as an anti-safety proposal that would lead to more accidents and cost the state much-needed revenue.Under the proposal, every-other-year inspections of noncommercial vehicles that are older than five years would be dropped, although St. Louis drivers would still be required to undergo emissions inspections.

The measure received initial approval in the Missouri House on a voice vote, though opponents were audibly louder than proponents. The measure still must receive final approval in the House, and then clear the Senate, before Gov. Mike Parson considers it.“I’m concerned about the safety aspect of this,” said Rep. Becky Ruth, R-Festus.The proposal could also cost the state $3.8 million in revenue, according to a nonpartisan fiscal analysis, though the state would likely save some money by increasing some fees and running a less-robust inspection regime.














        
            Missouri lawmakers looking at higher vehicle fees to pay for road and bridge repairs

JEFFERSON CITY • The defeat of an increase in Missouri’s gasoline tax has lawmakers consider…




The state’s vehicle safety inspection program is funded by charging inspectors $1.50 for each safety inspection sticker.“We know our budget’s tight,” Ruth said. “We’re looking at everything we can to improve our roads and bridges.”Licensed inspectors can now charge $12 for each vehicle inspected, and $10 for each motorcycle inspected. Doing away with the requirement would mean businesses could take a $30 million annual hit, according to the analysis.
Because of that loss in business income, sales tax revenue and income tax collected could also suffer, the analysis said.Groups such as the Alliance of Automotive Service Providers of Missouri and the Missouri Tire Industry Association voiced opposition to the proposal during a House committee hearing.
Rep. J. Eggleston, R-Maysville, who sponsored the legislation, said the inspection requirement represents a “significant burden” to Missourians. He said in addition to paying the $12, motorists also have to take time off work to get the inspection.He also said that if he thought the legislation would negatively impact safety, he would not have proposed the bill.Rep. Dottie Bailey, R-Eureka, said drivers should take “personal responsibility” and get their cars inspected on their own.“I think this is more of a shake down upon Missourians to collect more money,” she said. “I’ve never heard anybody, go, ‘Yes! I have to go get my inspection today.’”Rep. Randy Pietzman, R-Troy, said that if the system as it exists were perfect, he would vote against eliminating the requirement. But, he said drivers now find ways to skirt the law.“If you know the right guy to go to, you can get a sticker,” Pietzman said.The legislation is House Bill 451.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Savings from Missouri's tax credit shift are not factoring into the budget,"Feb 18, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/savings-from-missouri-s-tax-credit-shift-are-not-factoring/article_905f3b1e-5546-5b0f-a50c-bc9aa3b9548f.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Although a Senate proposal to cap spending on low-income housing tax credits could save the state as much as $600 million over the next decade, a key budget writer says he is not counting on that money as he crafts Missouri’s next spending plan.Sen. Dan Hegeman, who chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee, said the potential savings could eventually be spent on any number of programs, including offsetting the rising cost of health care for the poor or boosting funds for education.The savings also could make it more palatable for lawmakers to move forward with Gov. Mike Parson’s plan to take out a $350 million loan to rebuild or replace 250 bridges across the state, but Hegeman and Senate Majority Floor Leader Caleb Rowden, R-Columbia, said they aren’t connecting the two issues.

“I don’t see the two tied together,” said Hegeman, R-Cosby. “It really just puts money in the general revenue fund.”On Wednesday, after more than three hours of negotiations, the Senate gave preliminary approval to a plan to limit the amount of money the state spends to give tax credits to developers to build low-income housing.Funding for the tax credits would be capped at 72.5 percent of what the state receives in federal tax credits. That amounts to a savings of about $600 million over 10 years.The action came after Parson had urged the Legislature to reform the oft-criticized program, which was shut down by former Gov. Eric Greitens in 2017. The former governor claimed the money was being sent to wealthy developers with little oversight, forcing the state to cut spending on other programs.Parson was heavily involved in the talks, sending his chief of staff, Aaron Willard, and his legislative liaison, former Rep. Justin Alferman, R-Hermann, to the Senate corridors to help shepherd a deal across the finish line.Lobbyists for the powerful industry also patrolled the hallways, hoping to keep the deal alive.Hegeman had started negotiations by offering a cut of 50 percent. As the talks wore on, the developers were able to get as high as 77 percent, before the number was brought to its current level.Both Republicans and Democrats believed Hegeman’s starting point was too low.Sen. Paul Wieland, R-Imperial, for example, voted “no” when the measure was moving through a committee, saying he wanted more for the program.Democratic Sen. Jill Schupp of Creve Coeur, said she also wanted the program funded at a higher level because of the benefits the tax credits provide to low-income people, as well as the creation of construction jobs.“I’m not sure the intention was ever to land at 50 percent,” Schupp told the Post-Dispatch. “To me, 100 percent was the number.”Sam Licklider, who represents the Missouri Association of Realtors, also was pushing for a higher funding level. But, the organization is satisfied with the end result.“Given the current climate, given the fact that Governor Parson says you’ve got to do something about this, I think it is a reasonable approach to the issue,” Licklider said. “I think every project that I am familiar with has an extensive waiting list. The need is clearly there.”Jeff Smith of the Missouri Workforce Housing Association said the program is an effective, efficient way to build affordable housing, save taxpayer money by keeping seniors out of nursing homes and create good-paying construction jobs.“So, we hate seeing its funding cut. However, Gov. Parson stated that he wanted the Legislature to act before his administration would reverse the current funding freeze. Accordingly, we worked closely with Sen. Hegeman and other senators to find a reasonable compromise that can restart this critical program to help the 100,000 Missourians sitting on housing wait-lists,” Smith said.While critics say the program benefits wealthy developers, the Missouri Housing Development Commission, which administers program, said there are wider economic benefits.
According to a December report from MHDC, the 206 projects awarded between 2011 and 2016 had an economic impact of more than $5.2 billion, created 35,600 jobs and resulted in 11,761 housing units.One piece of the deal could bump up the amount that developers can extract from the state.The agreement allows unused dollars set aside for nonprofit projects to be rolled over to the part of the program reserved for for-profit projects.That, analysts say, could increase the amount available to the industry by as much as $22 million.The measure could be taken up by the Senate next week for final approval. It would then move to the House for further negotiations.House Speaker Elijah Haahr, R-Springfield, said he is pleased the issue is being addressed.“What I am heartened about is that — at least cautiously optimistic about — there’s a path to once and for all putting this measure, putting this issue to rest. Since I’ve been here in 2013, we’ve discussed low-income housing tax credits every year without much movement on the issue,” Haahr said.
Licklider said he has already begun working on members of the House on behalf of the realtors. He said there is no telling what might transpire in the lower chamber.“I don’t know if there is anything easy about this issue,” Licklider said.Craig Porter, a housing developer from Kearney, was disappointed by the Senate vote. He had been appointed to a commission by Greitens that voted to end the program.“To me, I think there are better things to do with the money,” Porter said.In addition, he said the presence of rental units subsidized by tax dollars alter the market price for housing.“To me, it just doesn’t make any sense,” Porter said.Jason Crowell, a former Republican senator from Cape Girardeau, was placed on a board by Greitens to help stop the program in 2017. He said the changes still don’t address the fact that only 42 percent of the money actually goes to low-income housing.“You would be better off giving all of the money to Habitat for Humanity and letting them build the homes,” Crowell said.Hegeman said both sides were not thrilled about the final version, a sign that the compromise is probably a good one.“It was quite a negotiation between those who wanted to cut back on these tax credit programs and the developers who utilize the programs,” Hegeman said.“We were happy about the compromise we were able to reach,” Rowden said.The legislation is Senate Bill 28.

Missouri has studied ways to transform Medicaid since 2005, and the newest report ignores the obvious.Gov. Mike Parson wants to maximize tax dollars spent on Medicaid, and wants every Missourian to have access to quality health care to improve our workforce. He could have both but needs to consider options not included in the $2.7 million report.Missouri refuses to expand Medicaid, creating a doughnut hole of uninsured adults with incomes between eligibility for Medicaid and Affordable Care Act subsidies. These uninsured are primarily our low-wage workers. Being uninsured creates stress and instability, limiting the ability to make economic gain.

Numerous reports document that expanding Medicaid could save money. Medicaid funding is a mix of state general revenue and provider taxes matched by federal funds. About two-thirds of every Medicaid dollar for adults is federal money. For the expansion population, federal funds pay 90 percent of each dollar.
For example, Missouri currently provides mental health care to more than 40,000 adults, paying 100 percent of the cost. By expanding Medicaid, Missouri would pay 10 percent to 34 percent of the cost. The Missouri Office of Administration affirms that savings to the state would outpace the costs of expanding Medicaid.The $2.7 million study doesn’t have the answers. To realize Gov. Parson’s desire to provide every Missourian health care, we must focus on better serving those already insured and expanding Medicaid. Thoughtful transformation and expansion will assure that every Missourian has health care and will maximize tax dollars.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Poachers beware: Missouri proposal would increase penalties for wildlife crimes,"Feb 17, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/poachers-beware-missouri-proposal-would-increase-penalties-for-wildlife-crimes/article_1ac82da3-ca0a-5db8-aacc-9ed3d2c12cdf.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • A Springfield-area lawmaker has proposed forcing poachers to pay restitution — an initiative that if implemented could generate more than $2 million each year for public schools.Lawmakers have filed similar legislation in the past, but measures to increase penalties for poachers have fizzled in recent years. The Springfield News-Leader reported in 2016 that Missouri's poaching laws are lenient compared to neighboring states, and critics said enforcement was lacking.Missouri conservation agents said this week that two elk were shot and killed on Feb. 8 in the Log Yard area of Shannon County, bringing to five the number of known elk killings since the species was brought back to Missouri in 2011. The creatures are a protected species in the state.

Officials said the two elk were left to rot, and that poachers did not harvest any meat. They said the animals were likely shot for fun or out of spite.Legislation by Rep. Jered Taylor, R-Nixa, would allow judges to impose restitution on those who are found guilty of illegal ""chasing, pursuing, killing, processing, or disposing"" of several species. The measure singles out wild turkey, paddlefish, white-tailed deer, elk and black bears.The maximum restitution allowed in Taylor's legislation:• $750 for each wild turkey• $1,000 for each paddlefish• $2,000 for each white-tailed deer• $5,000 for each elk or black bearThe restitution would be in addition to fines issued by conservation officials.
Under current law, violators can also be charged with a Class A misdemeanor, which carries a maximum year in prison, though prosecutors rarely pursue the maximum penalty in poaching cases, the News-Leader reported.A fiscal analysis of Taylor's proposal states restitution collection could raise an additional $2.4 million for public schools in fiscal year 2021, the first full year of implementation. Actual money raised could be lower because judges would not have to impose restitution, and the increased penalties could act as a deterrent. Taylor said judges would likely not treat all poaching cases the same way.
""We're targeting egregious acts,"" he said. ""We want people to think before they pull that trigger.""Elk and black bears roamed Missouri before European settlement, and have only recently returned to the state. While black bears returned to Missouri on their own, the Department of Conservation brought 100 elk to southern Missouri between 2011 and 2013.Officials said last year the size of the herd had grown to about 170 elk, and that their range was expanding.













Andy Belobraydic broke the record for the largest fish ever caught in Missouri. His Paddlefish weighed in at a whopping 140 pounds in March 2015.

Paddlefish poachers have found success in Missouri. The fish can grow to seven feet and are known for their bills. They are also known for their eggs, or roe, which fetch top-dollar because they resemble caviar.The House Conservation and Natural Resources Committee approved Taylor's proposal unanimously this month, though the full House and Senate must approve the bill for Gov. Mike Parson to consider it.The legislation is House Bill 260.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Editorial: Troubling signs in state audit of Harris-Stowe University,"Feb 16, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-troubling-signs-in-state-audit-of-harris-stowe-university/article_f9f0687a-530a-50c2-9a8f-c4d47d366560.html,"A new state audit of Harris-Stowe State University is scathing on multiple levels of the historically black institution’s operations. From the Board of Regents to low-level payroll clerks, the university demonstrated surprising laxity in ensuring that donor and taxpayer dollars are not being pilfered or wasted. The public should accept nothing short of an unequivocal pledge by administrators to make necessary improvements.The challenges of managing Harris-Stowe no doubt are immense, given its mission to fulfill the higher-education needs of an academic community dominated by first-generation and low-income students. That’s no excuse, however, for failing to follow internal procedures and abide by the letter of the law regarding strict accountability requirements.State Auditor Nicole Galloway‘s office has been unrelenting in its pursuit of accounting and legal compliance among taxpayer-supported offices and institutions across the state. Although Galloway is a Democrat, her audits have consistently been blindly nonpartisan, which is why her Harris-Stowe findings hold credibility in spite of the university’s multiple expressions of disagreement with her conclusions.

Of particular concern were the audit report’s multiple findings of lax enforcement of policies and procedures regarding credit card charges and employee travel expenses. These are areas where funding from donors and taxpayers are particularly vulnerable to leakage and pilfering.The audit took the university to task for expensive private club memberships and disapproved expenses totaling tens of thousands of dollars by employees that had to be absorbed by the university. Even though Harris-Stowe’s credit card policy doesn’t permit purchases of gift cards, personal items or entertainment expenses, the report said, such charges were made anyway. They continued even into 2018, after the university said it had corrected oversight procedures.
According to the report, in eight of 15 closed Board of Regents meetings, members discussed topics, including funeral services and marketing plans, that are not permitted under the Sunshine Law. Public records logs were incomplete. Meeting agendas failed to indicate the possibility of closed meetings. Such apparent violations go to the heart of public accountability.
The report said payroll and personnel records, including timesheets, were missing or incomplete. Employee background checks were spotty. The university was lax in following up on students’ unpaid tuition, fees and loans.The audit called on the university to justify $15,327 spent on memberships at the Missouri Athletic Club and the St. Louis Club for Harris-Stowe’s president. The university tried to justify the club memberships as necessary for fundraising activities. President Dwaun Warmack earns more than $234,000 annually running the 1,442-student school. By contrast, Gov. Mike Parson earned around $134,000 last year.In university responses throughout the audit, officials seem defensive and quick to offer excuses. That seems more like a formula for such mistakes to be repeated in the future rather than a commitment to fix problems and do better going forward."
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri officials defend drop in Medicaid enrollment,"Feb 15, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-officials-defend-drop-in-medicaid-enrollment/article_df7f9321-3456-5e26-8df2-10974ca0daf1.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Amid a stunning drop in the number of Missourians enrolled in Medicaid, top officials in Gov. Mike Parson’s administration are defending a new system that checks eligibility for the health care system for the poor and disabled.The Missouri Department of Social Services came under fire this week after a report said more than 70,000 Missouri residents — 56,000 of whom are children — dropped off Medicaid enrollment in the last year.The 7 percent enrollment decline was the state’s most significant annual decrease since 2006, when lawmakers created tighter eligibility levels for certain groups, said Timothy McBride, a health economist at Washington University in St. Louis who heads the MO HealthNet oversight committee.

The notification system, implemented last spring, sends out an initial letter instructing Medicaid recipients to renew their eligibility within 30 days. If the department does not receive a response during that first month, several warning notices, spanning 144 days total, are mailed out, said Patrick Luebbering, director of the agency’s Family Support Division.He said the system had sent out about 15,000 notices each month since July.The department increased outreach efforts by contacting managed care providers, circulating reminders on social media and setting up automated calls to recipients several times in the first month.“We tried to think of everything that was available to us without having access to an actual advertising budget to communicate with people and do it timely,” said Caitlin Whaley, director of legislation and communication for the Department of Social Services.Kim Evans, the director of income maintenance programs at DSS, said that in the past the department had sent fewer notices and did not implement many outreach efforts.In a oversights committee hearing Friday, Dr. Bridget McCandless tagged the automated phone calls “a waste of time,” saying that many people didn’t answer unknown callers and that even if Medicaid recipients tried to return the message, the line didn’t allow it.Sen. Jill Schupp, D-Creve Coeur, said the entire enrollment process, including each future alert, should be outlined for recipients in the first letter so they are aware of the timeline.
When asked why the drastic drop in enrollment happened in the first place, Luebbering said it was partially due to the state’s strong economy. He said that when the economy was doing well, the state often saw a drop in those needing assistance programs such as Medicaid.Luebbering noted that the state’s food stamp program, known as SNAP, also saw a significant decrease in enrollment last year. He said the decline in both programs indicated there was an environmental effect on enrollment.“If we saw a 70,000 drop in (Medicaid) and I saw nothing in SNAP, we would be having a different conversation,” he said. “The problem is, we saw a 50,000 caseload drop in SNAP that has nothing to do with the new (Medicaid alert) system.”McBride said he struggled to accept the financial explanation, noting that other states did not have as significant an enrollment drop despite their healthy economies. He pointed to Tennessee as the only state with a bigger drop-off — topping Missouri’s reduction with a 9 percent decline.
Luebbering added that the Missouri department had not sent out annual renewal letters to all Medicaid recipients since about 2015. Part of the drop-off could be credited to the state’s need to catch up for those few years. Other states already had automated systems in place.McBride pushed back, asking Luebbering how sure he was that all 70,000 Missourians who were no longer enrolled didn’t need Medicaid anymore.The state’s Medicaid director, former House Speaker Todd Richardson, said that was an “impossible question” to answer. He said the state wouldn’t be able to know with 100 percent certainty how many of those 70,000 residents would have been put back on the roll unless they had responded.Sen. Scott Sifton, D-Affton sent a letter to Richardson asking for answers about the number of children affected by the drop off earlier this week. Both Sifton and Schupp said they’re waiting for further explanation at a Senate press conference Thursday.“Our first priority needs to be that we are that assured anyone who was removed from those rolls that shouldn’t have been, is reinstated and gets the access that they need quickly and easily,” Schupp said.Luebbering told the oversight committee DSS is currently undergoing a federal review of the entire eligibility system.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Government watchdog says St. Louis County Council violated Sunshine Law,"Feb 15, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/government-watchdog-says-st-louis-county-council-violated-sunshine-law/article_13ffe663-4725-55f3-bcd5-bbaebd584526.html,"CLAYTON • A local government watchdog is accusing the St. Louis County Council of violating the Missouri Sunshine Law by refusing to release resumes and applications for four people appointed to county boards.Tom Sullivan, of University City, said he wrote to the council’s records custodian, Genevieve Frank, on Jan. 14 to request resumes and applications for Kathrina M. Donegan, Julie Griffith and Vijay R. Bhasin, who were appointed by County Executive Steve Stenger to the St. Louis-Jefferson Solid Waste Management District board, and Mary McMurtrey, who was appointed by council member Lisa Clancy to the port authority.Frank responded that the records were closed because they were confidential personnel records.

Sullivan wrote that the appointees “are not employees and nor would they be employees of the respective organizations for which they would be board members.” And he pointed to a previous Missouri attorney general’s decision that says appointed and unpaid members of committees and citizen boards are not employees.Sullivan wrote that the council should be fined for “flagrantly violating the law.”Frank declined to comment.Sullivan also alleges that the council voted to override a Stenger veto in January without providing notice to the public that the issue would come to a vote.
The attorney general’s office last year dismissed another complaint Sullivan made against the council, ruling that the council did not violate the Sunshine Law in December 2017 when it filed last-minute legislation that cut $31 million from the county budget.
Sullivan had filed the complaint because the Missouri Sunshine Law requires a public body to post a meeting agenda 24 hours before a meeting. The council’s agenda posted for the Dec. 12 meeting did not point to any effort to slash county spending, and Sullivan said he felt the last minute changes shut out the public from providing input. But the attorney general’s office ruled that the law did not prohibit governmental bodies from adding items to an already-posted agenda as long as the public was informed about the new items with appropriate advance notice and the additions were not made with the intent to circumvent the Sunshine Law.The attorney general’s office is still suing Stenger for alleged Sunshine violations.In January 2018, then-Attorney General Josh Hawley filed a lawsuit in St. Louis County Circuit Court against Stenger’s office, alleging that members of Stenger’s staff routinely violated the Sunshine Law. A lawyer in the St. Louis County counselor’s office asserted weeks later that the lawsuit should be dismissed because Stenger’s office was not a legal entity that could be sued on its own. Hawley’s office amended the lawsuit to name the monolithic St. Louis County as defendant.Attorney General Eric Schmitt, who was appointed as Hawley’s replacement by Gov. Mike Parson after Hawley won a seat in the U.S. Senate, is still pursuing the suit. A hearing is scheduled for May 13.Meanwhile, Hawley is still facing questions over his enforcement of the Sunshine Law.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Hawley's attorneys say he shouldn't be deposed, in part, because he's a 'high-level public official'","Feb 15, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/hawley-s-attorneys-say-he-shouldn-t-be-deposed-in/article_43c60bef-e3dd-5f14-988c-715b80ebf83c.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley won’t be deposed by a Democrat running for Missouri attorney general without a fight.Attorneys for Hawley, a Republican who until January served as attorney general, filed on Thursday a motion to quash a subpoena by Elad Gross, a lawyer from St. Louis who is suing the state over an open records dispute. Gross is running for attorney general in 2020 as a Democrat.In court filings, lawyer Lowell Pearson, of Husch Blackwell, said Hawley should not be compelled to be deposed under oath for three reasons: Gross’ subpoena was improperly served; Gross did not adequately make the case that Hawley had relevant information to share; and, because the testimony of a “high-level public official,” should be taken only in extreme circumstances.

The Cole County Circuit Court issued this week a subpoena to Hawley at Gross’ request. Hawley’s aides were not pleased, saying the subpoena amounted to legal harassment. They promised to fight it.Pearson said that a judge had never approved the subpoena and that “(t)he judicial process does not exist to harass public servants or further the political ambitions of litigants.“It is a well-established principle of discovery that the deposition of a high-level public official is generally impermissible,” Pearson argued in his Thursday filing. He cited several cases in which subpoenas were quashed in similar instances.Gross said that such an argument would be valid if he could obtain the information he sought from the attorney general’s office, not the attorney general himself. In this case, Gross said, the only person who knows the information he seeks is Hawley himself.“Let’s say I subpoena Josh Hawley, and I really wanted to know something about something his office did,” Gross said. “That’s fine, they could say, ‘Well actually, he’s really busy, he’s a senator. You should talk to a staff member.’ ”Pearson also said that Hawley had not been served with a subpoena personally, in violation of civil procedure rules.“Plaintiff did not deliver a copy of the subpoena to Senator Hawley; instead, his agent merely left it with a member of Senator Hawley’s staff,” the filing said.
Gross said he was planning to have Hawley served personally this weekend.Pearson also said that any testimony Hawley would give was irrelevant to Gross’ case and that “nothing in the Complaint or its exhibits provides any credible basis for thinking that Senator Hawley was personally involved in the processing of the requests themselves.”
Pearson also said that if Hawley were to testify, such testimony would violate attorney-client privilege because Hawley represented the defendant Gross is suing, in this case the state.Gross sued Gov. Mike Parson’s administration in August after Parson’s office charged Gross $3,600 to process his 54-point open records request. Gross disputed the bill, and complained to then-Attorney General Hawley’s office. Hawley’s office sided with Parson.Gross wants Hawley to bring to his deposition “any and all communications, recordings, calendars, notes, and/or other documents involving you, campaign donors, state employees, consultants, and/or others” that relate to the application of the Sunshine Law in regard to Gross’ request.Gross said this fall that he was trying to shine light on the dark money mysteries that surrounded then- Gov. Eric Greitens’ administration. Hawley declined to investigate A New Missouri, Greitens’ nonprofit that did not have to adhere to traditional campaign laws and which raised $6 million from secret donors in 2017.Gross contends Hawley benefits from the same universe of donors.Questions over Hawley’s compliance with the state’s open records law continue to dog him as he settles into the U.S. Senate.In addition to Gross’ complaint, one of Hawley’s top aides, Daniel Hartman, in 2017 did not turn over records that existed to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Hartman denied wrongdoing and said the office processed each Sunshine request in “good faith.”

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri should increase funding to pay direct support professionals,"Feb 14, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/mailbag/missouri-should-increase-funding-to-pay-direct-support-professionals/article_b500e99c-c4a1-5bae-99d2-f89294fa313f.html,"The article ""Disability services have improved across Missouri"" (Jan. 28) showed that the state's services have risen to be among nation's best. However, this article fails to disclose crucial issues that people with developmental disabilities face.The change in Missouri’s ranking for disability services from one of the worst to one of the best is due to high-quality services offered by community-based organizations. The same organizations are experiencing a direct support professional workforce crisis. This person assists a person with a disability to perform functional day-to-day tasks and is the lifeline for people with disabilities. Without these services, many people with disabilities would be warehoused in large institutions.The average wage for Missouri’s 15,000 direct support professionals is only $9.71 an hour. One out of four live below the poverty line and receive public assistance. The community-based organizations’ ability to pay competitive wages to these professionals is hindered by reimbursement rates from the state that are up to 40 percent below market. These numbers begin to explain Missouri’s dismal 25 percent job vacancy rate for direct support professionals, 50 percent annual turnover rate and millions of dollars in overtime payments.

We applaud Gov. Mike Parson’s acknowledgment that our services are in critical need of increased funding. While his proposed budget allocates an additional $12 million, this is only a fraction of what is needed for providers to retain and recruit the people necessary to provide these services.
We call upon our legislators to allocate $76.5 million in general revenue dollars in the Department of Mental Health Budget. This funding will secure competitive pay increases for the workforce that provides essential services to Missourians with developmental disabilities.Please help providers ensure we can continue our critical work.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri Senate endorses tax credit plan axed by Greitens,"Feb 13, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-senate-endorses-tax-credit-plan-axed-by-greitens/article_234326f9-7fc1-5ab1-acb7-1460a110ba59.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • After more than a year in political limbo, Missouri could be back on track to offer developers tax credits to develop low-income housing.After nearly four hours of debate, members of the Missouri Senate voted to give preliminary approval to a plan that would offer an estimated $115 million in tax credits in the fiscal year beginning July 1.That represents a hard-fought compromise over what had been first proposed by Sen. Dan Hegeman, R-Cosby, who had earlier supported a lower rate but faced backlash from developers who wanted more.

Under the plan, funding for the tax credits would be capped at 72.5 percent of what the state receives in federal tax credits. That amounts to a savings of more than $550 million over 10 years.Hegeman said the higher number was needed to secure the votes.“It brought some support on that wasn’t there before,” Hegeman said. “We’re trying to get this program back up and running.”
Gov. Mike Parson has urged the Legislature to reform the oft-criticized program, which was shut down by former Gov. Eric Greitens in 2017. The former governor claimed the money was being sent to developers with little oversight, forcing the state to cut spending on other programs.Parson opposed Greitens’ move.
Some members opposed the credits altogether, saying the state shouldn’t be subsidizing construction for low-income people.The credits have long been criticized as favoring developers. State Auditor Nicole Galloway, a Democrat, found about $150 million in low-income state credits are redeemed a year. Long term, about $1.3 billion are outstanding and obligated to developers, meaning they will be redeemed in future years.The credits help developers offset the cost of building housing for the working poor and older residents. Defenders of relaunching the program say it helps transform neighborhoods at a reasonable cost and creates construction jobs.The legislation is Senate Bill 28.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Food and health care access fuel workforce development,"Feb 13, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/columnists/food-and-health-care-access-fuel-workforce-development/article_fadd12fa-8483-53d7-a297-07cfcf58d9d2.html,"“Pediatricians are the ultimate witnesses to failed social policy.”— Dr. Paul WiseAs a pediatrician in St. Louis, I see failed policy every day at the youth center, The Spot, where I work. Last year we served more than 3,000 young people. Many are affected by factors called the social determinants of health — powerful forces on our health and well-being like poverty, access to food, housing, access to health care and education. Science tells us these forces are critical actors on our health way more so than direct medical care.

Since our services at The Spot are free of charge, we see many young people without insurance and who are hungry. Food flies out of our cabinets as the teen years are one of the biggest periods of physical growth. Given our health mission, we place a big emphasis on feeding young people who come — including our hot meal Mondays and food in almost every room — including our exam rooms.In the state today, some decisions send us down a path that limits children’s futures; these decisions threaten us all. First is access to food. SB 4 has passed out of committee in the Missouri Senate. This bill places work requirements on households receiving SNAP, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. This program serves tens of thousands of Missouri kids. This bill threatens to cut off families if they cannot meet work requirements. For the kids in these households — three strikes and you’re out — literally out of food if this bill passes.Food is the energy for developing bodies and brains. It is critical to learning and health. Cutting off food to children heads them down a path to failure. A recent report by Feeding America — Child Food Insecurity: The Economic Impact on our Nation — documents the effect of food insecurity on child health, education and work force development. We cannot develop a future workforce ready to carry out complex skills without food-fueled brains in childhood.
We also are limiting access to health care for our children — another set of policy decisions leading us astray from a path to success. In a recent report from Legal Services of Eastern Missouri, more than 56,000 children lost access to Medicaid and CHIP in the past year. While we can say the economy is improving — the national average is a 1 percent drop in enrollment — Missouri dropped 9 percent. This drop is from system problems that we can acknowledge and fix.Most families in Missouri are required to fill out paper forms — a process not in keeping with the federal law. The call center drops half of the calls, and waits are often over 20 minutes. Without health insurance, kids miss out on opportunities for health practitioners and others to identify early developmental issues and diagnosis and manage chronic disease, all of which affect future educational attainment and well-being.
I see this failed social policy, and it does not have to be this way. Stop the work requirements for SNAP and recognize feeding children and supporting healthy brain development is the first step in future workforce development. SB 4 is a no. Recognize it is far cheaper in the short and long term to just feed the kids than to develop work verification systems and programs.Stop the deliberate strategies to discourage Medicaid and CHIP enrollment. Use the computer technology we have to verify kids are eligible and make it so. Keep kids enrolled for a year and then reverify using the same computer systems.I hear Gov. Mike Parson’s passion for workforce development — a policy intervention I strongly support. Food and access to health care are the early intervention strategies for a healthy and vibrant workforce and a thriving future economy for Missouri. We are at a crossroads; let’s choose the path toward success, a more inspiring set of policies to witness.Dr. Katie Plax is a pediatrician and adolescent medicine physician."
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Anti-abortion proposals begin to move through the Missouri House,"Feb 12, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/anti-abortion-proposals-begin-to-move-through-the-missouri-house/article_ae283b2b-6c85-53ff-8547-a8427e55fdbe.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Republican lawmakers have advanced a proposal requiring two-parent notification prior to a minor's abortion.Similar measures have failed five times in the past. Minors currently must receive consent from one parent or guardian before an abortion.The proposal, sponsored by Rep. Rocky Miller, R-Lake Ozark, would still require one parent to consent to the abortion, but a second parent or guardian would have to be notified.

The legislation, which the House Children and Families Committee approved Tuesday on an 8-5 vote, includes exceptions in cases where a parent or guardian has been found guilty of child abuse or sex offenses.The Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services said that in 2017, 125 abortions out of a total of almost 4,000 statewide were performed on minors. Supporters hope a change in state law will reduce that figure.The full House must still approve the legislation before it moves to the Senate for consideration.A second initiative, sponsored by Rep. Nick Schroer, R-O’Fallon, would ban all abortions when a heartbeat is detected. Heartbeats can be detected as early as six weeks, Schroer said.“If it was on planet Mars, it would be life, but the fact that it's here on a mother’s belly and not classified as life is astonishing to me,” he said.  One supporter said death is measured by the end of a person’s heartbeat, so life should be measured by the beat’s beginning.Dr. Erin King, executive director of the Hope Clinic for Women in Illinois, called the proposal “an extreme and dangerous measure” that comes close to banning all abortion in Missouri. The obstetrician gynecologist explained the change would ban abortion before most women even realize they’re pregnant.“If House Bill 126 were enacted, it would no longer matter what this patient wanted, her life circumstances or what could be best for her medically,” King said.Rep. Sarah Unsicker, D-Shrewsbury, noted the legislation's cost estimate, which indicates that Missouri could lose more than $7 billion in Medicaid funding because of a potential conflict with federally mandated abortion requirements in cases of rape, incest and when the procedure is needed to save mothers' lives.Schroer said both Republicans and Democrats have criticized fiscal analyses conducted by taxpayer-paid, nonpartisan legislative staff.
“If you trust fiscal notes, lady, with all do respect, I got a house that I can sell you on Mars,” he said, later adding: “What dollar amount do you put on life?”Courts have ruled against similar heartbeat bills in Iowa, Arkansas and North Dakota over the past few years.The two proposals are among several anti-abortion measures the Missouri Legislature is considering this year. No measures have reached the desk of Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican who has shown support for increased abortion regulations.
Missouri's only abortion provider is the St. Louis Planned Parenthood clinic.The legislation is House Bill 127, House Bill 680, House Bill 339 and House Bill 126.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri Sen.

Josh Hawley so that a Democrat running for attorney general can question the senator about his adherence to the state’s Sunshine Law.Elad Gross, a St. Louis attorney and Democratic candidate for attorney general in 2020, said in a news release Tuesday morning that the Cole County Circuit Court issued the subpoena at his request.

Gross wants to depose Hawley and force him to turn over documents.The subpoena, Gross said, is intended to force Hawley “to answer questions under oath about his involvement in violating Missouri’s public records law during his time as the state’s attorney general.”Kelli Ford, a spokeswoman for Hawley’s U.S. Senate office, called the subpoena a “political stunt.” She said Hawley would seek to quash the subpoena.“It’s unfortunate that Democrat operatives continue to misuse our courts of law for political purposes,” she said in an email. “It’s a frivolous request. He isn’t party to the lawsuit.”
At issue is a $3,600 bill Gross received after he requested a cache of documents from Gov. Mike Parson’s office. Gross said he complained to Hawley’s office last fall, but he said that Hawley’s office, which enforces the Sunshine Law, sided with Parson’s office.
Gross sued the Parson administration, and the attorney general’s office continues to represent the governor’s office.Records responsive to Gross’ 54-point Sunshine request, filed in August, could shed light on the dark-money mysteries that defined former Gov. Eric Greitens’ tenure, Gross said. He said Hawley has benefited from the same universe of donors.Questions over Hawley’s compliance with the state’s open records law continue to dog him as he settles into the U.S. Senate.In addition to Gross’ complaint, one of Hawley’s top aides, Daniel Hartman, in 2017 did not turn over records that existed to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Hartman denied wrongdoing and said the office processed each Sunshine request in “good faith.”A spokesman for current Attorney General Eric Schmitt, a Republican, said the attorney general’s office would not comment on ongoing litigation.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,New report recommends $1 billion in annual savings with overhaul of Medicaid in Missouri,"Feb 11, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/new-report-recommends-billion-in-annual-savings-with-overhaul-of/article_447de4bb-3d9c-5706-bb77-81b02282668a.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Missouri could save as much as $1 billion annually within the next four years by undertaking an ambitious and potentially controversial overhaul of services and rates provided through the state’s Medicaid health insurance program for the poor, a new study shows.A 116-page report compiled by a consulting company for $2.7 million says the state could alter reimbursement rates for hospitals, doctors and nursing homes, shift more people to home-care services and better manage prescription drug costs as a way to rein in rising costs.The study does not recommend tightening eligibility rules, although lawmakers are separately considering a plan to require able-bodied recipients to work in order to receive coverage.

“Without significant changes, Medicaid spending may comprise 26 percent to 30 percent of state general revenues by 2023. To bring growth of Medicaid spending in line with the level of economic growth of the state while preserving access for participants and avoid reducing eligibility or coverage, significant savings would be necessary,” the report says.The study was launched last year as part of a push by former Gov. Eric Greitens to determine ways to control the escalating costs of Medicaid.The draft report obtained by the Post-Dispatch was compiled by the consulting firm McKinsey & Co. The company was among five bidders for the contract, three of which bid a lesser amount to complete the study.The award raised eyebrows because the Greitens’ hand-picked chief operating officer, Drew Erdmann, had worked for the consulting company before taking on his role in state government.Soon after taking office in June, Gov. Mike Parson dismissed calls that the bidding had been “rigged.”On Monday, Parson said the state owes it to its residents to take a comprehensive look at how to maximize tax dollars spent on the program.“Ensuring that each and every Missourian has access to the quality health care they deserve is crucial to improving Missouri’s workforce and infrastructure. Missouri’s Medicaid program serves over 900,000 Missourians, involves three departments and costs more than $10 billion a year,” Parson said.According to the study, total spending on Medicaid in 2018 was nearly $10 billion, funded with 53 percent in federal funds, 21 percent by state general revenues, with the balance paid by taxes on hospitals and other funds.The percentage of Medicaid funding that comes from the state is expected to grow to 26 percent within three years, but could jump to 30 percent if Missouri were to experience an economic downturn, the report says.The study outlines a series of potential changes that are likely to draw fire from the health care industry, as well as advocates who fear the state could be cutting off services to vulnerable populations.For example, the study said the state could save as much as $270 million if it were to adjust a decades-old system of reimbursing nursing homes for care.The report also notes the state could save money if it improves health care offerings in rural parts of the state, where recipients may go to hospitals for basic services instead of lower cost clinics and doctor’s offices.And the report notes that Missouri paid $186 million last year to reimburse care by out-of-state patients.Under one recommendation, the study says more than 15 percent of hospital costs may be associated with potentially avoidable complications, such as going to the emergency room for an asthma problem or being readmitted to a hospital when a surgical wound gets infected.
“(I)mproving the coordination and quality of care can significantly reduce the volume and costs of” complications, the study notes.The study comes as Missouri’s Medicaid rolls are already dropping faster than in other states.Parson last month introduced a budget calling for $50 million less in health care funding because of a drop in the Medicaid rolls. His administration attributed the decrease to an improving economy.With Missouri’s unemployment rate dropping from 3.7 percent in January 2018 to 3.1 percent in December, officials said more people are getting private insurance.The decrease of more than 71,000 enrollees over the past year could become fodder in the Legislature. Sen. Scott Sifton, D-Affton, raised questions Monday about the drop.
“The state should provide answers to ensure that no one — no child — was cut from Medicaid simply because of red tape,” Sifton said.However, Kaiser Health News in a report last week suggested that efforts to weed out residents who are improperly enrolled, and the difficulty of re-enrolling, may also have led to the decline.To complete the study, McKinsey consultants spent three to four days per week embedded in the state’s Medicaid bureaucracy, talking with top officials and reviewing operations.In some cases, they found the state could only save money if it spends some upfront to improve computer systems or beef up rural health care options so people don’t go to hospitals for treatments that could be done in clinics.The effort will be led by former House Speaker Todd Richardson, a Poplar Bluff Republican who was named the state’s Medicaid director last year.“We must now begin the hard work of planning and implementing a transformation of Missouri’s Medicaid program,” said Richardson. “While the report identifies a range of options for the state to consider — the path forward will ultimately be determined by what is best for Missouri.”Administration officials say they are on an aggressive time frame to implement some of the recommendations, meaning some of the proposals could be subject to negotiations by lawmakers as the Legislature prepares the state budget for the fiscal year beginning July 1.Those same officials, however, are not expected to call for an expansion of managed care, in which private companies are paid a fee each month for each participant, rather than a fee-for-service model where health care providers are paid for each service performed.Three companies, including Clayton-based Centene, provide managed care for most Medicaid recipients in the state.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri's shrinking Medicaid rolls raise red flag on vetting process,"Feb 11, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-s-shrinking-medicaid-rolls-raise-red-flag-on-vetting/article_c4bbec5b-26e5-55a6-936a-8904224dbfa7.html,"WASHINGTON • Tangunikia Ward, a single mom of two who has been unemployed for the past couple of years, was shocked when her St. Louis family was kicked off Missouri’s Medicaid program without warning last fall.She found out only when taking her son, Mario, 10, to a doctor to be treated for ringworm.When Ward, 29, tried to contact the state to get reinstated, she said it took several weeks just to have her calls returned. Then she waited again for the state to mail her a long form to fill out attesting to her income and family size, showing that she was still eligible for the state-federal health insurance program for the poor.

Mario, who is in third grade, missed much of school in December because Ward could not afford a doctor visit without Medicaid. His school would not let him return without a doctor’s note saying he was no longer infected.In January, with the help of lawyers from Legal Services of Eastern Missouri, she was able to get back on Medicaid, take her son to a doctor and return him to school. “It was a real struggle as it seemed like everyone was giving me the runaround,” Ward said. “I am upset because my son was out of school, and that pushed him behind.”Ward and her children are among tens of thousands of Medicaid enrollees who were dropped by Missouri and neighboring Tennessee last year as both states stepped up efforts to verify members’ eligibility.Last year, Medicaid enrollment there declined far faster than in other states, and most of those losing coverage are children, according to state data.State health officials say several factors, including the improved economy, are behind last year’s drop of 7 percent in Missouri and 9 percent in Tennessee.On Jan. 16, Gov. Mike Parson outlined a budget proposal that called for reduced health care spending on the poor, pointing to a $50 million savings because of the drop in Medicaid rolls. At the time, Parson’s budget chief, Dan Haug, attributed the decrease to an improving economy.But advocates for the poor think the states’ efforts to weed out residents who are improperly enrolled, or the difficulty of re-enrolling, has led to people being forced off the rolls. For example, Tennessee sent packets to enrollees that could be as long as 47 pages to verify their re-enrollment. In Missouri, people faced hourslong waits on the state’s phone lines to get help in enrolling.Medicaid enrollment nationally was down about 1.5 percent from January to October last year, the latest enrollment data available from the federal government’s Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.Herb Kuhn, president and chief executive of the Missouri Hospital Association, said the state’s efforts to verify Medicaid eligibility could be tied to an increase in the number of people without coverage that hospitals are seeing.“When we see over 50,000 children come off the Medicaid rolls, it raises some questions about whether the state is doing its verifications appropriately,” he said. “Those who are truly entitled to the service should get to keep it.”In 2018, Missouri Medicaid began automating its verification system for the state-federal insurance program for the poor. People who were identified as ineligible, for income or other reasons, were sent a letter asking them to provide updated documentation. Those who did not respond or could not prove their eligibility were dropped.The state does not know how many letters it sent or how many people responded, said Rebecca Woelfel, spokeswoman for the Missouri Department of Social Services, which oversees Medicaid. She said Missouri Medicaid enrollees were given 10 days to respond.Woelfel cited the new eligibility system, the improved economy and Congress rescinding the federal tax penalty for people who lack insurance as factors behind the decline in enrollment.Missouri’s unemployment rate dropped from 3.7 percent in January 2018 to 3.1 percent in December as the number of unemployed people fell by about 17,000.
Missouri Medicaid had almost 906,000 people enrolled as of December, down from more than 977,000 in January 2018, according to state data. About two-thirds of those enrolled are children or pregnant women.Timothy McBride, a health economist at Washington University in St. Louis who heads a Missouri Medicaid advisory board, said the state’s eligibility system has made it too difficult for people to stay enrolled. Since low-income people move or may be homeless, their mailing addresses may be inaccurate. Plus, many don’t read their mail or may not understand what was required to stay enrolled, he added.“I worry some people are still eligible but just did not respond, and the next time they need health care they will show up with their Medicaid card and find out they are not covered,” McBride said.Tennessee’s Medicaid enrollment fell from 1.48 million in January 2018 to 1.35 million in December, according to state data. Tennessee Medicaid spokeswoman Kelly Gunderson credits a healthy job market. The state’s unemployment rate was relatively stable last year at under 4 percent.“Tennessee is experiencing a state economy that continues to increase at what appears to be near-historic rates, which is positively impacting Tennesseans’ lives and, in some cases, decreasing their need to access health insurance through the state’s Medicaid” program and the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), she said.
She added that the state has a “robust appeals process” for anyone who was found ineligible by the state’s reverification system.The Tennessee Justice Center, an advocacy group, has worked with hundreds of families in the past year trying to restore their Medicaid coverage. The verification process will make “Medicaid rolls smaller and saves money, and that’s a poor way for the state to measure success,” said Michele Johnson, executive director of the nonprofit group. “But it’s penny-wise and pound-foolish” because it leads to people showing up at emergency rooms without coverage — and hospitals have to pass on those costs to everyone else.After rapid growth since 2014, when the Affordable Care Act expanded health insurance coverage to millions of Americans, Medicaid enrollment nationally started to fall, declining from 74 million in January 2018 to about 73 million in October, according to the latest enrollment data released by CMS.Missouri was among 17 states that had not expanded Medicaid under the ACA. But many of those nonexpansion states nevertheless saw enrollment grow, because as people tried to sign up for insurance on the ACA exchanges, those meeting state criteria were routed to Medicaid.McBride, the health economist, said the steep drop is especially disconcerting because most of those affected are children. Because children are eligible for Medicaid or CHIP with family incomes as high as 300 percent of the federal poverty level, or $77,250 for a family of four, he said, it’s unlikely a parent’s change in job would be enough for a child to lose eligibility.Missouri’s 70,000-person drop in enrollment, he noted, marks the biggest single-year reduction since 2006, when the state instituted tighter eligibility levels for certain groups.Legal Services of Eastern Missouri, which advocates for low-income residents, estimates that nearly 57,000 of those dropped from the Medicaid rolls were children, a decline that is nine times the national average.Joe Pierle, chief executive officer of the Missouri Primary Care Association, a trade group representing community health centers, said he doesn’t think the state is doing anything “underhanded or nefarious.” Nevertheless, he’s not sure Medicaid officials did enough to reach out to people before dropping them.“I suspect some people are falling through the cracks,” he said.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri must develop its workforce to be competitive,"Feb 8, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/mailbag/missouri-must-develop-its-workforce-to-be-competitive/article_9bbce702-c3fe-5742-916a-45d2487895e4.html,"Missouri has fallen behind in economic performance. Even though our state has the seventh-most diversified economy and rank among the top 10 states in high school graduation rates, we lag in post-secondary degree or credential attainment.In the State of the State address, Gov. Mike Parson emphasized his two core priorities: infrastructure and workforce development. His commitment to our workforce is noted in his budget recommendations for three new programs: Fast-Track Workforce Incentive Grant, Missouri One Start and Missouri Excels Workforce Initiative.Fast-Track is a new needs-based grant program targeted at adults over the age of 25 who are working toward a certification, undergraduate degree or industry-recognized credential for a high-demand occupation. Missouri One Start is designed to provide more workforce training for new and expanding businesses. Missouri Excels is a new initiative for higher education to develop and expand employer-driven education and training programs.

The fastest-growing jobs through 2026 will be in the service sector at all skill levels, many requiring a certificate or credential. Without unified, statewide business leadership and ambitious new efforts, our state’s economic performance is not likely to improve.
The workforce challenge is best met through a coordinated effort involving state government, the Legislature, the business community, K-12 schools, colleges, universities, career and technical schools, and our communities.Change is needed to remove obstacles, build on strengths and opportunities, and develop our workforce to be competitive and to help our state and regions grow.
Missouri is ready for the challenge. The time is now.State Rep. Kathryn Swan  •  R-Cape Girardeau"
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Legislation aims to make petition process more difficult after four ballot measures pass in November,"Feb 8, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/legislation-aims-to-make-petition-process-more-difficult-after-four/article_6a4a3e68-9101-5f2b-a4cc-15671dec1be1.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Republican politicians are leading a push to make the initiative petition process more difficult in Missouri, especially when it comes to changing the state constitution.The effort follows the November 2018 election in which Missouri voters faced four state constitutional amendments and three propositions. And, a controversial effort to force a statewide vote on a St. Louis city-county merger proposal is on the horizon for 2020.A pair of proposed bills would add fees throughout the petition process for campaigns that pay signature collectors. Six joint resolutions, up from just one last session, would go a step further by increasing the mandated amount of signatures needed and the number of congressional districts in which they should be collected. The resolutions would have to be approved by voters before becoming law.

Rep. Peter Merideth, D-St. Louis, who has proposed a bill to allow signature collection online, sees the influx of legislation as a reaction to the handful of measures Missouri voters approved in November. Three of those — medical marijuana, minimum wage and ethics reform — each received more than 60 percent approval.Top Republican lawmakers, including Gov. Mike Parson and Senate Majority Floor Leader Caleb Rowden, R-Columbia, have expressed a desire to alter some of what voters passed on the ballot. During a news conference on the session’s opening day, Rowden zeroed in on Clean Missouri, which he said was “very poorly written.”“I think we’re going to have to go back and we’re going to have to make some changes to it that aren’t necessarily designed to change the intent, but are designed to make it to where it actually functionally does what the folks want it to do,” he stated.Democrats are pushing back, including Auditor Nicole Galloway, the only Democrat holding statewide office in Missouri. “Why were voters so smart when they put you into office but not so smart when they vote on issues that directly affect their government and how they live their lives?” Galloway said in an interview with the Post-Dispatch.Sen. David Sater’s bill was the first of the measures to receive a hearing in the Local Government and Elections Committee, where he serves as vice chairman.Sater, R-Cassville, presented his bill Wednesday, assuring the committee that he strongly believes there should be an initiative petition process, but adding that Missouri’s system has been distorted and now works against the people instead of for them.“The current initiative process is no longer a citizens-driven grassroots process, but a corporate one that circumvents the will of the people expressed in our republic form of government,” Sater said. “Our constitution is a very sacred document and it should not be for sale to the highest bidder.”His proposal would enact a $500 filing fee, a 40-cent-per-signature fee and an additional $25 charge per page if submissions exceed 10 pages.The legislation also would shorten the time period to submit petitions and collect signatures in years the secretary of state is on the ballot. Currently, Missourians are able to file the day after an election, but the bill would push that back 12 weeks.As of Jan. 31, 40 petitions have already been submitted for 2020.Some of the 10 people who testified against Sater’s bill took issue with the concept of a signature fee, comparing it to an illegal poll tax.“I believe there is a high possibility that such a thing is unconstitutional,” lobbyist Woody Cozad said. “It is a tax on the exercise of a constitutionally guaranteed right.”Such a fee could add more than $80,000 to the process, depending on how many signatures are collected, a measurement based on the previous election’s voter turnout.Missouri AFL-CIO President Mike Louis, who led the campaign against the anti-union Right to Work initiative in August, noted that campaigns need to collect at least 25 percent “extra” signatures because many end up being disqualified.
Several opponents pointed out that by adding expenses to the process, only the big-money groups that Sater spoke out against would be able to afford to launch initiative petition drives.Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft, who oversees the initiative petition process, testified in favor of the bill, citing a need to cut down on “frivolous petitions” in a “content-neutral way.”Last election cycle, Missourians filed 371 petitions, with 148 being approved for circulation. In a similar cycle a decade earlier, just 51 petitions were approved for circulation.Representatives from the Missouri Chamber of Commerce and Industry and Missouri Cattlemen’s Association advocated for the bill, saying “controversial issues” should be vetted in the legislative chambers, not on the ballot.Committee member Sen. John Rizzo, D-Kansas City, later countered during the hearing that some issues approved on the ballot would “never pass” in the Legislature given the high Republican to Democrat ratio. He cautioned that if those in favor of the bill start to make the process harder, Missourians will take other routes to assert their demands.
“What they’re going to start doing instead of going around because it’s become so difficult, is start to change who’s down here,” Rizzo said. “… They’re going to have [their voices] heard at some point, it just depends on when and where.”Sater’s bill was voted out of committee Wednesday.Sen. Eric Burlison, R-Battlefield, is among those who say the process to change the “sacred document” that is Missouri’s constitution has become too easy. He says issues like medical marijuana do not have a place in the document.“The constitution is about rights,” Burlison said. “It’s about very fundamental issues. To me getting into that issue is, not to use a pun, but getting in the weeds of something. To me that’s what statutes are for.”“To get into such detail about a particular product or good I think is an error. We made that error with alcohol in the U.S. Constitution and reversed it.”Petitions proposing changes to the state constitution are required to field signatures from 8 percent of voters in two-thirds of the state’s eight congressional districts. Statutory changes need signatures from just 5 percent of voters from these regions to get on the ballot.Senators and representatives have filed a combined six joint resolutions to alter these requirements constitutionally. While some proposals hike the percentage of voters’ signatures needed, others expand the number of congressional districts required from two thirds to all of them. Several change both.SJR 11, Burlison’s proposition, would require signatures to be collected from all congressional districts. Although he leaves the percentage of voters the same, the overall number of signatures to gather would ultimately rise from the additional districts needed.In SJR7, Sen. Mike Cierpiot, R-Lee’s Summit, filed a similar measure. While his would also expand the number of mandated congressional districts, his resolution instead lowers the percentage to keep the overall number of signatures required the same.He says he doesn’t want to make the process harder, just more representative.“Right now you can stay in Kansas City and St. Louis and hit six congressional districts,” Cierpiot said. “This makes you actually go out to the southwest and southeast. I think it gives a better reflection of the state.”The proposals are SB5, HB290, SJR11, SJR7, SJR1 HJR25, HJR10, HJR11.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Parson, Missouri Senate lock horns over nominee for conservation post","Feb 8, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/parson-missouri-senate-lock-horns-over-nominee-for-conservation-post/article_0a8bd7d7-6d03-511e-82bd-c1450826138d.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Faced with the possible rejection of his nominee by the Senate, Gov. Mike Parson has withdrawn the appointment of a member of the state’s Conservation Commission.Nicole Wood, a St. Francois County cattlewoman and land manager, had served on the commission since July, and was awaiting confirmation by the Senate.She told the Post-Dispatch she was “heartbroken” by the development, which came to a head Thursday when Parson notified the Senate her nomination was being withdrawn.

“I really enjoyed the time that I spent serving,” Wood said.  “I was excited to be a part of it.”The commission, which is funded through a sales tax separate from overall state revenues, was formed in 1935 with the purpose of taking politics out of land conservation issues.But, it appears politics did play a role in Wood's ouster.The commission has been embroiled in a dispute with the owners of captive deer and elk hunting operations over how to combat the spread of chronic wasting disease, or CWD — a fatal neurodegenerative disease.In July, the Supreme Court ruled that the commission had authority over both wild deer and elk, as well as those in captivity.The court’s ruling likely will mean the regulations on captive deer and elk operators that had been set to go into effect on Jan. 1, 2015, will be enforced.In addition to barring white-tailed deer, mule deer and other hybrids from being imported into Missouri, breeders face new record-keeping and permitting requirements under the new rules.The regulations call for stiffer fencing requirements and testing for chronic wasting disease when a deer older than 6 months dies in a facility.Wood’s nomination sparked a behind-the-scenes battle to convince senators to either confirm her or reject her.
The Conservation Federation of Missouri delivered a letter to senators in late January expressing the organization’s support for Wood.Wood also made the rounds in the Senate, visiting with lawmakers to convince them to back her nomination.“I thought my meetings went pretty well with the senators,” she said.But, groups that represent the captive deer hunting operators urged members of the Senate to oppose her.
“Nicole Wood has demonstrated that she does not appreciate or understand the diversity of Missouri's hunting, fishing, and trapping traditions,” noted a letter from the Grover, Mo.-based Cavalry Group, which defends animal-related business owners in disputes.Wood, who runs cattle on 4,000 acres in Iron County and manages 10,000 acres in Texas County near the Current River watershed, said she’s an avid hunter.She also said the commission’s battle with the outfitting companies started before her tenure.“I feel like I’m a good conservationist and would bring a good business mind to the commission,” Wood said.In a statement, Parson’s office said her nomination was withdrawn because the Senate did not give Wood a confirmation hearing, signaling that she lacked the support for a vote in the full Senate.“Our office has begun the process of looking at potential candidates and hope to fill the vacancy on the conservation commission in the next few weeks,” the statement noted.Wood’s ouster comes at a pivotal time for the four-member commission. In addition to her vacancy, two other members — David William Murphy of Columbia and Marilyn Jeannette Bradford of Jefferson City — expire in June, giving Parson the ability to put a majority of members on the panel.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri House votes to curtail state open records law after voters subject lawmakers to it,"Feb 7, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-house-votes-to-curtail-state-open-records-law-after/article_755f016a-97ec-5abc-90bf-2a38b5e79fa7.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • The Missouri House on Thursday approved a measure that would severely curtail the state’s open records law, though Senate leaders signaled that they would tighten the proposal’s sweeping provisions.The measure generated heated debate this week, with Democrats and open-records advocates arguing that the broad exemptions outlined would gut the state’s Sunshine Law.The changes would exempt from disclosure records of “advice, opinions and recommendations” that any member of a “public governmental body” receives or prepares.

Proponents said they were concerned about protecting their constituents’ privacy and contended they had nothing to hide.The passage came three months after the statewide vote that approved Amendment 1, known as Clean Missouri, which subjects lawmakers to the Sunshine Law.The changes exempt personal cellphone numbers, Social Security numbers and home addresses from disclosure, although Social Security numbers are already exempt from disclosure under the Sunshine Law. (There is some debate over whether the Social Security number exemption applies to legislative records.)The most controversial changes, however, exempt records “received or prepared by or on behalf of a member of a public governmental body” that consist of “advice, opinions and recommendations in connection with the deliberative decision-making process of said body.”The measure would also exempt “constituent case files,” which include “any correspondence, written or electronic, between a member of a public governmental body and a constituent pertaining to a constituent’s request for information or assistance.”The changes would affect local government officials, the Legislature and state officials.Lawmakers added the Sunshine Law changes as an amendment to a bill that forbids most lobbyist gifts to local elected officials. The House also added language to that legislation that would ban elected officials from using software such as Confide, which deletes text messages after they’ve been read.
The vote on the underlying ethics legislation was 103 to 47, with several Republicans voting “no” and some Democrats casting “yes” votes.Senate Majority Leader Caleb Rowden, R-Columbia, said the Senate would likely edit the House’s proposed Sunshine Law changes.
“This is a multistep process for a reason,” Rowden said. “They took the action they thought was necessary. We’re going to take a look at it.”He said the Senate would take steps “we feel are necessary for the privacy of our constituents” but said lawmakers should not make the exemptions “too broad,” which could result in “upending what the voters told us last November.”Rep. Shamed Dogan, R-Ballwin, the sponsor of the underlying ethics bill, also said that he would push the Senate to revise the Sunshine provisions.Gov. Mike Parson’s office said in a statement that the office was monitoring the legislation. As did Attorney General Eric Schmitt’s office, which enforces the Sunshine Law.“The Governor has demonstrated his commitment to an open and transparent government and is a longtime supporter of the Sunshine Law,” the governor’s office said. “Our office will continue to monitor all legislative proposals as they evolve through the legislative process.”The legislation is House Bill 445.Kurt Erickson of the Post-Dispatch contributed to this report.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Medical marijuana fees generate $3 million for Missouri coffers,"Feb 7, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/medical-marijuana-fees-generate-million-for-missouri-coffers/article_5415a248-0185-532e-b2b1-2ccf52f5fc8e.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Companies trying to cash in on Missouri's medical marijuana program have sent the state $3,020,000 in application fees, the Department of Health and Senior Services said on Thursday.So far, the state has received 418 pre-filed application forms: 128 for cultivation facility licenses, 226 for dispensary licenses, and 64 for marijuana-infused manufacturing facility licenses.The same company can seek multiple licenses. 

The department collected more than $2 million of that $3 million total the first week it began collecting fees in January.The DHSS has kept secret the names of the companies that have paid the application fees. The department will not accept applications until August, but entities can pre-pay the non-refundable application fee before then, and fill out the accompanying form.
The Post-Dispatch sued Gov. Mike Parson's administration last week for its refusal to release copies of the pre-filed application forms.
The department has said the text of the constitutional amendment voters approved in November legalizing medical marijuana forbids the release of applicant identities, but an attorney for the newspaper argued that the department was relying on an ""overly-restrictive interpretation"" of the amendment.A hearing has yet to be scheduled in that case.Money generated from the medical marijuana program will go to the program's administration and a new health care fund for veterans.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri lawmakers looking at higher vehicle fees to pay for road and bridge repairs,"Feb 7, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-lawmakers-looking-at-higher-vehicle-fees-to-pay-for/article_06f2035b-0e1b-5718-96fe-9abb15bb6aec.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • The defeat of an increase in Missouri’s gasoline tax has lawmakers considering a change in vehicle registration fees that could pump an extra $88 million into the state’s road and bridge fund.Under legislation sponsored by Sen. Gary Romine, R-Farmington, the fees paid to license cars, SUVs and light trucks would be based on miles-per-gallon, rather than horsepower.For someone driving a car that gets 40 mpg, that would bump the annual fee paid to the state to $90, rather than the $24 that is paid by about 61 percent of motorists under the current set-up.

Fees for someone driving a hybrid or electric vehicle getting more than 61 mpg would be $250.“We’ve had a hard time with getting our fuel tax up to modern day terms,” Romine said.The proposal has the support of the Missouri Department of Transportation, which uses the proceeds from motor fuel taxes to finance road and bridge construction projects.“This is really about equity,” McKenna told members of the Senate Transportation Committee Thursday.McKenna said improvements to fuel efficiency in vehicles have affected the amount of money the state collects.“It hits our core source of revenue,” McKenna said.The legislation comes after the November defeat of a referendum that would have raised the state’s gas tax by 10 cents to 27 cents per gallon.
The increase would have brought in $437 million per year for road and bridge improvements.The gas tax increase was among a series of recommendation made by the 21st Century Missouri Transportation System Task Force, a commission of public and private interests that investigated ways to boost the state’s transportation funding.
Among the other solutions proposed by the commission was changing the basis of vehicle registration fees from horsepower to fuel efficiency.Sen. Doug Libla, R-Poplar Bluff, said lawmakers need to find a way to raise money for roadwork after voters turned down the gas tax increase.“Being penny wise and pound foolish is causing backups and bottlenecks,” said Libla.In addition to the registration fee change, lawmakers are considering a plan that would use general revenue funds to pay to repair and replace 250 bridges.The $350 million plan would cost nearly $30 million per year for 15 years.The fee measure is awaiting a vote in the committee. If approved by the Senate and the House and signed by Gov. Mike Parson, it would take effect in August 2021.The legislation is Senate Bill 201.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Once again, Missouri lawmakers are at loggerheads over prescription drug monitoring program","Feb 6, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/once-again-missouri-lawmakers-are-at-loggerheads-over-prescription-drug/article_4fc979a2-f420-5fe6-bbb1-30eb454490eb.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Against the familiar backdrop of ongoing dissent in the Senate, the Missouri House gave preliminary approval Wednesday to a long-sought statewide prescription drug monitoring program.Marking the seventh time that the House had debated the creation of a system designed to track painkiller abuse, Rep. Holly Rehder, R-Sikeston, urged her colleagues to support the proposal, saying it will save lives.“Addiction is a disease. For many people, we can take an opioid for one or two days and become addicted,” said Rehder, who is sponsoring the House version of the legislation.

Her proposal, which received preliminary approval in the House on a 110-43 vote, would create an online database that physicians and pharmacist can use to track how many pills a patient buys and which pharmacies they visit.Programs in other states aim to prevent doctor-shopping — the practice of visiting multiple providers to fill prescriptions for drugs intended for illegal sale or use.Missouri is the only state in the nation without a PDMP.For years, the House has endorsed the idea only to see it run aground in the Senate, primarily because of opposition from then-Sen. Rob Schaaf, R-St. Joseph.With Schaaf no longer in the chamber because of term limits, PDMP supporters are hopeful the measure will make it to Gov. Mike Parson’s desk before the end of the legislative session in May.But on Wednesday, the Senate version of a PDMP program failed to win enough votes to make it to the full chamber for a vote.The measure now sits in limbo in a Senate committee pending further negotiations.Opponents say the monitoring system is an invasion of privacy.“I always fall on the side of personal information should be kept personal,” Sen. Cindy O’Laughlin, R-Shelbina, told her colleagues last week.“It is illegal search and seizure. It’s clearly unconstitutional,” argued Springfield physician John Lilley. “There is no correlation between the number of deaths and the number of prescriptions written.”
To address the privacy issues, the legislation calls for all data to be scrubbed every three years. The database could not be used to disclose medical information to a third party.And, it includes language barring the information from being used to prevent an individual from owning or obtaining a firearm, or used as the sole basis for probable cause to obtain an arrest or search warrant in a criminal investigation.Parson’s predecessor, Eric Greitens, issued an executive order calling for his own version of a monitoring program, but Republicans and Democrats said his plan fell short of providing a comprehensive approach to fighting drug abuse.
Under Greitens’ measure, the Department of Health and Senior Services pays Express Scripts and other pharmacy benefit management companies to analyze doctor and pharmacy prescription and dispensing data for schedule II through IV controlled substances.The agency then uses the information to identify activity indicating that controlled substances are being inappropriately prescribed, dispensed or obtained.But Greitens’ plan differs significantly from what is in place in other states and in local counties and jurisdictions across Missouri, including many in the St. Louis region. Those programs track when patients are prescribed an opioid painkiller, typically making that information available to doctors — a feature absent from Greitens’ order.Rehder said that although about 87 percent of Missouri’s population was currently covered by county PDMPs, only 67 of 114 counties had them. She said many small, rural counties that lack a PDMP were suffering because of the opioid crisis.Rep. Jason Chipman, R-Steelville, said he didn’t believe a statewide PDMP would be effective.“You make everybody feel good, but you don’t really do anything,” Chipman said. “It’s kind of like peeing your pants in the dark: You get a warm feeling, but nobody really notices.”Dr. Howard Jarvis, an emergency room doctor in Springfield, said a PDMP could help doctors catch people abusing painkillers before they turn toward harder drugs such as heroin.“This is definitely a step in the right direction to minimize the problem,” Jarvis said.The legislation is House Bill 188 and Senate Bill 155.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri Lottery officials fighting cuts to ad budget,"Feb 6, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-lottery-officials-fighting-cuts-to-ad-budget/article_687bc284-c043-5e98-8147-6d3f8e657203.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Top officials at the Missouri Lottery say a plan to cut the agency’s advertising budget could mean less money for schools next year.In his proposed state budget, Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican, called for an $11 million reduction in the lottery’s $16 million budget for advertising.His budget chief, Dan Haug, said the lottery is well known in Missouri and can weather the reduction.

“The lottery is very mature,” Haug told the Post-Dispatch Wednesday. “People see the lottery every time they walk into a convenience store. How effective are those additional advertising dollars?”May Scheve Reardon, the executive director of the lottery, told a Senate budget panel Wednesday that the reduction in ads could result in an estimated $35 million less going toward schools in the fiscal year beginning July 1.“Advertising is best practice for any kind of business,” Reardon said.The lottery, which began operating in 1986, provides about 4 percent of state aid for elementary, secondary and higher education in Missouri.After selling about $1.4 billion in tickets last year, the lottery was able to transfer $306 million to education in the prior fiscal year.Reardon said the goal for next year is to transfer $323 million to schools. But she said the lack of advertising could trigger a drop in sales.
“We really feel our advertising has been a great benefit to our beneficiary of elementary, secondary and higher education,” Reardon said.Members of the Senate Appropriations Committee asked for proof that the cut would hurt ticket sales, but Missouri Lottery Commission Chairman Paul Kincaid could not provide any hard data.“I don’t have a clear, crystal ball,” Kincaid said. “It’s more of an art than a science.”
According to figures provided by the lottery, the agency’s advertising budget was 1.2 percent of sales compared to an average of 1.5 percent of sales in surrounding states.It’s not the first time the lottery has had to fight attempts to cut its ad budget.In 2014, the House Budget Committee proposing cutting $8.3 million from the lottery's advertising budget, directing the money instead to the schools fund sustained by lottery money.The lottery sells its products in 4,600 retail locations across the state. Of the $1.4 billion in tickets sold, $939.5 million was paid out in prizes.In its goals for the coming year, the lottery wants to increase the percentage of Missourians who play by 1.5 percent.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Clemency for Prewitt would be long-awaited act of mercy,"Feb 6, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/mailbag/clemency-for-prewitt-would-be-long-awaited-act-of-mercy/article_19eba3b5-8fc4-5aa0-a6e9-15d62f47b32c.html,"I commend the Post-Dispatch for publishing an editorial and a commentary on clemency in Sunday's Opinion section: ""Let this grandma go home"" and ""Clemency for Patty Prewitt."" I wholly subscribe to the eloquent conclusion to the commentary by the former director of Missouri prisons,  George Lombardi, that clemency for Prewitt is ""just, responsible and compassionate.""

With the Post-Dispatch and Lombardi, I call on Gov. Mike Parson to grant clemency for Patty as soon as it can be done. As I listened to Gov. Parson's State of the State address, I was struck by his original thinking and concern for the citizens of Missouri and I cheered, along with the applauding members of the Legislature, when the governor stated that he was not interested in building more prisons.

I urge the governor to consider Patty's release as one step in his plan to correct the ills of our overcrowded prisons. Granting clemency will be experienced by her family and friends as a long-awaited act of mercy, and by the citizens of Missouri as a worthy act of justice and economy.Margot Sempreora  •  Webster Groves"

Mike Parson to grant clemency to Patty Prewitt.I got to know Patty in 2004, when my late wife, Agnes Wilcox, expanded the work of Prison Performing Arts to the women's prison at Vandalia, Mo., where Patty is incarcerated. She played one of the witches in the group's first production, ""Macbeth."" I believe she has been in every production at Vandalia since then.

She has encouraged other women to join the program and has been a leader in helping them with their work. She has written a couple of plays for the program. Her children and grandchildren always come to her performances from their homes near Kansas City.
She has also written essays and poetry that have won prizes in national literary competitions for prison inmates. She has been a leader in other prison programs and a counselor and inspiration to other women there with her incredibly positive attitude over the 33 years since what was probably, as the editorial detailed, a grave miscarriage of justice in her conviction.
Though new inmates will lose her guidance, I join the editors and Lombardi in urging Gov. Parson to grant Patty clemency and send her home to her family.Robert Wilcox  •  University City"
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Bridge repair plan garners support, no opposition, in first hearing before Missouri lawmakers","Feb 5, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/bridge-repair-plan-garners-support-no-opposition-in-first-hearing/article_4a2309b5-05e6-5520-84f5-4fb4c39d6625.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Gov. Mike Parson’s plan to borrow $350 million to fix 250 bridges appears to be on a fast track in the Missouri Senate.In action Tuesday, 17 special interest groups representing truckers, engineering companies, road builders, farmers and others with a stake in the construction industry, signaled support for a plan that would allow for the sale of bonds to pay for four years of projects at a cost of about $29.9 million annually for 15 years.No senators asked questions about the proposal. No one testified in opposition to the legislation that would finance the work using money from the state’s general check book, not out of road and bridge funds which are typically used to fix the state’s highways.

Senate President Pro Tem Dave Schatz, who is sponsoring the legislation, said the lack of opposition may be because lawmakers understand that they must address the issue of maintenance after voters turned down a 10-cent per gallon increase in the gasoline tax in November.“I think we have a consensus in the Senate and in the House as well that knows we need to take care of our roads and bridges. That we can agree on. It’s just how do we get there and how do we fund it,” said Schatz, R-Sullivan.Schatz said the measure is expected emerge from the committee process next week, setting the stage for what could be a lively debate on the floor.Parson outlined the plan during his State of the State address, arguing that, without the added revenue from a gas tax increase, he had to look at other alternatives to keeping the state’s system of roads and bridges safe.The plan has its critics. The bonds will have an interest rate of 3.25 percent, meaning taxpayers will be on the hook for $100 million in interest payments.“Not everybody is a fan of going down this path,” Schatz said, pledging to work behind the scenes to secure the votes for passage.“Maybe we can avoid those fights on the floor and try to address those issues in the backroom,” Schatz said.The proposal also appears to limit the possibility of political tinkering by lawmakers by leaving the selection process for the targeted bridges in the hands of regional transportation commissions.
A list of projects released by Parson shows 8 percent of the total being spent  in the St. Louis region, even though the area is the most populated in the state.In the first year of the program, MoDOT would oversee three bridge replacement projects in the St. Louis area worth a total of $8.3 million.They include the $1.2 million replacement of a bridge on Ladue Road over Hibler Creek in Creve Coeur; a $2.7 million replacement of a bridge over Happy Sac Creek in Franklin County; and a $4.4 million replacement project at the intersection of Valley Dell Drive and Gravois Road in Jefferson County.
Projects in later years include replacing the North Broadway bridge over Interstate 44 in St. Louis and the replacement of the Missouri Highway 47 bridge over Interstate 44 in St. Clair in Franklin County.Parson opposes attempts by lawmakers to insert their own pet projects into the list.The list of 250 bridges comes from a broader statewide construction plan of priority projects already slated for repair that was chosen by regional and metropolitan planning commissions, Transportation Department Director Patrick McKenna said. From that list, Parson worked with the department to identify bridges that could be completed quickly and for less than $8 million.McKenna said keeping the per-project price tag low means more bridges can be repaired. But he said that also means it tends to go toward projects in rural areas, where bridges often are smaller and less expensive to fix.The Missouri Farm Bureau testified in support of the process, saying it wouldn’t be fair to let pork barrel politics seep into the selection of which bridges are fixed.“We think that’s an important part of this,” said BJ Tanksley.The legislation is Senate Concurrent Resolution 14.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Bill would require two-parent notification for abortion in Missouri,"Feb 5, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/bill-would-require-two-parent-notification-for-abortion-in-missouri/article_82fad98f-1f9a-5847-b959-650b75a3e44a.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Missouri lawmakers are again debating a proposal requiring the parent of a daughter younger than 18 seeking an abortion to notify the other “custodial parent or guardian” of the procedure.The legislation, which has failed to advance five previous times, is among at least one dozen abortion-related measures pending in the Republican-led Legislature this year.The proposal, sponsored by Rep. Rocky Miller, R-Lake Ozark, would alter current law, in which a physician must get informed written consent from one parent or guardian.

There would be some exceptions to adding a second parent to the notification process, such as a parent or guardian who is a sex offender or has been found guilty of child abuse.Supporters said the change could reduce the number of abortions. In 2017, the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services reported that 125 abortions were performed on girls under 18 out of a total of nearly 4,000 statewide.“These types of laws do save lives,” said Samuel Lee, director of Campaign Life Missouri. “Moms and dads need to be involved in the lives of their children — no matter how messy life can be sometimes.”“We hope this is the year that it passes,” said Susan Klein, executive director of Missouri Right to Life.But, abortion rights proponents argued the change could put a young woman’s life in danger, by forcing her to confront an abusive or angry parent.“In the real world, we cannot legislate perfect families,” said Sean Whiting, legislative director for Planned Parenthood Advocates in Missouri.He said the proposal also would erect a barrier to patients seeking “timely care.”In previous years, similar measures were approved by the House, but were not taken up by the Senate.Other abortion-related proposals awaiting hearings in the House and Senate this session include legislation requiring physicians to perform a fetal heartbeat detection test before performing an abortion in most cases. Except in cases of medical emergency, the physician would then be prevented from performing the abortion if a heartbeat were detected.Similar heartbeat bills have been introduced in more than a dozen states over the past six years. But, the courts have ruled against the bans in Arkansas, North Dakota and Iowa.
Gov. Mike Parson would not say last week if he supports the proposal, but said he is “pro-life.”Rep. Tom Hurst, R-Meta, introduced legislation prohibiting a person from knowingly taking a minor out of state to obtain an abortion without consent from the minor's parent or guardian. The bill is identical to legislation proposed each of the past two years.Another bill, House Bill 540, requires certain health care professionals who make referrals for abortions to first conduct a ""risk evaluation"" for the patient.
The risk evaluation would include any physical, psychological or situational factors which would increase the risks of the patient experiencing physical or emotional reactions to the abortion.Rep. Mike Moon, R-Ash Grove, introduced a resolution to outlaw abortion, saying states should stop attempting to limit abortion, but rather just stop it altogether.“It’s time to draw the proverbial line in the sand and take a principled stand to protect life,” Moon said.The parental consent legislation is House Bill 127.

Jean Evans 




Rep. Jean Evans was elected to her second term last November. She represents the 99th District. Evans told the Post-Dispatch she would resign this week.

Evans' departure will allow Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican, to schedule a special election, likely setting up a high-profile contest in one of St. Louis County's few competitive legislative districts.Evans beat Democrat Mike LaBozzetta in November, taking 53 percent of the vote compared to his 47 percent.
“Representing a key swing district in St. Louis County, Jean has proven time and again that she knows what it takes to win votes from diverse segments across our state,"" Parson said in a statement. ""She’s exactly the leader our Republican Party needs today and I’m happy to welcome her as Executive Director.”
Evans will replace Ray Bozarth as executive director.She had just recently been named the chairwoman of the House Economic Development Committee.Evans was a business consultant and financial adviser prior to her first election in 2016, according to the news release. She also has worked for Westminster Christian Academy in Town and Country.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Editorial: Virginia Gov. Northam cannot recover from racist yearbook depiction. He's done.,"Feb 4, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-virginia-gov-northam-cannot-recover-from-racist-yearbook-depiction/article_9c190ea1-7f71-5b18-80d2-bee9576f41f7.html,"There is no question that Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam needs to resign. On Friday, the Democrat admitted to appearing in a 1984 medical school yearbook photo that depicted one man in blackface and another dressed in a Ku Klux Klan costume. That should have ended the discussion.Then on Saturday, he recanted, declaring he was not in the photo. But he confessed to once putting shoe polish on his face while dressed as Michael Jackson. Northam almost demonstrated his “moonwalk” routine before his wife smartly intervened.He still refuses to resign despite overwhelming condemnation from Democrats and Republicans alike, both within Virginia and across the country.

An ugly trend later developed as some Democrats quietly began pumping the brakes. One was former Virginia Gov. L. Douglas Wilder, who tweeted, “The choice of his continuing in office is his to make.”Other leading Democrats, including Virginia Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax, Sens. Mark R. Warner and Tim Kaine, and Rep. Robert C. Scott, also sat on the fence until after the Saturday press conference. All but Fairfax issued calls for Northam’s resignation.As Northam’s would-be successor, Fairfax was probably correct to stay out of the fray. During months of controversy in Missouri surrounding Gov. Eric Greitens, then-Lt. Gov. Mike Parson also avoided commentary.
Former Virginia Rep. Jim Moran called for “redemption,” not resignation: “Even if the worst-case scenario is true, is it not possible that the power of redemption might present an even greater opportunity for Virginia to heal from its original sin? ... He asks for a chance to learn from his failings and prove who he is today.”The issue isn’t whether Northam is redeemable. It’s whether he can continue to lead Virginia — a state struggling mightily to tamp down its image as a haven for white supremacists — after exposure for having immersed himself in that very world.
Democrats cannot credibly claim to champion equality for women and minorities if they also appear to defend Northam’s continuation in office. Had any Republican been exposed for having this kind of past behavior, the Democratic outrage would be immediate, unanimous and deafening. Whatever work Northam has done to promote African-American issues seems more than artificial against the context of disrespect depicted on his yearbook page.Virginia Democrats are no more anxious to see their governor resign in disgrace than were Missouri Republicans when a succession of scandals paralyzed Greitens’ administration. But there comes a time to recognize the political reality.Northam is hobbled. He cannot realistically request patience from the people of Virginia while he tries to redeem himself on taxpayer time. Every time he appears in public henceforth, that yearbook page will come back to haunt him. It’s time to call it quits."
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Movies and TV shows set in Missouri aren't filmed here, but reboot of incentive program could change that","Feb 4, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/movies-and-tv-shows-set-in-missouri-aren-t-filmed/article_a28552b9-0ce0-55c2-907f-57b7b03866e9.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Missouri hasn’t offered perks for film studios in several years — and producers have taken note, shooting scenes set in Missouri in other, more generous states.But, if it were up to Lt. Gov. Mike Kehoe, the state would reboot its modest incentive program, with the goal of drawing crews to Missouri to film shows such as Netflix’s “Ozark” and HBO’s “Sharp Objects.”“I have seen the benefits of us being a film tax credits state,” Kehoe, a Republican, told reporters on Thursday.

“Lake Ozark, Branson area, would really like to work to try to attract some moviemaking,” Kehoe said. “I think we need a small amount.”Kehoe made the pitch when asked by a reporter about the possibility of jump-starting Missouri’s now-unfunded program.Meanwhile, the Legislature is weighing transferring control of the Missouri Arts Council, the Missouri Humanities Council and oversight of public radio and television funds, to the lieutenant governor’s office.If legislators approve Gov. Mike Parson’s changes, Kehoe would see his office budget grow from less than $600,000 this fiscal year to $9.2 million next fiscal year, which starts July 1.Kehoe said it is too early to know whether he would be put in charge of any new tax credit program for film production.The Department of Economic Development oversaw the program, but Parson has embarked on an overhaul of the department, shifting hundreds of jobs to other various offices.For example, 15 employees working in the Department of Economic Development will be transferred to Kehoe’s office if the changes take effect.The Legislature is also debating changes to the state’s often-criticized low-income housing tax credit program.Former Gov. Eric Greitens and allies ended the state’s involvement in the program, but Parson said the state could again issue those credits if the Legislature reforms the program.One plan would cap state funding for the program at about $70 million annually, down from an estimated $150 million.“I know tax credits are a hot topic of conversation in this building (the Capitol),” Kehoe said, adding that he wanted film incentives to be discussed as lawmakers have a “global conversation” about credits in general.“Maybe as we move forward we could reincorporate” the film incentives, Kehoe said.

Until 2013, Missouri issued transferable tax credits to cover up to 35 percent of production costs if a studio spent more than $100,000 in the state for films longer than a half-hour.According to the National Council of State Legislatures, several states have cut their film incentives since the Great Recession. In 2009, according to the organization, 44 states offered some kind of package to film studios.
Since then, 13 states — including Missouri — have shuttered their programs.Others, such as Colorado, Texas and Maryland, have restricted their offerings, according to the group.“Most states’ policymakers walk a fine line and try to balance film production incentives in ways that limit forgone revenue,” according to the NCSL, “yet still reduce the chances of losing the state’s film industry to competing incentive programs.”When Missouri did offer incentives, the state limited its annual funding of the defunct program to $4.5 million.Georgia, which still offers incentives, does not cap funding. HBO’s decision to film “Sharp Objectfs” in Georgia was in part due to the state’s offerings, a company spokeswoman told the Post-Dispatch in July.

Beyond Georgia, other southern states seem to be cultivating the industry.Brandi Hinkle, spokeswoman for the Arkansas Economic Development Commission, said HBO’s decision to film the newest season of “True Detective” in that state translated to an economic boon for Arkansas.The studio hired 1,000 Arkansans — actors, crew, caterers, hair and makeup artists — during the course of the season, Hinkle said.She called the HBO decision the “holy grail” of projects, and said many smaller projects also take advantage of Arkansas’ incentive program.The state offers a 20 percent rebate on qualified production expenditures that were made in Arkansas. Rebates are also offered for certain hiring expenses and companies must meet minimum spending requirements.She said the state does not yet know how much “True Detective” will cost taxpayers.Skeptics of such incentives wonder about the long-term economic benefits to a state, especially after crews pack up and leave when filming is complete.Hinkle said supporters of the program do have to vouch for it with certain lawmaker-skeptics.“The entertainment industry is huge,” she said. “Even when there’s a depression, or a recession, people still need to escape. And Hollywood is magic.”

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Messenger: Missouri leaves taxpayers in a smoky haze when it comes to marijuana licenses,"Feb 3, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/columns/tony-messenger/messenger-missouri-leaves-taxpayers-in-a-smoky-haze-when-it/article_49a20214-98ec-5f61-82ac-bcf0413d8f3e.html,"When it comes to legalizing medical marijuana in Missouri, secrecy was always destined to be more of a feature than a bug.Of the 33 states that have legalized pot in some capacity, medical or recreational or both, several of them have laws that shroud information that would be public in nearly every other business venture in a cloud of obscurity.In Illinois, for instance, lawmakers specifically exempted information about the individuals and companies who run and profit from the medical marijuana industry from the state’s Freedom of Information Act. In Colorado, state officials initially tried to keep similar information from the public before newspapers and others protested. Missouri, it seems, is going to learn this lesson the hard way.

The first week that businesses and individuals could start prefiling applications to potentially win a license to grow or dispense medical marijuana, fellow Post-Dispatch reporter Jack Suntrup and I submitted Sunshine Law requests to see who the potential future leaders of this fledgling business empire might be.The state Department of Health and Senior Services denied our requests. Further, state officials told us that there would be no time in the process that they would tell the public who was profiting from a business in which the state hands out the licenses.This is a big problem.Think back to the beginnings of Missouri’s casino industry. When there are a limited number of licenses offered for an industry that promises to bring in boatloads of cash, the potential for corruption is massive. In both Kansas City and St. Louis there were allegations of corruption related to the awarding of casino licenses, but the process was open enough that investigators, and the public, could connect the dots on who was trying to influence whom.Or go back further, to the cable franchise debacle in the 1980s in St. Louis, in which several prominent politicians were indicted — and some convicted — in a scheme in which they traded ownership shares in a cable company for approval of a lucrative franchise.When it comes to governments awarding business licenses, secrecy paves the way to scandal.That’s one reason why the Post-Dispatch filed suit last week against the state of Missouri, alleging violations of the state open records law in denying access to the prefiled applications for medical marijuana licenses. The lawsuit, filed by attorney Joseph Martineau of the Lewis Rice law firm, alleges that the state is wrongly interpreting a section of the new constitutional amendment that legalized medical marijuana.“(T)he provision does not say that the Department ‘shall maintain the confidentiality of the applicant or licensee’ as well as the reports or other information obtained from the applicant or licensee,” Martineau wrote, adding that the state’s interpretation “is flawed, unsupported by the language of the provision, contrary to the provision’s intent, and disregards the important public policy that the process of applying for and awarding licenses to manufacture, distribute and dispense marijuana should be open and transparent.”The campaign manager for Amendment 2, John Payne, said that the organizers of the initiative had no intention of keeping the information secret: “We don’t see any reason the name of the applicants wouldn’t be public,” he told the Post-Dispatch.
But the spokesman and campaign consultant for that ballot initiative, Jack Cardetti, now works for the industry group lobbying the state over implementation of the new law. And that organization, the Missouri Medical Cannabis Trade Association, supports the state’s restrictive reading of the amendment, he said.“The department is simply implementing the language that 66 percent of Missourians approved at the ballot last November, while protecting patients and applicants against their personal information being mishandled.”It’s worth noting that the lobbyist for the trade group is Steve Tilley, a former speaker of the Missouri House who had been backing a different medical marijuana proposal. That effort, called Missourians for Patient Care, was so shrouded in secrecy that its organizers bragged to donors that “no disclosure” would be required.Tilley is a longtime ally, donor and adviser of Gov. Mike Parson, who has ultimate responsibility for the DHSS.
After the state denied my Sunshine Law request, I asked DHSS spokeswoman Lisa Cox if the state’s interpretation of the amendment was determined in consultation with the governor’s office.“I am unable to provide you an answer due to attorney-client privilege,” she said.The proverbial smoke-filled room leaves taxpayers in a haze.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Judge orders state to release lab reports related to Stockley protests,"Feb 2, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/judge-orders-state-to-release-lab-reports-related-to-stockley/article_a022d157-9c63-509b-be02-7463600cbbd1.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • A secretive state agency must release the results of lab tests related to the 2017 protests in downtown St. Louis, a Cole County judge ruled Friday.Circuit Judge Patricia Joyce said the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services violated open records laws when it refused to release lab tests of a liquid that St. Louis County police said was thrown at them during the protests, which were sparked by the acquittal of former police Officer Jason Stockley on a murder charge for the fatal shooting of Anthony Lamar Smith.The judge ordered the state to pay the ACLU of Missouri, which sought the records, $10,754 in fines and legal fees.

The liquid was identified by police as apple cider vinegar, which can help neutralize the effects of the tear gas police use to disperse protesters.The Sunshine Law case was brought by the ACLU after the health department claimed the reports were sealed because of an ongoing criminal investigation surrounding the protests.Joyce said the health department “made a conscious decision not to comply with the law’s requirements with full awareness of the consequences.”ACLU of Missouri Executive Director Jeffrey Mittman was pleased with the decision.“We hope this ruling makes state agencies think twice about deliberately denying the public its right to know,” Mittman said.The ruling came two days after the Post-Dispatch filed a lawsuit against the agency after it declined to release records that would reveal who is seeking to sell medical marijuana in Missouri.
The department says the names of the companies seeking permits can be shielded from public view because the constitutional amendment that legalized medical marijuana forbids the release of the records.Health Department Director Randall Williams also raised the ire of state lawmakers after he refused to release information about testing for the tick-borne Bourbon virus in Meramec State Park, where a state worker caught the disease and died in 2017.Former state Rep. Justin Alferman, who now works in Gov. Mike Parson’s administration, previously said Williams used a “weird interpretation of HIPAA” to deny the release of aggregate test results.
The department also eliminated geographic details in its reporting of West Nile virus cases, citing privacy concerns.ACLU of Missouri Legal Director Tony Rothert said the Sunshine Law existed to maintain trust between the government and the people it serves.“Missouri must stop this secrecy when it comes to law enforcement-related activities,” Rothert said.In a statement issued Monday, health department spokeswoman Lisa Cox said the agency respects the ruling.""It is not uncommon for the Sunshine Law to be interpreted in multiple ways, and our only intention was to protect the integrity of an active law enforcement investigation. When we were notified that the investigation ended on July 17, 2018, we immediately released the requested records,"" Cox said.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Editorial: Patty Prewitt, a 69-year-old grandmother, deserves clemency. Her jailer agrees.","Feb 2, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-patty-prewitt-a--year-old-grandmother-deserves-clemency/article_50fafaed-5d75-5aaf-8940-553d1a912317.html,"Patty Prewitt is a 69-year-old grandmother serving a life sentence for the murder of her husband in 1984. She has been in prison for nearly 33 years and has maintained her innocence since the beginning. Lots of prisoners adamantly protest their innocence, but her case is so compelling that even the former director of the Missouri Department of Corrections asks that her sentence be commuted.“In my four decades in corrections in Missouri, I have never made a single recommendation for clemency, until now,” George Lombardi writes on Sunday’s op-ed page. “Gov. Mike Parson should release Patty Prewitt today.”There are compelling arguments that the investigation in Prewitt’s case was badly botched — credible leads were not pursued and crucial evidence, such as fingerprints, left uncollected. Such evidence could have corroborated her story that an intruder sexually assaulted her before murdering her husband.

Instead, lead investigator Kevin Hughes homed in on her as the main suspect and filtered the evidence to build a case. The prosecution also focused on her extramarital affairs from at least five years before the murder. In 1985, the prosecutor argued that “the dignity of the institution of marriage” requires a conviction. Not even the U.S. president would meet that standard today.Before Prewitt’s trial, Hughes had delayed the arrest of a suspect in a brutal rape for almost a month to let the suspect fight in a boxing tournament in exchange for a confession. In 1997, Hughes resigned his position as investigator with the Wyoming Division of Criminal Investigation after a review questioning his veracity. The pathologist in Prewitt’s case, James Bridgens, also had a track record of mistakes. In this case, three different reports offered three different causes of death.
The Missouri Innocence Project appealed on Prewitt’s behalf for DNA testing that could corroborate her story. Circuit Court Judge Robert Koffman rejected it last summer. He claimed that the DNA evidence would need to be able to definitively prove her innocence. Her lawyers argue that the DNA testing could provide exculpatory results that would have changed the outcome of the trial. They have appealed Koffman’s ruling.
Politicians on both sides of the aisle across the state support her release. She has been a model prisoner, earning a degree and several certificates, along with mentoring and training other female inmates.Prewitt was unwilling to take a plea deal that would have made her eligible for parole in seven years. She is serving 50 years without possibility of parole.The governor should recognize that this case was a gross failure of justice and that her continued imprisonment, which will cost the state upward of $350,000, is not in the state’s interest. We urge him to consider Lombardi’s words to “take the just, responsible and compassionate action” and grant Patty Prewitt clemency."
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Clemency for Patty Prewitt,"Feb 2, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/columnists/clemency-for-patty-prewitt/article_a9a17b01-6b22-5b74-a72a-ced27dc23774.html,"I served 41 years with the Missouri Department of Corrections, including serving as a warden for seven years, director of all Missouri prisons for 18 years, and, finally, director of corrections in the Cabinet of Gov. Jay Nixon from 2009 to 2016. I have met countless prisoners with a story to tell about why they should not be behind bars. In my four decades in corrections in Missouri, I have never made a single recommendation for clemency, until now. Gov. Mike Parson should release Patty Prewitt today.Patty is serving a life sentence for the murder of her husband in 1984. She is not eligible for parole until 2036. Now 69, Patty has served over 32 years and has consistently maintained her innocence. I am not in a position to know whether Patty actually committed the crime, although there does seem to be a plethora of irregularities in the investigation that led to her arrest and the ensuing prosecution. The governor need not be convinced that Patty is innocent to conclude that ordering her release is the just and merciful action for Patty and her family, and the responsible decision for the people of Missouri. Let me explain.First, some context. When I entered the Missouri corrections system in 1972, individuals who had been convicted of a crime similar to the one Patty was convicted of would have been paroled in 12 years or less for good behavior. But the onslaught of changes to the law, including the requirement to serve at least 85 percent on every sentence involving a violent crime, and the demand for sentences of either life without the possibility of parole or death for murder convictions, fundamentally changed the way that criminal justice was administered in Missouri, making it more intractable and less humane. The fact that Patty, now elderly and increasingly frail, who no one believes is a threat to the community, remains in prison after more than 32 years is a direct consequence of this move toward rigid and hopeless sentencing.

Despite her life sentence, Patty has accomplished more, given more and touched the lives of more individuals than many of us outside prison will ever achieve. Patty has earned multiple academic degrees; she is a published, award-winning writer. One play she wrote was performed at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. For 20 years, she served the state as a computer programmer and trained dozens of women in that field. She was one of the founding members of Prison Performing Arts at her prison in 2000 and has had leading roles in a several Shakespearean plays. Patty has volunteered for thousands of hours through the Restorative Justice Program, where she has engaged in service projects to help elderly veterans and abused children.More than any single accomplishment, I have been most impressed with the positive influence she has on her fellow offenders. She is clearly respected and admired for her leadership, integrity and compassion. From tutoring those seeking their GED to training women to become certified fitness instructors, I have observed Patty helping inmates of all backgrounds realize their potential. So many women credit Patty for mentoring them through their years of incarceration in ways that prepared them to lead more productive and responsible lives after their release.
The state will spend upward of $350,000 to keep Patty behind bars through 2036. Given Missouri’s serious fiscal challenges — challenges that are being acutely felt by the Department of Corrections — it’s hard to imagine a justification for spending hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars to continue to imprison a 69-year-old grandmother and model prisoner who has already served over three decades.
There is also a human toll to consider. Patty’s children, who lost their father as a result of the crime for which Patty was convicted, have urged the governor to let their mom come home.I do not make this recommendation lightly, but Patty Prewitt is an exceptional individual. I ask that the governor consider the fact of the long sentence she has already served, the total support of her children and grandchildren, and her unprecedented contribution to the culture of the prison and to her fellow offenders. I believe she will enrich her community on the outside as she has done so powerfully on the inside.I recommend that Gov. Parson take the just, responsible and compassionate action and grant Patty Prewitt clemency.George Lombardi is the former director of the Missouri Department of Corrections."
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"When it comes to Super Bowl, legal bets are off in Missouri","Feb 1, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/when-it-comes-to-super-bowl-legal-bets-are-off/article_efef1ead-da77-5162-943e-cb98d39dc08c.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • An estimated 1 million Americans will place a legal bet on Sunday’s Super Bowl matchup between the Los Angeles Rams and the New England Patriots.But none of those legal bets will be placed in Missouri.While eight other states have already legalized sports wagering, lawmakers in the Show-Me State are still haggling over details that affect not only gamblers, but the casinos that would offer the bets, the professional leagues and college conferences that offer the contests and the regulators who would monitor the system.

On Thursday, it was apparent that negotiators are still far from reaching a compromise after two years of behind-the-scenes negotiations.On Thursday, in a committee hearing room packed with gambling and sports industry lobbyists, Sen. Denny Hoskins, R-Warrensburg, outlined a plan calling for a 12 percent tax on wagers that would generate at least $6 million for education. A separate 2 percent tax would raise at least $1 million for veterans programs.Afterward, no one rose to speak in support of the measure.“This is a work in progress,” Hoskins acknowledged.The Super Bowl has typically been the biggest sports betting event of the year. But this year it will be legal following a 2018 U.S. Supreme Court decision that allowed it to be offered in states beyond the gambling stronghold of Nevada.In Rhode Island, where sports betting got underway in November, scores of people from Massachusetts are crossing the state line to place a bet on the game, presumably for their Patriots.Back in Missouri, the zeal for betting has waned after Kansas City’s NFL team lost in the playoffs.“At this point I’m still trying to overcome the fact that the Chiefs are not playing,” said Senate President Pro Tem Dave Schatz, R-Sullivan. “The fact that the Rams left Missouri makes me want to root for the Patriots, but I’m not sure I’d bet on either one of them because they are both very good football teams.”Gov. Mike Parson said he expects Missouri to eventually offer sports betting, but he is waiting for lawmakers to strike a deal before weighing in on the specifics.
“I think that’s going to be an issue that the State of Missouri has got to deal with,” Parson said.Along with reaching an agreement on tax rates, the state must also set an application fee for casinos wanting to offer sports betting.In his bill, Hoskins set the licensing fee at $10,000, with a $5,000 annual renewal cost. By contrast, Pennsylvania has a $10 million licensing fee.Similarly, Pennsylvania is charging a 36 percent tax, compared to Hoskins’ 12 percent. A separate bill sponsored by Sen. Lincoln Hough, R-Springfield, would charge a 6.75 percent tax.
Parson said he had no comment on what kinds of taxes and fees are appropriate.“I don’t know what the legislators are going to do about that,” Parson told members of the Missouri Press Association during an event at the governor’s mansion.Mike Winter, executive director of the Missouri Gaming Association, which represents the state’s casinos, said the tax rates proposed by Hoskins would leave casinos little room for profits.“We look forward to continuing the discussion,” Winter said.Senate Majority Floor Leader Caleb Rowden, R-Columbia, previously sponsored sports betting bills. This year he is not closely involved in the talks.But, he said, “It’s coming and we might as well be part of it. I’m hoping we can get something done. It’s a complicated path, for sure.”The legislation is Senate Bill 44 and Senate Bill 222.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Gov. Mike Parson hedges on Better Together as lawmakers' phones light up,"Jan 31, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/gov-mike-parson-hedges-on-better-together-as-lawmakers-phones/article_69d3b54e-be3c-5b64-b42f-36e34d936109.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Gov. Mike Parson on Thursday did not commit to supporting an effort to merge St. Louis city and county — but the state's chief executive indicated that he thought the region's fractured system of governance was not working.""When the mayor of St. Louis comes forward and says, you know, we've got serious problems in St. Louis — one of the major urban areas of the state, which has a huge impact on the entire state of Missouri,"" Parson told reporters, ""I think, one, that should be noted, that someone reached out to say we've got problems.""He said ""everything should be on the table"" for ""how to fix that.""

""It seems like the way it has been,"" Parson added, ""has definitely got some problems.""Parson's comments came days after the nonprofit group Better Together unveiled its long-awaited plan to merge the city and county, two separate entities since the Great Divorce of 1876.The proposal would leave school and fire districts intact. But, the county’s 88 municipalities would become “municipal districts” whose authority would be limited to overseeing an array of services, including parks and recreation and trash collection.When pressed, Parson, a Republican, would not say whether he supported the initiative, adding the effort had ""a lot of moving pieces"" and that it would be too early to take a position.He likewise did not take a position on whether a statewide vote should be held on the merger.Parson would have no direct role in placing a proposed constitutional amendment on the ballot, but his backing could prove consequential as support and opposition to the plan begins to harden.Supporters of the effort — including St. Louis Mayor Lyda Krewson and St. Louis County Executive Steve Stenger — argue that the consolidation will save taxpayer money, lead to safer communities and spark greater business investment.But mayors of various municipalities and others have criticized Better Together — and the proposed statewide vote, which could impose the ""metro city"" vision even if the majority of city and county voters reject it.""I certainly agree that working together adds value to our region,"" said state Rep. Dean Plocher, R-Des Peres, ""but when it requires a statewide vote to force it down the throats of the county, my constituents and the city, I don't think that's good politics, I don't think it's good policy, and I think it runs contrary to the idea of good governance.Plocher said his phone ""lit up"" when the Better Together proposal was unveiled.""Quite honestly I'm not aware of anyone supporting it,"" Plocher said of his constituents.Democratic Rep. Bob Burns represents parts of south St. Louis and parts of the Lemay area in St. Louis County.
Burns said that he was initially ""totally opposed"" to a merger, but he said he was ""a little bit more comfortable"" with the idea after this week's presentation.""I'm receptive but I'm not going to say I'm for it,"" Burns said. He said detailing how a metro city would address crime in St. Louis — and the perception of crime in the city — needed to be discussed as part of any effort to gain public support for the initiative.Burns said his constituents who lived in the county were more likely to voice opposition than his constituents who lived in the city.Rep. Gina Mitten, D-Richmond Heights, said many of her constituents are most worried about out-state voters imposing their will on the city and county.Conversely, some of her constituents who support Better Together worry the only way a merger will happen is if out-state voters weigh in.
""I would say that that's a minority,"" she said of the latter group.Some lawmakers have floated ways to counter the statewide vote proposal.Mitten, whose district also includes parts of the city and county, said an alternative to a statewide vote forcing a merger could be a statewide vote that authorizes the city and county to consolidate, upon city and county voter approval.Rep. Bruce Franks, D-St. Louis, proposed legislation this week that would require a majority of voters in the city and the county to authorize any merger.Sen. Jamilah Nasheed, D-St. Louis, filed legislation that would require 60 percent voter support in the city and county in order for a merger to take place.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Phishing attack reported at state government offices,"Jan 31, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/phishing-attack-reported-at-state-government-offices/article_0a5d7715-15a7-5233-95f3-16e0f9b8bf1a.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • The email system used by thousands of state government employees in Missouri came under attack by hackers Thursday.In an afternoon letter to state workers from the state's Office of Cyber Security, a large phishing attack was directed at the state starting at 7 a.m. Thursday.“The campaign is still in progress, and it has been identified that some of the malicious emails are making it through the advanced detection system into State of Missouri mailboxes,” the letter noted.

Stephen Meyer, the acting chief of the division, warned workers not to click on emails that contained subject lines with the words such as “invoice” or ""AT&T bill is available.""“If you discover an email matching the description below, please delete it from your inbox,” Meyer wrote.By late afternoon, Office of Administration spokeswoman Brittany Ruess told the Post-Dispatch that it appeared the attack had ended.
And, she said, officials believe it was unsuccessful.""Cyber security protections prevented any loss of data or information,"" Ruess said. ""However, the Office of Cyber Security continues to monitor the situation.""
The attack comes as Gov. Mike Parson has asked lawmakers for a major boost in spending on information technology costs in the budget for the fiscal year beginning July 1.According to his proposal, the Office of Administration should get a boost in funding to launch a major consolidation of various computer systems, pushing the IT budget to nearly $250 million, more than twice what was budgeted last year.The number of employees in the division would rise to 971, up from 946.As part of routine training against potential cybercrimes, the Information Technology Division has previously conducted tests on workers to see if they click on malicious emails.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Post-Dispatch sues Gov. Mike Parson's administration over closure of medical pot records,"Jan 31, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/post-dispatch-sues-gov-mike-parson-s-administration-over-closure/article_d71c7cc6-cb00-5213-be8e-7dc81ef728a9.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • The Post-Dispatch on Wednesday filed a lawsuit against the state Department of Health and Senior Services after the department repeatedly declined to release records that would reveal who is seeking to sell medical marijuana in Missouri.Post-Dispatch attorney Joseph Martineau of Lewis Rice filed the lawsuit in Cole County Circuit Court and asked Circuit Judge Daniel R. Green to order the state to release the records.Voters approved Amendment 2 in November, making Missouri the 33rd state to legalize marijuana for medicinal use. The Department of Health and Senior Services is overseeing the program. Sales are supposed to start early next year.

On Jan. 7, the DHSS started accepting nonrefundable application fees from businesses. The Post-Dispatch requested copies of documents that companies submitted with their application fees.The department has refused to release any information, except the amount of revenue generated from the fees, and the number of forms the department has received, saying the constitutional amendment forbids release of the records.The amendment says, in part, that the department “shall maintain the confidentiality of reports or other information obtained from an applicant or licensee containing any individualized data, information, or records related to the licensee or its operation … .”In the lawsuit, Martineau argued the DHSS was relying on an “overly-restrictive interpretation” of that provision to justify concealing names of businesses and identifying information.“(T)he provision does not say that the Department ‘shall maintain the confidentiality of the applicant or licensee’ as well as the reports or other information obtained from the applicant or licensee,” Martineau wrote.Martineau wrote the interpretation “is flawed, unsupported by the language of the provision, contrary to the provision’s intent, and disregards the important public policy that the process of applying for and awarding licenses to manufacture, distribute and dispense marijuana should be open and transparent.”
Martineau said other records exemptions written into the state’s Sunshine Law are explicitly intended to conceal the identities from the public.“Laws intended to maintain the confidentiality of an individual’s identity include explicit, clear and unambiguous language to that effect,” Martineau wrote, citing provisions related to child sex abuse and domestic violence records as examples.Amendment 2 “says nothing about maintaining the confidentiality of the identity or identification of individuals or companies applying for licenses,” he said.
The campaign manager for the group that backed Amendment 2 told the Post-Dispatch last month the wording of the amendment was not intended to close off access to applicants’ identifying information.“The language was included in Amendment 2 to keep the medical information of patients confidential, as well as sensitive information from applicants, such as security plans and financials, private,” John Payne, campaign manager for New Approach Missouri, said in a statement.But, he said, “We wouldn’t necessarily expect all of the application to be closed. For instance, we don’t see any reason the name of the applicants wouldn’t be public.”Post-Dispatch Editor Gilbert Bailon said the newspaper is advocating for transparency. “The State of Missouri already has collected more than $2 million in fees from pre-applications of people and companies that seek to be licensed to sell medical marijuana in the state. The public has a right to know who seeks to engage in the medical marijuana business and who has paid the state pre-application fees.”The cultivation facility application fee is $10,000. The application fee for both dispensaries and marijuana-infused product manufacturing facilities is $6,000.The amendment designates fees collected as well as a 4 percent sales tax on medical marijuana to the administration of the fledgling program as well as a new veterans’ health care fund.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Bail will go down in Missouri courts under new reform plan,"Jan 31, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/bail-will-go-down-in-missouri-courts-under-new-reform/article_09e3a26d-2c1a-57c2-b796-68bbf7aa1930.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • The chief justice of Missouri’s highest court announced on Wednesday plans to restrict courts from charging defendants bail as a condition of their release before trial.Current rules allow courts to charge amounts that can be out of reach, leaving the accused to wait in jail for their trial. Over the past year, the Supreme Court has surveyed judges, prosecutors, defense attorneys, law professors and court officials in order to come up with “common sense modifications,” Chief Justice Zel Fischer said. In his annual State of the Judiciary address, Fischer said too many people who were arrested couldn’t afford bail for even low-level offenses.“Though presumed innocent, they lose their jobs, cannot support their families and are more likely to reoffend,” he said.

The new rules, set to take effect July 1, not only limit how long a defendant can be detained without a hearing but add further provisions that limit a court’s ability to order payments in the first place.Fischer announced that courts would now start with the presumption that they will not charge fees and can implement costs “only if necessary.” The amount charged should not exceed what is needed to “ensure safety or the defendant’s appearance.”Courts also will need to consider how to minimize the charge or waive it altogether before adding any cost.“A court may order a defendant’s pretrial detention only if it determines — by clear and convincing evidence — that no combination of nonmonetary and monetary conditions will ensure safety of the community or any person,” Fischer explained.Fischer said that when judges were determining pretrial detention, they would be asked to weigh a defendant’s bail option with the likelihood they will appear in court and the safety of the community, including the crime victim.“We all share a responsibility to protect the public — but we also have a responsibility to ensure those accused of crime are fairly treated according to the law, and not their pocket books,” Fischer said.This ongoing issue has been recognized by Attorney General Eric Schmitt, who took a stand against considering unpaid jail debts as court costs as one of his first acts in office. Post-Dispatch columnist Tony Messenger has shed light on the topic of so-called debtors prisons over the past few months.
The new plan played into the overall push for criminal justice change throughout Fischer’s speech, echoing Gov. Mike Parson’s call in his State of the State address three weeks earlier to reform, rather than expand, Missouri’s prison system.Although Fischer said he had always been tough on crime, he said that mindset was not necessarily “smart on crime” anymore. He pointed to the state’s high incarceration rates.
“I think we ought to save our prisons for those we are afraid of, not just mad at,” Fischer said.The judge called on both legislative bodies to focus funding on “programs with proven results” such as drug treatment courts, an issue to which Parson dedicated a special legislative session last year.The chief justice also pointed to a gap in the state’s civil justice system, saying that many defendants “lack access to affordable legal services” despite volunteer lawyers and online programs.“By far the primary resource for those least able to afford an attorney comes from our state’s legal service organizations,” Fischer said. “Unfortunately the justice gap is much wider than these volunteer lawyers and legal service organizations can bridge on their own.”Fischer proposed a pilot program led by Legal Aid of Western Missouri Executive director Joe Dandurand and the organization’s volunteer attorney project director, Latricia Scott, that would call on retired baby boomers to help fill this need on a volunteer basis.“Many will be able to continue sharing their legal experience in meaningful and impactful ways,” Fischer said. “More importantly, our legal aid organizations will be able to help more low-income citizens throughout Missouri who need — but cannot afford — civil legal assistance.”Editor's note: This story has been updated to clarify which portion of the justice system would be impacted by the proposed pilot program for volunteer lawyers.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Getting food stamps in Missouri? Getting a job would be required under Republican proposal,"Jan 31, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/getting-food-stamps-in-missouri-getting-a-job-would-be/article_fddc9e8d-0fca-5184-b957-1a1a872e8fb7.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • As many as 40,000 Missourians could lose their food stamps under a new work requirement proposal being pushed by Republicans who control the Legislature.In a hearing Wednesday, a Senate panel reignited debate on a plan that fell short last year that would have installed a three-strikes rule for failing to meet the work requirements for receiving Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefits, which helps poor families buy groceries.The sponsor, Sen. David Sater, R-Cassville, said the requirements will encourage able-bodied adults to find jobs.

“The ticket out of poverty is work. It is not government assistance,” Sater said. “This bill simply enforces work requirements.”

“Some people just need to be motivated to find a job,” added Sen. Andrew Koenig, R-Manchester.Critics said the proposal would harm the children of the adults cut off from the benefits.“I cannot believe you’re going to put kids in the middle,” said Sen. Jill Schupp, D-Creve Coeur.“Nothing good ever comes from denying people food. Nothing will. Nothing ever could,” said Colleen Coble, director of the Missouri Coalition Against Domestic and Sexual Violence.The proposal is the latest push by Republicans to reduce the number of Missourians receiving public benefits. A 2015 law cut welfare rolls, for example. In the years since, about 23,000 fewer children have received benefits.Along with raising concerns about putting children at risk, opponents said the Department of Social Services is not equipped to handle the change.A non-partisan legislative analysis found the agency acknowledging it may not have enough existing resources to provide work participation assistance to all individuals that could lose benefits.Natashia Pickens, president of the Communications Workers of America Local 6355, which represents workers at the department, said the change could create lengthy waiting times for recipients seeking information.“The offices are short-staffed,” Pickens said.
“I’m real concerned about the lack of staffing,” added Jeanette Mott Oxford, executive director of Empower Missouri.Sen. Karla May, D-St. Louis, also questioned whether the changes could be enacted without giving the department more money.“How are we going to institute this and enforce it when we don’t have the capacity?” May asked.Other groups sounding warning bells about the proposal included the Missouri Heart Association, the Missouri Catholic Conference, Catholic Charities of St. Louis and the St. Louis chapter of the National Council of Jewish Women.
Jessica Hoey, director of external affairs for the Missouri Community Action Network, said, “We should not tie work to access to food and nutrition.”Schupp was angry that Sater and Koenig allowed less than 30 minutes for testimony by various groups that opposed the measure.The lone person to speak in favor of the proposal was James Harris, a political consultant close to Gov. Mike Parson who represents the Florida-based Opportunity Solutions Project, which is an arm of the conservative Foundation for Government Accountability.The foundation has been prodding states to enact work requirements.“It helps lift people out of poverty,” Harris told members of the Senate Seniors, Families and Children Committee.Sater and Rep. Curtis Trent, R-Springfield, also are sponsoring proposals that would require some Medicaid recipients to work, attend school, search for a job or volunteer at least 80 hours a month to keep their health insurance through the publicly funded program.If approved, and the federal government signs off, Missouri would join a handful of other states that have attempted to impose the controversial requirements on their poorer residents.In Arkansas, where more than 12,000 residents have lost their benefits since the change took effect in June, the requirements are being challenged in court.Trent said the plan would likely affect between 70,000 and 90,000 of the more than 900,000 people who are enrolled in Medicaid.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"After Greitens scuttled it, Missouri lawmakers trying to restore tax credit program","Jan 29, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/state-and-regional/after-greitens-scuttled-it-missouri-lawmakers-trying-to-restore-tax/article_0dbaafb6-e106-5a59-96f4-c40a58fbb844.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • More than a year after former Gov. Eric Greitens torpedoed state funding for low-income housing tax credits, Missouri lawmakers are taking steps to resuscitate the program.With Gov. Mike Parson urging the Legislature to reform the oft-criticized program, a Senate panel heard testimony Tuesday on a plan to cap state funding for the program at about $70 million annually, down from an estimated $150 million.The sponsor, Sen. Dan Hegeman, R-Cosby, tried a similar approach last year with an unsuccessful measure that would have capped state funds at about $90 million.

Hegeman, who chairs the Senate’s budget-writing committee, wants to reduce the amount of credits available to a level that is 50 percent of the federal credits Missouri receives.The proposal, however, remains a work in progress as lawmakers end their first month of the legislative session. Like others, Sam Licklider of the Missouri Association of Realtors said the cap being sought by Hegeman is too low. “This is a good start,” Licklider said, adding, “We need to solve this problem.”Parson remains hopeful a deal can be struck, but did not offer specifics Tuesday.
“The governor has been consistent on this calling for tax credit reforms that address housing needs, while ensuring greater accountability and an increased return on the investment of taxpayer dollars. We are confident in the legislature’s ability to develop these necessary reforms,” his office said in a written statement.Greitens moved to end the program by stacking the Missouri Housing Development Authority in 2017 with members favorable to his views. The board then voted to stop funding the tax credits.
Greitens said then that reforms haven’t been made over the years because “a lot of politicians fear the insiders in this industry.”The credits have long been criticized as favoring developers. State Auditor Nicole Galloway, a Democrat, found about $150 million in low-income state credits are redeemed a year. Long term, about $1.3 billion are outstanding and obligated to developers, meaning they will be redeemed in future years.The credits help developers offset the cost of building housing for the working poor and older residents. Defenders of relaunching the program say it helps transform neighborhoods at a reasonable cost and creates construction jobs.The legislation is Senate Bill 28.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Galloway offers needed lessons on how government should work,"Jan 28, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/mailbag/galloway-offers-needed-lessons-on-how-government-should-work/article_6020e071-4477-5679-9839-523f5ca902b4.html,"Regarding Missouri Auditor Nicole Galloway’s column “Don’t mess with the voice of Missourians” (Jan. 25):Galloway’s column should be mandatory reading for every high school social studies class on how government is supposed to work.

The U.S. is a republican form of government. A republican government is one in which the power is held by the people, who then elect representatives to represent them and serve their interests.Gov. Mike Parson is currently trying to legislatively override the Clean Missouri ballot measure approved by voters on Nov. 6 to prevent gerrymandered political districting in Missouri.

Also on Nov. 6, St. Louis County voters passed a charter amendment to restrict political campaign contributions to $2,600 per individual. Our newly elected county prosecutor, Wesley Bell, has accepted contributions for $3,500 and $10,000 because he wasn’t sure if the law was in effect. And he’s an educated lawyer.Perhaps Galloway could offer a mandatory remedial class to all elected officials on how government is supposed to work, and that when Missourians vote for change, our representatives are supposed to represent our wishes and not what they think is best for us.Bob Haberberger • Affton"
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"With Parson watching, Missouri lawmakers discuss scholarship program for adults","Jan 28, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/with-parson-watching-missouri-lawmakers-discuss-scholarship-program-for-adults/article_01450467-1c61-566a-8d3b-6ea6aa7a4026.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • A plan to launch a scholarship program for 16,000 Missouri adults seeking jobs in high-demand trades, health care and technology received positive reviews in its first test before the Legislature on Monday.Less than two weeks after Gov. Mike Parson unveiled the proposal as part of his State of the State speech, members of a House committee heard an outline of the $22 million plan.Rep. Kathy Swan, R-Cape Girardeau, who is sponsoring the measure, said it is the first scholarship program for adults age 25 or over.

“This is intended to serve those who have fallen through the cracks,” Swan said. “We do not have anything in this state that reaches this specific group.”Parson, who took over in June, has made workforce development a key plank in his first legislative session. The money is included in the $30 billion budget proposal he unveiled Jan. 16.He says the top priority for most businesses in picking a location is the quality of the workforce. Parson believes companies may be bypassing Missouri because of a shortage of trained workers.In a sign of his interest in the issue, the governor made a rare, brief appearance at the hearing to listen in on the debate.“We all agree that change is needed,” Swan told members of the committee.Parson already has taken steps to reorganize state government by moving hundreds of staffers out of the Department of Economic Development in order to sharpen the focus of the agency on job creation.Parson also wants an additional $16.3 million for training programs designed to help workers gain skills needed at particular employers.Department of Economic Development Director Rob Dixon said despite low unemployment, economic growth in Missouri has lagged compared to neighboring states.“We need to have that supply of labor,” Dixon said. “It’s been a decade since we stepped back and assessed our economic development strategy.”
“We are really far behind and we need to catch up,” said Rep. Travis Fitzwater, R-Holts Summit.Department of Higher Education Director Zora Mulligan told members of the House Workforce Development Committee that many of the people who are migrating to Missouri do not have bachelor’s degrees.“We are bringing in people who are lower-skilled,” Mulligan said.Parson wants to set aside $22 million to provide scholarships to workers older than 25 who want to go into high-demand health care, trade and technology positions.
Rep. Craig Fishel, R-Springfield, said he has trouble hiring people to work at his construction business.“This is music to my ears. I’ve lost four key employees to retirement. I have not been able to replace them,” said Fishel.The panel is expected to vote on the measure in the coming weeks, but some lawmakers say they need additional information.Rep. Jim Hansen, R-Frankford, said the Legislature will need to know whether the programs are effective.“What kind of follow-up will the General Assembly get about this program?” Hansen asked.Dixon said the agency plans to post performance results on its website.“We have to be careful and cautious,” added Rep. Doug Beck, D-Affton.The legislation is House Bill 225.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri's disability services rise to be among nation's best,"Jan 28, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/lifestyles/health-med-fit/missouri-s-disability-services-rise-to-be-among-nation-s/article_31ac2eb0-5c5c-5d59-b58d-0f5f36d783c4.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • The Show-Me state’s intellectual and developmental disabilities services have improved from one of the worst in the country to No. 4 overall — all within barely more than a decade.These findings are compiled in the latest Case for Inclusion report, generated by the ANCOR Foundation and United Cerebral Palsy. The nationwide survey evaluates the effectiveness of each state’s disability services based on how well they reach those in need, promote productivity and independence, keep families together and measure quality of life.The 2019 study, using mostly 2016 data, highlights Missouri’s short waiting lists and transition away from housing those with disabilities in large state-run institutions. Instead, the state now serves 97 percent of disabled residents through community-based programs.

Plus, based on a national survey, those participating in state programs say they are maintaining a positive quality of life. A statewide questionnaire asked about 400 individuals in community-based environments questions about relationships, daily tasks and negative feelings, according to Missouri’s National Cores Indicator coordinator Caitlin Bartley.When the Case for Inclusion study was first published in 2006, Missouri was ranked No. 41 nationally. At the time, nine large state-run institutions housed over 1,000 people, while nearly 500 individuals and families sat on a waiting list for residential services.Valerie Huhn, Missouri Department of Mental Health’s Director of Developmental Disabilities, attributes much of the state’s progress since then to the Partnership for Hope waiver. The program, launched in 2010, allows individuals and families with disabilities to use the waiver for needs amounting to about $12,000 or less.Huhn says the original thought was that people would use the program as a first step before proceeding to more expensive services like the Comprehensive Waiver, which costs $80,000 per person.Instead, people have used the short-term waiver for immediate needs such as transportation and personal assistance services, then returned a few years later when they needed more help. By addressing these “easy issues” upfront, the department is better able to prevent them from turning into “big expensive crisis issues in the future,” according to Huhn.“That helped us eliminate our wait list which now allows us to serve people before they’re in a crisis situation and that’s a really big deal,” Huhn said.Partnership for Hope also proved to be economically savvy according to a comprehensive evaluation of the program published by the University of Missouri-Kansas City’s Institute for Human Development in 2017.“The unique structure of PfH allows the state and counties to split the state Medicaid match amount, providing the state more funding for services than traditionally funded Medicaid programs, where specifically, for each $1 spent by the state and counties, Missourians with DD received about $5.34 worth of supports and services,” the study found.The program has served more than 4,000 people, according to the 2017 findings.Missouri’s disability service advances can also be traced to its transition from state institutions toward community-based residential programs. About 64 percent of the people accounted for in the original Case for Inclusion report have left Missouri’s larger facilities.While the survey commended the state for closing three of its institutions, the report pushes to eliminate them altogether, as 14 other states and the District of Columbia have done.“Nationally, (eliminating institutions) is clearly the goal, but we still find value in them,” Huhn said.Huhn said the state sometimes leans on the facilities as temporary housing for those experiencing “crisis placements where someone will be left in a hospital, left in a jail.“So then occasionally we will utilize the institutions for those individuals but the goal the entire time they’re there is to get them back out in a community placement,” Huhn said.
The Department of Mental Health’s growing budget has helped expand disability services as well. Over the past eight years, the funding for the Division of Developmental Disabilities alone has increased from around $600 million to over $1.1 billion.Gov. Mike Parson’s recently released budget recommendations included an additional $100 million in general revenue for the department.A need for jobsDespite its strides toward improved disability services, Missouri is still struggling with some of the same issues that are recognized nationally. For the Show-Me state, it comes down to jobs — jobs for those with disabilities and jobs for those assisting them, also known as direct support professionals.Brianna Washington, a St. Louis resident, has been attending classes and volunteering at Paraquad, an independent living center for residents with disabilities, for years. This past year, she decided she wanted to start being paid for her work.
Washington applied to the state’s job program for those with disabilities through Paraquad and landed a gig at Bloom Cafe. While in the training phase of the program, Washington has started with short shifts on Friday afternoons, working her way up to expanding her hours.

Though Washington has enjoyed the program, many other Missourians with disabilities have not participated in the state’s employment programs. The Case for Inclusion study found only 10 percent of residents with intellectual and developmental disabilities are competitively employed, or working alongside those without disabilities — amounting to about half the national average.The Missouri Department of Mental Health is aiming to enroll 35 percent of individuals between 16 and 64 in employment services, “which is a stretch,” Huhn admits.Since the department launched its Empowering through Employment program in October 2016, the number of those enrolled jumped to 960 from 367 as of December. Still, Huhn says that makes up only about 7.5 percent of the targeted population.“We’re far from where we need to be, but that’s okay,” Huhn said. “We continue to work on it. We talk about it every month because getting people employed is the best thing we can do for individuals with disabilities.”Missouri’s low employment of residents with intellectual and developmental disabilities stems in part from another shortage.The latest Case for Inclusion report labeled the nationwide direct support professional deficit as “A Workforce in Crisis.” DSPs help individuals with disabilities with day to day tasks like driving and getting dressed.In Missouri these hands-on employees make an average of $10.56 an hour, according to a 2015 NCI report. The same data showed a 49.1 percent turnover rate in Missouri, with 8 percent of jobs remaining vacant from time to time.Nearly 90 percent of former DSPs said they left their jobs because of inadequate wages, according to a survey included in the Case for Inclusion report.ANCOR and ANCOR Foundation CEO Barbara Merrill said the crisis could have damaging effects on disability services across the country.“Without the professional staff needed to provide the supports and services that enable people with I/DD to be integrated into the community, provider agencies have little hope of maintaining and expanding on any progress they’ve seen in the past decade,” Merrill said in a press release."
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Editorial: Timothy Prosser and the case for clemency,"Jan 27, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-timothy-prosser-and-the-case-for-clemency/article_fbcd73b0-a0df-5592-ab2c-60f3793e7605.html,"Timothy Prosser is rare among prisoners. The prosecutor in his drug-trafficking case — that is, the man responsible for locking him up for life — sent a compelling letter to Gov. Mike Parson last month arguing for Prosser’s release.“I do not make this request lightly,” Carl Kinsky, former prosecuting attorney in Ste. Genevieve County, wrote. “It is the result of considerable soul-searching.”A strange set of circumstances led to Prosser’s exceptionally harsh sentence. In 2004, a jury found Prosser guilty of four drug charges, all stemming from the same incident. He did not have any prior felonies, but he had a long-term drug addiction that began in a familiar way with a pain medication prescribed for an injury.

Eventually, Prosser ended up cooking methamphetamine in his trailer, primarily to feed his addiction. Because of the amount of supplies in his possession when he was arrested, he was sentenced as if he had intended to manufacture and distribute that same large amount of finished product. That is implausible. The final amount would have yielded far less than the raw materials. He was sentenced at a time when lawmakers were desperate to curb an escalating meth crisis in Missouri. Prosser denies having sold meth.For prosecutor Kinsky, the most troubling aspect of the sentence stems from his own action during the sentencing. The jury asked if a life sentence would still allow Prosser to be eligible for parole. But Kinsky argued against informing jurors that Prosser would not be eligible, and the judge agreed.
This has haunted Kinsky. In his plea to the governor, Kinsky writes that he now “finds it unconscionable that a defendant in a murder trial has the benefit of a jury being so informed, but not Timothy Prosser.” In fact, a juror in this very case signed an affidavit later saying that jurors did not intend to impose such a harsh sentence but were denied jury instructions about the sentence.
Prosser, a first-time, nonviolent drug offender, has already served 15 years in prison for his crime. He is the only person in Missouri serving a life sentence without parole for drug trafficking. He has been a model prisoner and completed various substance-abuse programs.Nonviolent crimes caused by a drug addiction do not deserve a life sentence with no chance of parole. Even rapists and murderers have served far less time.“I know it is unusual for a prosecutor to ask for leniency for a person he has prosecuted, but this is an unusual case, and I hope you will have the moral courage to give it your consideration,” Kinsky wrote in his letter.We join Kinsky’s brave call. Have the courage, Gov. Parson, to right this wrong. Grant Timothy Prosser clemency."
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Editorial: Outlining the case for clemency,"Jan 27, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-outlining-the-case-for-clemency/article_16182efc-86e7-5fb2-bfe8-97a9cbb00e09.html,"In Missouri, governors find mercy as they’re heading out the door. Republican Gov. Eric Greitens pardoned five people and commuted the sentences of four before he resigned. Democrat Jay Nixon granted 110 clemency actions — the most by a Missouri governor in three decades — and the vast majority came late in his second term.Gov. Mike Parson has an opportunity to restore clemency power as it was meant to be exercised to remedy the worst injustices.For the past several decades, those who suffered miscarriages of justice hung their hopes on an unlikely last chance based on a governor’s whims and political calculations. The prevailing social attitude was to lock offenders up and throw away the key, and sentencing reflected this mindset.

But that mindset is changing as the public becomes acquainted with the significant and obvious flaws in the criminal justice system. Harsh sentences handed down decades ago to drug abusers, for example, would no longer be given today. Such sentences fail to serve the cause of justice, and lawmakers have been taking action at state and national levels to fix what’s wrong in sentencing guidelines.There is rare bipartisan agreement that the current system of mass incarceration is morally reprehensible and financially untenable for taxpayers. While reforming such a vast system typically entails slow-moving legislative relief, Parson has an opportunity to right some of the worst wrongs without delay.Some cases involve offenders serving life sentences for victimless crimes. There are women who suffered extreme abuse and received disproportionate sentences at a time when there was no recognition or understanding of battered-spouse syndrome. There is one drug case, described in the accompanying editorial, in which even the prosecutor says the defendant was railroaded and deserves release.
This occasional series will highlight these most egregious situations and urge the governor to take corrective action.Clemency wasn’t always a hard sell. In the 1970s and early 1980s, Republican Gov. Christopher Bond and Democratic Gov. Joseph Teasdale each approved around 200 clemencies. It could be employed more easily as a constitutional check on prosecutorial and police overreach. Conservative Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist described clemency as the “fail safe” in America’s criminal justice system.
It would send a powerful message for Parson, a former county sheriff, to reaffirm the paramount value of mercy in dispensing justice. Most offenders convicted of serious crimes deserve the punishment they receive. But that doesn’t mean all convicts should be blindly stripped of their humanity or labeled unredeemable until their full sentences are served.If there are legitimate and compelling reasons to commute a sentence and restore a person’s freedom, there is no reason to wait years to act on it.Gov. Parson, let justice serve as a hallmark of your tenure, not a postscript."
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,St. Louis County Democrat eyeing 2020 governor's race,"Jan 26, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/st-louis-county-democrat-eyeing-governor-s-race/article_d36c5dd3-e3a3-519c-8b35-e4a6df0af3a6.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • State Sen. Scott Sifton said Friday that he was preparing to run for Missouri governor in 2020 — a move that could set up a contest next year between the St. Louis County Democrat and Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican.“I’m focused on the legislative session that just began, but it’s my present intention to run,” Sifton told the Post-Dispatch, adding that he was planning to officially enter the race at a later date.

Scott Sifton (D) 






Sifton’s announcement comes as Auditor Nicole Galloway, the only Democrat elected to statewide office in Missouri, signaled Thursday that she did not intend to run for the post next year. When asked if she had no desire to run, Galloway said in an interview: “Yeah, I’m here focused (on) being auditor.”Sifton, 44, is term-limited in the Senate and flirted with a run for attorney general in 2016. He is thought by party insiders to be the only major Democrat eyeing the party’s nomination.Sifton is a practicing attorney, formerly of the Husch Blackwell law firm. He lives in the Affton area with his son Stephen, 10, and daughter Madelyn, 6. He won a seat in the Missouri House in 2010. His Senate district stretches from the Oakville area north to Brentwood. The seat had been held by a Republican until Sifton flipped the district in 2012.“Right now let’s just call him a potential gubernatorial candidate,” Senate Minority Leader Gina Walsh, D-Bellefontaine Neighbors, said on Friday. “Scott’s a thoughtful person, and he doesn’t rush into anything when he makes decisions. He analyzes, and that’s what I like about him.”In the past, Missouri Democratic Party leaders have coalesced around a preferred nominee for governor early on in each election cycle. The party has not had a competitive gubernatorial primary in 15 years.Galloway has championed legislation Sifton has sponsored. In March 2018, and again this year, Galloway voiced support for legislation that would force major state contractors to disclose contributions of $500 or more to dark-money 501(c)(4) groups.Sifton also advertised the endorsement of the Missouri Fraternal Order of Police during his 2016 re-election.














        
            State Senate seat rooted in South County a key for both major parties

Democratic incumbent Scott Sifton of Affton faces Republican Randy Jotte of Webster Groves in the St. Louis area's most competitive Missouri Senate race.




Then- Gov. Jay Nixon, the state’s last Democratic governor, from 2009 to 2017, often struggled to satisfy various factions of the state Democratic Party.He sought to appeal to broad cross-sections of the state by honing an “independent” brand, seen as too conservative by many Democrats.During protests in Ferguson, some black politicians and others grew angry at the governor’s handling of the situation. Then- Attorney General Chris Koster, a Democrat who ran for governor in 2016, also faced criticism that he was too conservative.
Walsh said Sifton had not shied away from favoring things such as access to abortion and gay rights.“I think it’s fair to say I’m socially progressive,” Sifton said Friday.Sifton suggested he favored a more fiscally conservative approach to government spending.“We’ve got to be careful with how we spend our public dollars in Missouri,” he said. “The more efficient we are, the more we can do to help folks, whether that’s Medicaid, education or anything else.”
Sifton has been able to pull off close victories in the St. Louis County suburbs, suggesting he has the ability to appeal to independent voters. He said his campaign would focus on “wages for working families and access to affordable health care and quality education.”As of New Year’s Eve, Sifton had just under $318,000 cash on hand after raising more than $70,000 in the last fundraising quarter and spending $57,000, according to recent campaign filings. He was not on the ballot last year.By comparison, Parson, his likely Republican opponent, had $936,000 on hand at the end of the year. The Uniting Missouri PAC, which does not have to adhere to campaign contribution limits and is supporting Parson, had $2 million in its coffers.No similar group has raised significant money for Sifton.His most recent campaign filings show expenditures on campaign consulting, website support and office rent. He has also paid four staffers in recent months.Many outstate Missouri counties appear to be tilting increasingly further to the right, and the state’s suburbs may prove crucial to Democrats seeking to regain power in 2020.Encouraged by a better-than-expected Democratic showing in the 2nd Congressional District, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is already sending out emails blasting U.S. Rep. Ann Wagner, R-Ballwin, whose district covers much of the St. Louis suburbs.Wagner narrowly hung onto her seat last November, but also outspent her opponent, first-time candidate Cort VanOstran, a Democrat.Several other Republicans in the state House faced challenges in the Kansas City and St. Louis suburbs last election, though Democrats ultimately flipped just three Republican seats. Republicans were able to neutralize the Democrats’ gains by winning three Democratic seats in conservative areas.Lexi Churchill of the Post-Dispatch contributed to this report.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Governor’s proposed grant program would help strengthen workforce,"Jan 25, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/mailbag/governor-s-proposed-grant-program-would-help-strengthen-workforce/article_c8da723d-5618-5673-9b8c-133d59c4cac3.html,"In coverage about Gov. Mike Parson’s budget plan (""Bridge repair tops Parson’s list,"" Jan. 17), I was delighted to see his budget includes a proposed $22 million grant program to help fund college tuition for approximately 16,000 adults annually.It’s my understanding that grants would be available to Missourians over 25 who fit the income eligibility and plan on getting degrees in high-need skill areas like nursing and IT. Funds could cover up to four college semesters for each student.

This grant program is welcome news for educators and businesses, as well as for the 755,000 Missourians who have some college experience but no bachelor’s degree. As the demand for an educated workforce grows and the number of available jobs in these high-skilled areas continues to increase, it’s vital we do everything possible to increase the number of college-educated Missourians.
For five years, I’ve served as chancellor of local, nonprofit, fully online university WGU Missouri. Since the university was created in 2013, we’ve made great strides in increasing the number of degreed individuals by offering a flexible, competency-based structure that allows students to leverage on-the-job experience to earn their degrees faster. Funding support from our state could only help us and other universities succeed in growing the number of college graduates by ensuring tuition is both accessible and affordable, especially for those who need it most. Supporting adult learners and helping them secure degrees that enable them to better support their own families will be essential in closing the workforce gaps needed for Missouri to prosper in the years to come.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,St. Louis County mayors back alternative plan for potential city-county reorganization,"Jan 25, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/st-louis-county-mayors-back-alternative-plan-for-potential-city/article_52665b7d-f35e-57db-b1d2-fa2c3cc709f4.html,"CHESTERFIELD • Local mayors and elected officials made official Thursday night their effort to stop any forced consolidation of municipal governments in St. Louis County by a statewide vote and to keep any decisions about the shape of government in local residents’ hands.The voice vote came without dissent at a meeting of the Municipal League of Metro St. Louis at Chesterfield City Hall.“I’m elated, with our board and our membership,” said Norm McCourt, league president and mayor of Black Jack, after the meeting. “It sends a crystal clear message: Ignore us at your peril.”

The overwhelming vote favors creating a special board authorized by the Missouri Constitution to come up with any plan for a reorganization of the county and city of St. Louis. The board could decide on a plan to merge the county and the city of St. Louis without consolidating municipalities, or propose no changes at all.The league will seek 20,000 voter signatures to force St. Louis Mayor Lyda Krewson and St. Louis County Executive Steve Stenger to appoint the so-called Board of Freeholders.














        
            Trying to bridge the city-county divide, 137 years and counting

In the Great Divorce, St. Louis City became its own county. That happened compliments of a fraudulent election in 1876 and a vigorous court ch…




The plan is an effort to keep the fate of the region with local voters. It’s an alternative to a plan — for which Stenger and Krewson have publicly expressed support — by a St. Louis nonprofit group to hold a statewide vote to merge the county and city. That plan would combine under one megacity the police departments, court systems, roadways and economic development arms of the city, county and all 88 county municipalities.The nonprofit, Better Together, says the proposal would require a constitutional amendment to create the new form of government. The nonprofit plans to announce Monday a campaign to gather more than 160,000 signatures to put its proposal before voters statewide in November 2020.The effort is largely funded by billionaire financier Rex Sinquefield. Area business leaders have said they favor a consolidated government.But mayors and elected officials in St. Louis County have balked at Better Together’s plan. They say it maneuvers around local voters to give outsiders control over the shape of government in the St. Louis area.“I can’t imagine being a member of St. Louis County and voting on matters” in other counties, Chuck Caverly, councilman in Maryland Heights and a league board member, said after the meeting.Caverly introduced the resolution to vote on the league’s plan. It was immediately seconded and approved.“Local government is the best government,” he said after the meeting. “Why is it the best government? Because it’s the closest to the people.”The league’s plan provides for an “open, public, transparent” process, Pat Kelly, the league’s executive director and the former mayor of Brentwood, told members before the vote.“We can all agree that there are some issues in our region, but we can also all agree, I think, that by working — I hate to use this word — together, we can collaborate and come up with some solutions,” Kelly said.Board member and Ferguson Mayor James Knowles III followed the comment by suggesting the league use the word “collectively,” instead of “together.”Kelly and McCourt also disputed Better Together’s claim that a statewide vote would be required to form a new consolidated government.
McCourt said the league requested the chance to participate in the studies Better Together did to draft their plan but was refused.“This league was denied the opportunity to participate then, and it’s still denied the opportunity now,” he said.McCourt also invited Sinquefield to meet with the board.“It is past time for Mr. Sinquefield to come out of the shadows to discuss his plans and goals for the organizations he sponsors,” he said.Eighty-one municipalities and both the city and county of St. Louis are voting members of the league. It was not clear exactly how many were present Thursday night.
If the league gathers enough signatures for its effort, Stenger and Krewson would have 10 days to name nine members each to the 19-members of the Board of Freeholders. Gov. Mike Parson would appoint the final board member.Once appointed, the board would have to hold its first meeting within 30 days, Kelly said.“This isn’t a process that anyone can ignore,” Kelly said.The effort will need 3 percent of those who voted in each jurisdiction in the latest gubernatorial election, which would be 15,000 signatures in the county and 5,000 signatures in the city, Kelly said.The board would then have a year to formulate any plan, which would then require approval from county and city voters, Kelly said.It was unclear how exactly the effort to gather signatures would move forward, but board members say they plan to ask elected officials to coordinate unpaid volunteers and to take advantage of municipal elections in April to talk to voters.Knowles said he expects the signature gathering to be easy.McCourt said he will stand outside Black Jack City Hall to solicit signatures.A Board of Freeholders last convened in 1987, but opponents sued, and the board’s plan never made it to voters.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,St. Charles County was not included in state bridge plan. Its two senators withhold their support.,"Jan 24, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/st-charles-county-was-not-included-in-state-bridge-plan/article_8ceabfdb-0973-57e9-b7cc-6b01a97ee667.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • St. Charles County’s two state senators want to see spending in their area before supporting Gov. Mike Parson’s proposed $350 million bond to repair and replace hundreds of bridges in Missouri.“In my own district, there are no projects whatsoever,” Sen. Bob Onder, R-Lake Saint Louis, told reporters on Thursday.Sen. Bill Eigel, R-Weldon Spring, said he met with Parson, also a Republican, on Wednesday. Eigel said he didn’t push for any specific projects in his district to be included in the list of more than 200 bridges to be repaired over a four-year span.

“I don’t want to get too far in the weeds for a discussion that really has just gotten underway,” Eigel said, “but the governor has recognized the need for projects to be done around the state — not just in urban areas, not just in rural areas — but around the state. Identifying what that list is — we’re just now getting on to that part of the discussion.”When asked whether the list of projects was open for negotiation, Parson’s spokesman, Steele Shippy, said in a statement: “The Governor is working every day with members of the legislature to discuss his plan that clearly prioritizes the entire state of Missouri, not any one district or project.“The Governor’s infrastructure plan is built on bold ideas and a willingness to tackle tough issues — like fixing 250 bridges in need of critical repair or replacement,” Shippy said.Projects in the St. Louis region represent 8 percent of the total being spent throughout the state during the multiyear initiative.In making his pitch for the bridge plan, Parson said the list of projects was not politically driven because they were chosen by regional planning boards and then approved by the state Highways and Transportation Commission.That sentiment was shared by Senate President Dave Schatz, R-Sullivan.“We try to take politics out of it. They are on the five-year plan because it’s time to address those,” Schatz said. “I’m not sure there is a lot of negotiations.“If someone is concerned they are not getting enough attention, they just may be blessed that they have good bridges,” Schatz said.In the first year of the program, MoDOT would oversee three bridge replacement projects in the St. Louis area worth a total of $8.3 million.They include the $1.2 million replacement of a bridge on Ladue Road over Hibler Creek in Creve Coeur; a $2.7 million replacement of a bridge over Happy Sac Creek in Franklin County; and a $4.4 million replacement project at the intersection of Valley Dell Drive and Gravois Road in Jefferson County.
By comparison, the list calls for 18 projects worth $31.2 million in the more rural northwest part of the state.The Kansas City region will receive $25.5 million in funding for 14 projects in the initiative’s first year.The state will direct $14.5 million to 13 projects in northeast Missouri next fiscal year.“I understand that in St. Louis, maybe you have a couple of areas where there’s a bottleneck, so that is a concern,” said Sen. Cindy O’Laughlin, R-Shelbina, in northeast Missouri. “But in our area, we have roads that are falling apart, and you’re in danger of driving off the road and overturning.“We all realize that there’s various competing interests, and that we have to find a way to address that,” O’Laughlin said.
In Year 2, the list calls for $13.3 million in St. Louis area projects, including replacing the North Broadway bridge over Interstate 44 in St. Louis. That compares to six projects that year in the Kansas City region worth $21.5 million.There are no projects in the St. Louis region in the third year of the plan and just three worth $5.9 million in the fourth and final year, including the replacement of the Missouri Highway 47 bridge over Interstate 44 in St. Clair in Franklin County.MoDOT officials said the infusion of cash would free up funds for other road projects around the state. Voters in November rejected a 10-cent increase to the state’s fuel tax that would have jump started construction projects.Some Democrats agree that the projects should be the subject of political horsetrading.“That’s the business we signed up for. That is literally what we do,” said Sen. Jason Holsman, D-Kansas City. “You will see some changes to that list if it is going to successfully navigate both chambers.”Eigel and Onder said they agreed with Missouri voters that taxes should not be raised to pay for the upgrades, and did not doubt the concept of issuing bonds to fund bridge repairs, especially because bridges are long-term assets.Eigel, Onder and O’Laughlin made the comments during a press conference organized to launch the Senate Conservative Caucus, a six-member subset of Senate Republicans.They said they would act as a resource for Senate conservatives. Members said the caucus was not formed to challenge the authority of Senate Republican leaders.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,St. Louis County mayors plan to propose their own city-county reorganization,"Jan 24, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/st-louis-county-mayors-plan-to-propose-their-own-city/article_9893c4b1-5361-5c16-a0f3-3eab4f360ee6.html,"ST. LOUIS COUNTY • Area mayors and elected officials have formed a plan to thwart the forced consolidation of municipal governments and keep the fate of the region in the hands of local residents.The board of directors of the Municipal League of Metro St. Louis expects to ask its members on Thursday night to support an alternative proposal, one that could merge the city of St. Louis and St. Louis County but avoid municipal consolidations — or even do nothing at all.“We don’t have any predetermined outcomes,” said Municipal League Executive Director Pat Kelly.

The plan, if approved, would direct the Municipal League and its partners to gather about 20,000 voter signatures and force St. Louis Mayor Lyda Krewson and St. Louis County Executive Steve Stenger to appoint a special board, called a Board of Freeholders, authorized by the Missouri Constitution to plan for a city and county reorganization.Ultimately, Kelly said, the Freeholders could meet for 12 months and make no recommendation.














        
            St. Louis city and county: Divorced in 1876. Remarried in 2020?

A nonprofit group has an audacious plan to stitch the city and county back together through a statewide vote. 




Municipal League members said the point, here, was to keep power with local voters.“I believe this is a regional issue,” said Webster Groves Mayor Gerry Welch, who sits on the Municipal League board. “If you get good people together to deal with our regional problems, we could figure this out. It should absolutely not go to a statewide vote.”Concern over voters elsewhere in Missouri deciding the shape of government in St. Louis stems from an effort by a St. Louis nonprofit called Better Together, funded largely by billionaire financier Rex Sinquefield. On Monday, a Better Together task force plans to announce an initiative to gather more than 160,000 signatures and place on the November 2020 statewide ballot a measure to merge St. Louis and St. Louis County. The proposal aims to combine under one megacity the police departments, court systems, roadways and economic development arms of the city, county and all 88 county municipalities.The Better Together proposal would require a constitutional amendment to create a new kind of government both for existing municipalities and for a combined city and county, said Blitz, Bardgett, & Deutsch attorney Chris Pieper, who has been working with the task force on its plan.A Board of Freeholders, he said, doesn’t amend the state constitution and can’t do what Better Together wants to get done.Krewson and Stenger have publicly announced their support for the Better Together plan. And several business leaders recently have spoken in favor of such a change.

But the idea of Missouri voters deciding St. Louis’ fate has otherwise infuriated elected officials, many of whom were suspicious of the group’s work from the beginning.The St. Louis County Council voted unanimously more than a year ago to oppose a statewide vote on such a proposal. Mayors across Missouri denounced what they saw as a run around local voters. And members of the state Legislature panned the idea this week, with two even filing legislation against it.
Municipal League leaders said Wednesday that it was time for them to act.“We felt it was important to have this discussion transparently, to have it locally, and for the St. Louis region to be in charge of its own destiny,” said Ferguson Mayor and Municipal League board member James Knowles III.If the league’s proposal passes, leaders will work with others in the community to gather signatures to compel Krewson and Stenger to appoint 18 of the 19-member special board. Gov. Mike Parson would appoint the final member. The effort would need 3 percent of those who voted in each jurisdiction in the last gubernatorial election.The special board would have the power to come up with any plan it sees fit to bring to the voters of St. Louis city and county. The last time a Board of Freeholders convened was in 1987. But opponents sued, and the effort never made it to voters.Several Municipal League members predicted that the proposal would pass on Thursday.
“If you’d asked me this a couple months ago, the whole concept would have been a little bit foreign,” Chesterfield Mayor Bob Nation said.But on Wednesday he called it “much preferable.”Normandy Mayor Patrick Green expected a packed house at the meeting.“Is there another way?” he asked. “People are not numbers and economics. We’re not saying we don’t want to improve.”And he said he was pretty sure he would vote with the group in favor.Municipal League meetingWHEN • 6:30 p.m. Thursday WHERE • Chesterfield City Hall, 690 Chesterfield Village Parkway

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Surprise tax bills: Missouri lawmakers frustrated as impact of state withholding error sinks in,"Jan 24, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/surprise-tax-bills-missouri-lawmakers-frustrated-as-impact-of-state/article_9d1a32ee-f08f-5a6e-8489-5ca7e213ee1e.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Thousands of Missourians expecting a state tax refund this spring could instead receive surprise tax bills because of a tax withholding error — a blunder that drew sharp criticism from members of the House Budget Committee Wednesday.Because of errors in withholding tables drawn up by the Department of Revenue that were corrected in September, taxpayers expecting to receive modest refunds could instead owe the state money. And even those who do receive a refund could have it reduced by as much as 90 percent, the department has said.Making matters worse, the state is depending on those people who will owe money to send in their checks so that revenues match the amount of money the state is seeking to spend this fiscal year.

Lawmakers expressed frustration that issues with state-formulated withholding tables were not widely publicized, which could have mitigated surprise bills.“It’s a lack of communication,” said Rep. Kip Kendrick of Columbia, the ranking Democrat on the budget panel. “I’m going to have very upset constituents — everybody in this room will have very upset constituents — and somehow we’re all crossing our fingers right now hoping they’ll owe us money. That’s terrifying.”As of Wednesday, income tax revenue was down $532 million, or 13 percent, this fiscal year compared with the same point last fiscal year. Department of Revenue Director Joel Walters on Wednesday blamed sluggish figures on the withholding error.Walters said he still expected general revenue collections to grow as tax season intensified. Walters said he still believed the state’s estimate of 1.7 percent general revenue growth over last fiscal year was accurate.“I am confident of that,” he told lawmakers.Next year’s estimate forecasts a 2 percent growth in net general revenue over this year. Gov. Mike Parson’s recommendations for the state’s $30 billion budget are based on that assumption.“I think that number’s appropriate,” House Speaker Elijah Haahr, R-Springfield, said of the predicted revenue growth.Tax refund problems this year are due in part to the December 2017 federal tax overhaul, championed by Republican lawmakers and President Donald Trump.Congress doubled the standard deduction and eliminated the personal exemption. Missouri bases its income taxes on the federal system and allows a personal exemption only if one is available for federal filers.In the past, taxpayers who minimized the number of dependents generally didn’t owe the state money when they filed. The changes in state withholding tables means those people should change their strategy on this year’s return.
“Now you should claim those dependents to not owe money,” state Treasurer Scott Fitzpatrick has said. “For people who didn’t change their elections after the tax changes occurred, having no dependents creates a liability.”Another problem: Walters said the state did not notice until the federal tax changes a 15-year-old defect in its withholding formula that went unnoticed until the federal tax law exacerbated the impact of the error.“None of this impacts the actual amount of tax anybody owes,” Walters said, explaining that even if an employer did not withhold an adequate amount, the amount of taxes owed did not change.Rep. David Wood, R-Versailles, asked whether anyone should be disciplined over the error.“I have no fear of giving consequences to people,” Walters said. “This is a situation where when I look through it, you know, if I see that there’s somebody that deserves consequences, I will do it. I haven’t seen that at this point.”
The surprise tax bills have drawn special scrutiny from Democrats, who are also concerned about the effects on revenue from two tax laws state Republicans have approved in recent years.House Minority Leader Crystal Quade, D-Springfield, has proposed a bill that would extend the deadline for Missourians to pay their 2018 income tax bill.On Wednesday, Quade asked Walters about how widespread the filing issues will be, something the department has been hesitant to estimate.“I would like to know the amount of families, or people, that are going to be affected by this so that we can start to get word out to our constituents,” Quade said before the Wednesday budget hearing.The spotty collections come as lawmakers begin to parse Parson’s budget request for next fiscal year, which starts July 1. Parson, a Republican, spent time Wednesday meeting with individual members of the House and Senate, including legislative leaders and new members on both sides of the aisle.In the short meetings on Tuesday and Wednesday, Parson outlined his plans for boosting workforce development and upgrading infrastructure.“He also spent time answering questions and listening to the concerns of local communities, as well as listening to the priorities of individual members,” said spokesman Steele Shippy.Kurt Erickson of the Post-Dispatch and the Associated Press contributed to this report.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri House minority leaders want more for K-12 funding,"Jan 22, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/education/missouri-house-minority-leaders-want-more-for-k--funding/article_af6ceb0d-350b-508f-a245-b603f65ff74e.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • When it comes to K-12 funding, House Minority Leader Crystal Quade, D-Springfield, says doing the minimum is not enough.During a press conference Tuesday, House Democrats asserted that Missouri’s current K-12 funding standards are not sufficient. The state has fully funded the formula since 2017, only after making it easier to do so the year before. About $6.1 billion, or 22 percent, of the state’s budget went to K-12 funding in the 2019 fiscal year.Still, Rep. Kip Kendrick, D-Columbia, says there are significant disparities across the state when it comes to school resources.

“Richer, wealthier communities are able to put forward more local support and are able to help their teachers, pay their teachers more and more adequately fund education, but where I grew up in Northeast Missouri, rural Missouri, the tax base is less,” he said.Kendrick said that if the state did not address these inequalities, the gap in resources would only widen. He pointed to the increasing number of counties altering their schooling structure as a result of the funding issue.“We need to have a real conversation about what is forcing school districts into a four-day school week,” Kendrick said. “I think that if we were to adequately fund the foundation formula as well as the school transportation formula, I suspect that many of those school districts would choose to reverse that decision.”During the State of the State address last week, Gov. Mike Parson made it clear that workforce development was at the top of his agenda. The next day he issued several executive orders that restructure four state agencies in attempt to achieve his goal. This included moving the Division of Workforce Development under the Department of Higher Education.
On Tuesday Quade poked that education is not just about workforce development. While she’s happy to have conversations about those efforts, Quade is concerned they may take away from adequately funding the basics like K-12.
“It's like when your car is broken down on the side of the road and somebody comes by with an ice cream cone,” Quade said. “You’re happy about that ice cream cone, that’s great, but your car’s still broken. And I think that when we’re discussing these issues we need to be looking at the broken car as well.”

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri needs long-term investment to fix its infrastructure,"Jan 22, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/columnists/missouri-needs-long-term-investment-to-fix-its-infrastructure/article_d9c47114-f603-55ac-87d5-612436d8a8a2.html,"In response to Gov. Mike Parson’s State of the State address last week, the Kansas City and St. Louis sections of the American Society of Civil Engineers are glad to see infrastructure mentioned as a top priority for our state. We were happy to hear that Gov. Parson highlighted investing in critical infrastructure as one of the priorities to be addressed this legislative session, and one of the major issues he’s looking to tackle as a means of moving Missouri forward.As indicated in the 2018 Report Card for Missouri’s Infrastructure, our roads and bridges need improvement, so it was relieving to hear the governor propose a repair program for 250 bridges. Unfortunately, we have almost 3,200 bridges in the state of Missouri that are structurally deficient, and over $4 billion is needed for repairs and modernization. While not unsafe, structurally deficient bridges require significant maintenance, rehabilitation or replacement of load-carrying elements. In order to remain in service, structurally deficient bridges are often posted with weight limits, which can be an inconvenience as posting can increase commute times for our emergency vehicles and school buses.Many of our roads are also in poor condition, which costs each motorist $604 per year in vehicle operating costs. It was just last year that ASCE released infrastructure grades for Missouri, and our cumulative grade was a C-minus.

In his speech, the governor called for using $350 million in freed-up state and federal resources to repair the estimated 250 smaller bridges across the state. The governor’s proposed infrastructure plan would accelerate MoDOT’s list of larger infrastructure projects. These are steps in the right direction.While Gov. Parson’s plan is promising, he also stated that we need to find creative ways to invest in our infrastructure without a tax increase. Our state’s fuel tax has been frozen at 17 cents per gallon — one of the lowest in the country — since 1996. Imagine trying to live off of your 1996 salary. It wouldn’t go very far. Increasing project construction costs and inflation have reduced the purchasing power of Missouri’s state fuel tax from 17 cents to 8 cents per gallon. With fuel tax being the state’s major source of transportation funding, Missouri’s ability to fund future transportation maintenance and capital projects is in jeopardy.In St. Louis, the city is working hard to position the Gateway to the West as a critical national freight hub. St. Louis has America’s third-largest inland port, four interstates with national access, five airports with capacity and six class I railroads. To capture a share of the 40 percent increase in national freight volume expected over the next 30 years, state legislators must focus on infrastructure improvements that can help ensure our freight network can accommodate future growth.
The St. Louis Regional Freightway has identified critical multimodal projects and is working with its regional partners to accomplish their goals. Those public partners must be ready to contribute their share of funding to improve our public road system. Our freight network is only as strong as its weakest link, and our economy depends on this freight network.Missouri needs an all-hands-on-deck approach that will involve state, local and the federal government. Proposition D, which was rejected last November, would have addressed some of our surface transportation infrastructure challenges. However, the proposition was poorly worded and confusing. It did not clearly state that the funds would be used to fund new roads and bridges. Nevertheless, we cannot let that vote deter us from identifying critical funding for our state’s roads, bridges and transit systems.
In looking to our neighbors, Iowa, Nebraska, Oklahoma and Tennessee have all raised their fuel taxes and Kentucky set a floor, meaning that the impact of a decrease in wholesale gasoline prices on the state’s 9 percent excise tax on motor fuel will be limited. These states are starting to see the benefits of their legislative actions.Let’s put Missouri on equal footing with our neighbors and ensure we remain competitive for businesses and provide a good quality of life for residents. Let’s move forward by enacting funding solutions that provide long-term, sustainable investment to modernize our roads. We need to act now.Sheryl Gallagher is chair of the Report Card for Missouri’s Infrastructure."
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,What is Parson doing about plague of gun violence?,"Jan 22, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/mailbag/what-is-parson-doing-about-plague-of-gun-violence/article_a856c487-885d-5db9-8573-7171ce5f173f.html,"Some time ago at the introduction of his director of public safety, Gov. Mike Parson said:""Probably one of the first things I’ll ask her to do is to be building those relationships to see what those issues are, and see if there’s ways that we can help. I’ve been pretty open all along that I’m a very strong supporter of the Second Amendment, but I also realize at times if there’s ways we can do things better, then I’ll look at that.”

The plain-speaking governor has yet to come back about that statement, not in his State of the State address, and not in response to my phone calls. Just what did he mean? With the plague of gun violence in our major cities and surrounding counties, this concern easily ranks alongside bridges as a top priority.
Does ""there's ways we can do things better"" mean that he would consider some form of gun control or regulation in conjunction with the Second Amendment and Missouri's own ""inalienable right"" firearms amendment? Does he recognize that in Missouri there are two fundamentally different gun cultures, rural and urban, yet the rural conservative agenda seems bent on turning our state into an armed camp primed for street justice and class warfare?
One would expect Gov. Parson, a former county sheriff, to be forthcoming about guns and crime.Terry Beckmeyer  •  New Haven"
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Messenger: When it comes to Sunshine Law, Missouri is the Show-Me State no more","Jan 20, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/columns/tony-messenger/messenger-when-it-comes-to-sunshine-law-missouri-is-the/article_a0ab9e74-4f57-5dd7-bafd-ac2c819a9bfa.html,"Roll over in your grave, Willard Duncan Vandiver.Missouri is the Show-Me state no more.Vandiver is the former U.S. Congressman who in a speech in 1899 declared:

“I come from a state that raises corn and cotton and cockleburs and Democrats, and frothy eloquence neither convinces nor satisfies me. I am from Missouri. You have got to show me.”The speech is widely credited as being the origin of the saying that has long been Missouri’s unofficial slogan. The implication is that it takes more than fancy words from politicians to cajole Missourians. We want to see evidence. We want public accountability.For some elected officials, that’s no longer true.On Tuesday, the Missouri House, controlled by a veto-proof Republican majority, voted to establish a new rule that would allow elected representatives to keep their records shielded from prying eyes. This follows a November vote in the state in which 62 percent of Missourians enshrined into the state’s constitution a new provision that applies the Sunshine Law to state lawmakers. In effect, House Republicans raised their collective middle fingers and pointed them at voters.“You want us to Show You our work?” they said. “No thank you.”The move came on the same day that a different branch of government in Missouri stood up for the Sunshine Law, which allows citizens to hold elected officials accountable by making their work a matter of public record. The Court of Appeals, Western District, upheld a previous decision by Cole County Circuit Court Judge Patricia Joyce to fine former Cole County Prosecuting Attorney Mark Richardson for multiple violations of the Sunshine Law. That case will end up costing taxpayers $36,000 in fines and attorneys’ fees.Richardson, who lost his re-election bid in a GOP primary last August, had been found to have “knowingly and purposefully” violated the Sunshine Law in refusing to hand over public documents sought by attorney Aaron Malin. Malin, along with David Roland of the Freedom Center of Missouri, have filed numerous similar lawsuits across the state alleging multiple violations of the Sunshine Law. They have won against prosecutors, sheriff’s departments and police departments.In Missouri, these days, far too many public officials believe the people’s records are made to be hidden, not shared.
Just a week or so before the House decided to ignore state law and the constitution, the Department of Health and Senior Services decided, for instance, that Missourians had no right to know which individuals or businesses will be operating the nascent medical marijuana industry in Missouri. The department denied Sunshine Law requests filed by me and another Post-Dispatch reporter to see the “pre-application forms” of those people or companies who have plopped down thousands of dollars to get in line to operate what could end up being multi-million-dollar businesses, with licenses handed out by state regulators. The office of Gov. Mike Parson said it supports the decision by DHSS officials to keep taxpayers in the dark.The Post-Dispatch has protested the decision. But it is part of a growing body of evidence that in Missouri, when residents ask their public officials to “show-me” the records, the answer is all-too-often a resounding no.Even when the answer is yes, it often comes with a caveat.
Later this year, a Sunshine Law case against the University of Missouri is scheduled to go to trial. In that case, an animal rights group sought records related to the testing of animals, and the university’s response was to ask for $80,000.Last year, when I wanted to see the records behind a commendation St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar gave to the officers who police MetroLink, the department wanted $5,000. There are dozens of similar examples across the state.Because the Missouri Sunshine Law sets a high bar for lawyers to win back their fees in such cases, public officials know that more often than not, the strategy of charging an exorbitant amount of money to search for records has a chilling effect on the process of obtaining them.That leaves the public in the dark, which is what the Missouri House voted to do this week.It’s a travesty, says lawyer Mark Pedroli of Clayton. He’s still embroiled in a Sunshine Law case of his own, seeking records (and a deposition) from former Gov. Eric Greitens about the governor’s use of the text-destroying app Confide. That lawsuit has uncovered widespread use of the app in the Greitens administration, which during its short reign became infamous for its disregard for public accountability laws.“Missouri elected representatives are not high priests entitled to privileged communications with constituents,” Pedroli tweeted after the House’s action. “They don’t want you to see their emails/texts with their donors, maybe even dark money donors demanding favors.”Welcome to Missouri, the State of Redaction.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,'The ultimate hero': Civilian from St. Louis among dead in Syrian suicide bombing,"Jan 20, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/world/the-ultimate-hero-civilian-from-st-louis-among-dead-in/article_3dc5d556-1db8-581b-b74c-30f671184e49.html,"Scott Andrew Wirtz’s family thought he was invincible. As a youth, he was fearless. As a brother and a son, his personality filled the room. And as a SEAL, he didn’t talk about serving his country. He just did it.“He was the ultimate hero,” said Matt Shadow, one of Wirtz’s many cousins and extended family members in the St. Louis area.A decorated Navy SEAL and operations support specialist with the Defense Intelligence Agency, Wirtz was “the person that always wanted to serve his country and was doing all of these great things,” said Shadow, 38, of St. Louis. “Anyone who serves in the service especially at that level, you have to have that state of mind of ‘I’m going all in for what I love, my passion,’ and that was him.”

Wirtz, 42, of St. Louis, was identified Friday by the Department of Defense as one of four Americans killed in a suicide bombing by the Islamic State in Syria.He was a civilian assigned to the Defense Intelligence Agency as an operations support specialist, guiding on-the-ground intelligence gathering as a part of the Islamic State-targeted Operation Inherent Resolve.Wirtz served eight years in the Navy and as a Navy SEAL, leaving the service as a petty officer second class in 2005, and getting a job with the Defense Intelligence Agency in February 2017, according to the agency.He had completed three deployments for the agency in the Middle East, and won multiple awards and decorations for his service, including the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal, Good Conduct Medal, National Defense Service Medal, Rifle Marksmanship Ribbon, Pistol Expert Medal, and, with the intelligence agency, the Secretary of Defense Medal for the Global War on Terrorism.A St. Louis native, Wirtz attended All Souls School in Overland and graduated from De Smet Jesuit High School in St. Louis in 1995, said Lisa Wirtz-Hampton, his aunt.She remembers her nephew was fearless. As a youngster, he built a 6-foot skateboard ramp that he used for tricks and, out of high school, he took a job hanging acoustic tile that required him to be suspended upside down, she said in a text message.Shadow and Wirtz grew up together for a time in Bridgeton, where they became as close as brothers, Shadow said. The two are members of a large, close-knit family. Wirtz’s laugh was often “the best, the loudest and fullest” in the room at gatherings, Shadow said.“He was very fun loving,” he said.After graduating from De Smet, where was as a running back on the football team, Wirtz went straight into the Navy, Shadow said. Their grandfather served in the Navy in World War II.Wirtz didn’t talk about his desire serve his country, he just did it, Shadow said.“He was always the type of person who wanted to serve his country,” Shadow said. “He had that mindset from the get-go, ‘This is what I want to do and so this is what I’m doing.’”When Wirtz visited home, he did not talk much about his military service, Shadow said. He was focused on spending time with family and friends.“He was always more about other people than he was about himself,” Shadow said. “People who don’t know Navy SEALS, they don’t necessarily think of someone who is full of laughter and love, but he was the kindest, most loving person.
“He would do anything for anybody, especially for his family and his brothers that he served with. He was a true warrior with the heart of a teddy bear.”In his free time, Wirtz pursued a number of adrenaline-pumping hobbies, including training with top mixed martial arts fighters, motorcycle riding and underwater spear fishing. He traveled to every continent and lived several years in Thailand, Wirtz-Hampton said.“He loved the adrenaline rush whether driving in his Jeep or motorcycle riding. ... He told me once that the most beautiful place on earth was Bali, Indonesia,” said Wirtz-Hampton, whose brother is Wirtz’s father.“Our families’ hearts are broken. His mom and dad lost their only child. My brother lost not only a son but to me, his best friend.”
Wirtz was not married.Funeral services had not yet been arranged, Shadow said. Wirtz’s father and stepmother, of Lake Saint Louis, and mother had left the St. Louis area for Delaware to receive their son’s remains.Missouri Gov. Mike Parson said he was notified of Wirtz’s death by the Pentagon early Friday.“Scott died bravely serving our nation in a dangerous part of the world and for that we are grateful,” Parson said. “I want to thank his family for his service and we also ask all Missourians to join in prayer for the family and other brave men and women that are serving our country.”The defense department also identified two other Americans who died in the attack, Army Special Forces soldier Jonathan R. Farmer, 37, of Boynton Beach, Fla., and Navy Chief Cryptologic Technician Shannon M. Kent, 35, of upstate New York.All three died on Wednesday after a suicide bomber detonated an improvised explosive device in Mabij, Syria. The fourth American was not identified.The attack, which killed at least 16, was the deadliest assault on U.S. troops in Syria since American forces entered the country in 2015.The defense department said the incident is under investigation, but provided no other information.Kurt Erickson of the Post-Dispatch contributed to this report.Editor's note: Wirtz attended All Souls School in Overland. An earlier version of this story was incorrect.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Editorial: Another test of lawmakers' will to clean up Jefferson City,"Jan 19, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-another-test-of-lawmakers-will-to-clean-up-jefferson/article_e67c4b79-a51f-557a-83f8-17c3f1383e4e.html,"In case Missouri lawmakers missed the unmistakable walkaway message from the Nov. 6 election, we will restate it clearly for them: Missouri voters want cleaner, more transparent government. They want to put an end to the domination of Jefferson City by special interest groups. They want legislators to be elected based on the power of their ideas, not the microscopic gerrymandering of districts to predetermine their partisan makeup.Hoping to capitalize on overwhelming voter support for the “Clean Missouri” amendment on Nov. 6, state Sen. Scott Sifton, D-Affton, proposes to go one step further by lifting the veil that currently prevents Missourians from knowing the extent to which big donations influence the awarding of major state contracts. The donations Sifton is specifically targeting in his Transparency in Government Contracting Act (Senate Bill 148) are those that go to “dark money” political organizations.Although dark money has had pernicious effects on state and national politics for years, most Missouri voters were probably oblivious to it until Gov. Eric Greitens’ 16-month term in office ended in scandal last year. Millions of dollars in donations from invisible sources poured into Greitens-controlled dark money organizations. The extent of those donations’ influence on his advocacy as governor might never be known because investigations into potential influence-peddling fizzled with his resignation in June 2018.

But that doesn’t mean dark money and pay-to-play governance are gone from Jefferson City. Without legislation to uncloak the legally protected secret-donor web, there’s little to stop lawmakers and state executives from continuing down the corrupt trail Greitens blazed.
“Taxpayers don’t know whether government business is being affected by the corrupting influence of secret, dark money,” Auditor Nicole Galloway said in a statement endorsing Sifton’s bill. “This bill would bring transparency to the contract process by making sure Missourians know when taxpayer dollars are being used in state contracts that go to dark money contributors.”Sifton’s bill would require individuals or entities engaged in contracts worth $5,000 or more to report the political contributions they make to 501(c )(4) dark money organizations. All donations of $500 or more would be covered under his measure, and reporting requirements are retroactive to the 12 months preceding the awarding of the contract. The general public would have access to those reports.
Big donors accustomed to the quid pro quo of donations in exchange for special legislative favors no doubt will hate this bill and expend no small effort to kill it. They reportedly panicked when investigations into Greitens’ fundraising practices threatened to reveal donor identities.If the GOP-dominated Senate and House truly wanted to honor the voters’ call for cleaner, more transparent governance, they’d embrace this bill and quickly send it to Gov. Mike Parson’s desk. But given Clean Missouri’s tepid reception so far in Jefferson City, we won’t be holding our breath."
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Historic tax credit bottleneck stalling redevelopment projects, delaying reimbursement","Jan 19, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/business/local/historic-tax-credit-bottleneck-stalling-redevelopment-projects-delaying-reimbursement/article_5a1ac2a4-84f1-5afc-9a80-b1d1de171819.html,"Jassen Johnson, the developer behind a host of historic rehabs in the area around midtown, submitted an application for Missouri historic tax credits to help finance one of his projects last January. He submitted another project in March and another in June.He’s still waiting to hear if the projects will qualify. So are his lenders.“They have yet to start reviewing applications for the 2018 year,” he said he’s heard. “Four of our projects are on hold waiting for the backlog to get caught up a little bit.”

A bottleneck of what some suspect is over 200 applications for state historic tax credits has stretched what had typically been up to a 90-day review process to one that is taking over a year in some cases, creating uncertainty for a development community that has come to rely on the credits to finance many projects.“It’s a train wreck,” said Deb Sheals, a historic preservation consultant in Columbia, Mo. “You can’t wait a year. I’ve got clients who are trying to do good things for their hometowns by investing in their downtown, and it’s taken a year to get an answer.”Missouri has long had one of the largest state historic tax credit programs in the country, ranking well above any other state in the number of projects and the amount of money invested in projects that utilized the credits, according to the National Trust for Historic Preservation.














        
            Historic tax credits in Missouri would be pared back under bill okayed by Missouri Senate

Supporters say the state should use the savings for other programs.




St. Louis developers, with a vast stock of turn-of-the-20th-century buildings to choose from, have especially benefited from the credits. Between 2002 and 2016, the $3.16 billion invested in local projects that used the credits was the most in the country, according to the National Trust, ranking above even far larger old cities such as New York and Philadelphia.As a result, developers and the banks that lend to them have come to rely on the credits, which reimburse up to 25 percent of qualified project expenses after it’s complete. And there’s still plenty of empty old buildings in town that need rehabbing.Though Missouri legislators last year lowered the cap on how many historic credits can be issued a year to $90 million from $140 million, that change isn’t causing the hold-up.Rather than the Department of Economic Development, which actually issues the tax credits, the slowdown is in the State Historic Preservation Office that reviews applications to ensure designs comport with historic preservation standards. It first reviews a project on the front end — often allowing developers to borrow money based on a promise of credits at a project’s completion — and on the back end, to ensure the developer maintained the historic elements of a building as promised.“I am aware of it,” Missouri Department of Natural Resources Director Carol Comer, whose department includes the preservation office, said Thursday. “We’re addressing the problem.”Due to staff turnover, the state historic preservation office was down to just one professional reviewer in recent months. It has since hired another and an administrative staffer in an effort to get the office back up to full strength, which developers and historic preservation advocates say is usually three to four project reviewers plus some administrative support staff.“Hopefully we’ll have another reviewer on board in the next few weeks,” said Mike Sutherland, deputy division director for the Missouri parks department, which oversees the office. “We’ve been working pretty hard to get back to fully staffed, and we’re just about to that point.”In the meantime, the backup is having an effect.The $67.8 million “Delmar Divine” plan, announced in 2017, to turn the empty St. Luke’s Hospital on Delmar Boulevard into affordable apartments for social services professionals is waiting for its application to be processed so it can finalize its financing package.“The one thing we are still waiting on is our tax credit approval,” Craig Heller, representing the development team made up of former Build-A-Bear Workshop CEO Maxine Clark and Clayco development affiliate CRG, told a St. Louis board last month during a hearing on the project’s request for property tax abatement.The review delays are also on the back end of the process, after projects are complete and awaiting the issuance of tax credits.
Citing the delay in obtaining state historic tax credits, a development group that includes Lutheran Messiah Church and its nonprofit consultant Rise Community Development this month sought a six month loan extension from a city development agency that issued bonds to finance the rehab of 12 properties in the Fox Park and Tower Grove East neighborhoods.‘Undue burden’The project, which is complete, is still paying around $22,000 in interest a month on its construction loan while it waits for the state historic tax credits to be issued. That’s the last piece its lenders and investors are waiting on before signing off on a permanent loan, which would cost around a tenth of the interest the developers are paying now, said Mark Stroker, Director of Real Estate Development at Rise.“It creates an undue burden in terms of what it costs to put these things together,” he said. Rise and its partners are working to “beg, plead and cajole our investors to fund that installment without the benefit of actually having the credits, and that’s a leap for them.”Lawrence Group CEO Steve Smith said he just submitted his final application to receive reimbursement on the recently completed Angad Arts Hotel, a $65 million rehab of the former Missouri Theatre office building in Grand Center.“I’ve already been in communication with my lenders to say, we’re really not sure how long it’s going to take,” Smith said.
Some of the issue was the state’s practice of hiring architects to become historic preservation reviewers. In a good economy and in a state government known for paying its workers less than other states, finding someone with that professional degree was difficult.Sutherland, at the state parks division, said his office recently did some research and found that it was only a long-standing practice — not a requirement — that plan reviewers be architects. Most other states with historic tax credit programs don’t require that, and he said they were able to draw more interest in the positions from historic preservation professionals by removing the architecture degree requirement.While those in the industry agree the staff turnover and lack of hiring was an issue, they also suspect former Gov. Eric Greitens, a vocal critic of the state’s tax credit programs, sought to slow the review process and added to the backup.“I think they didn’t want to see the program work,” Sheals, the Columbia consultant said. If they slowed the administrative review, they hoped, “people would just give up and go away.”One internal policy change Greitens added was a final administrative sign-off above the plan reviewer by a deputy administrator. Sutherland, hired in mid-2017 by the Greitens administration, said he does sign off on the historic reviews but the added time is “not significant” and he relies on the opinions of the experts in the office. Asked whether there had been an administrative slowdown of application processing under the last administration, Sutherland said: “our role is to carry out the policy that the policymakers have made” and he’s currently doing all he can to resolve the backlog.The office has authorized overtime and even some seasonal work by retired employees with expertise in the program’s requirements, Sutherland said. One of them should start soon.The industry is hopeful that Gov. Mike Parson’s administration, which is close to proposing new rules for historic tax credit reviews as required by last year’s legislation lowering the cap, is more open to the program. Missouri Preservation Executive Director Bill Hart, whose organization advocates for the program, said he has spoken with Parson’s staff about the backlog and issues at the historic preservation office.“I see a light at the end of the tunnel,” Hart said. “I think the current administration has done a lot of things to help stabilize” the program.Even so, it could take some time to get back to normal. And on top of everything, the federal government shutdown means National Park Service employees who also participate in the historic review are now off the job.“The wheels of government turn very slow,” Sheals said. “But we’re in a huge hole here.”Jack Suntrup of the Post-Dispatch contributed to this report.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Editorial: Short takes on blindfold challenges and blinder bigotry,"Jan 18, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-short-takes-on-blindfold-challenges-and-blinder-bigotry/article_ffca3eb9-7f3c-534b-b4fa-76f480267498.html,"The Darwin challengeIn the Netflix film “Bird Box,” a mysterious force overtakes Earth, causing masses of people to do suicidal things. The only protection is to wear a blindfold for all outdoor activities — canoeing, driving, shooting guns — because the force enters people’s brains through their visual cortex.So, of course, there’s a new fad called the Bird Box Challenge, in which people around the country are attempting incredibly dangerous things, like driving or giving each other tattoos while blindfolded. It’s almost as if their brains have been seized by a mysterious force that makes them do suicidal things.

The results have been as disastrous as you might expect, including a Utah teenager who crashed her car into another vehicle while driving blindfolded. Netflix felt compelled to issue a plea to all viewers to be careful (translation: Stop being stupid).And that also goes for anyone thinking of a twerking challenge, too. Do not ride atop a car going down an interstate highway (as happened in St. Louis this week) while twerking. Just don't.Good morning, Nashville!President Donald Trump tweeted that he was really excited about his address to farmers during his Monday trip to Nashville. “Love our farmers, love Tennessee — a great combination!” he tweeted. Just one problem: His scheduled speech to the American Farm Bureau’s annual convention that day was in New Orleans.The presidential gaffe couldn’t have come at a worse time for that particular sector of the electorate. Trump is trying to shore up flagging support among farmers after his shutdown sharply curtailed U.S. Department of Agriculture services and forced suspension of payments to farmers under a $12 billion bailout package he arranged after provoking a trade war with China.Previous administrations maintained strict policies requiring multiple layers of review before presidential communications were released to the general public. Under Trump, no one but the president is to blame for his communication screw-ups — or his shutdown.So long, GeorgeA Hawaiian land snail named George died recently at age 14, apparently taking his whole species with him. George was of the species Achatinella apexfulva, which once covered the Hawaiian island of Oahu. He lived in Kailua, Hawaii, in a terrarium. He is believed to have been the last of his kind.Scientists who publicized George’s plight hope it will wake people up to the real-world impact of climate change.Many types of once-plentiful land snails and other species have gone extinct on the Hawaiian islands in recent years, with the effects of climate change among the culprits. For George’s relatives (the ones who didn’t have benefit of an aquarium), the drying of the Hawaiian ecosystem proved too much to handle.
“He’s been a constant for a really long time,” David R. Sischo, who directs the state-run Snail Extinction Prevention Program, told The New York Times. “If anything good comes out of this extinction, it will be the recognition that we have a lot to lose, and we don’t have a lot of time.”The King of bigotryRep. Steve King, the Iowa Republican, has long shown himself to be arguably the most irredeemable bigot in Congress. But a recent interview, in which he expressed genuine befuddlement about what was so wrong with being a “white supremacist,” was too much even for the previous enablers in his party.House Republicans this week stripped King of his committee assignments. Some top GOP leaders have suggested he should resign. In case he doesn’t, efforts are underway to recruit a 2020 primary challenger.This burst of Republican wokeness is welcome — though it’s worth asking what took them so long. This is the same Rep. King who for years has cozied up to Nazi sympathizers and who enthusiastically promoted the racist “birther” movement. He once tweeted, “We can’t restore our civilization with somebody else’s babies.” The list goes on. King's tenure in Congress should not.
What about concealed dogs?New Missouri House rules prohibiting lawmakers from bringing their dogs to work make sense, even though a lot of politicians could use the examples of sincerity and loyalty that dogs provide.The new rule is especially ironic given that, even as officials are barring man’s best friend from the Capitol, they’re considering letting visitors bring in concealed guns.The gun proposal, by Gov. Mike Parson’s administration, has whipped up some strong public opposition that, hopefully, will get him to back off on this plan. Some opponents have said, reasonably, that they won’t let their kids go on field trips to the Capitol if they allow guns in.Staying putMissouri Gov. Mike Parson was right to reject a request to transfer state workers out of a downtown St. Louis office out of concern over crime. Crime is a concern downtown, but the solution — especially for a state government — isn’t to run from it. That would’ve sent a terrible message.As the Post-Dispatch’s Kurt Erickson reported, the Missouri Department of Revenue sought to move seven employees out of the Wainwright State Office Building downtown to an office in Clayton. The reason, said the written request, is that employees are “increasingly concerned about their safety while walking to the parking garage and the MetroLink station.”Parson’s office has effectively said to the employees, “Stay put,” which is exactly right.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri wants more time to negotiate agreement on 144-mile Rock Island Trail,"Jan 18, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-wants-more-time-to-negotiate-agreement-on--mile/article_d54e92c2-849c-55d1-9b6e-1fdec40d31bc.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Missouri officials want more time to decide whether to accept the donation of a former rail line that state parks boosters want converted into a biking and hiking trail.Faced with a Feb. 21 federal decision deadline, the Missouri Department of Natural Resources and the Missouri Central Railroad, a subsidiary of Ameren, on Thursday asked the U.S. Surface Transportation Board for a six-month negotiation extension, a DNR spokeswoman said in an email.""DNR and Missouri Central Railroad intend to continue working toward the goal of signing an interim trail use agreement in the near future, if mutually agreeable terms can be reached,"" said Connie Patterson, spokeswoman for DNR.

The 144-mile former rail line, stretching from Beaufort in Franklin County to Windsor in western Missouri, would resemble the Katy Trail, another former rail line that cyclists and hikers use to traverse the state.











Then-Gov. Jay Nixon, a Democrat, announced plans to convert the rail line in 2016. He has continued to promote the project since leaving office.Patterson said Thursday the Surface Transportation Board is not operating due to the partial federal government shutdown.""However, it will continue to have jurisdiction to grant the extension even if the shutdown prevents it from doing so until after Feb. 21,"" she said, citing past board decisions as precedent.Although the state and the railroad have completed the ""complicated endeavor"" of salvaging the line, the two sides have not struck an Interim Trail Use Agreement.
That said, the two sides have made ""substantial progress"" in that regard, according to a letter the two sides sent to the federal board on Thursday.In asking for the delay, the DNR and the rail road cited the ""extreme complexity"" of converting the corridor, which stretches through 10 counties, numerous small cities and various other settlements. ""The size and complexity of the corridor adds to the significant undertaking for trail sponsorship, and it is essential that MDNR understand the immediate and long term liabilities, costs, benefits and opportunities involved,"" the letter states.
The request says that three Missouri governors have been in office since the trail was first proposed, meaning each has ""needed to be briefed"" on the project.Mike Sutherland, deputy state parks director, said in December that officials were worried about the cost of constructing and maintaining the trail, and whether that would divert finite resources from existing state parks.Project boosters, including Nixon, have urged state parks enthusiasts to contact Republican Gov. Mike Parson's administration to voice support for the project.The Missouri Farm Bureau Federation has opposed the planned trail network, saying it would disrupt nearby farms and lead to increased road and public safety expenses.Meanwhile, the state has not moved forward with development plans for four mothballed state parks acquired during Nixon's tenure.Despite the lack of development, a state parks official told the Post-Dispatch last year there were no plans to sell off the land.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"After May riots, Missouri to close maximum-security prison","Jan 18, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/after-may-riots-missouri-to-close-maximum-security-prison/article_0c8a2453-d32a-56d1-ae43-92376b46f8f1.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Eight months after hundreds of inmates rampaged through a short-staffed maximum-security prison in northwest Missouri, the facility is being shuttered as part of Gov. Mike Parson’s reshaping of state government.On Friday, the governor and Missouri Department of Corrections Director Anne Precythe said mothballing the 1,440-inmate Crossroads Correctional Center in Cameron will result in no layoffs and could provide savings to pay for long-needed raises for the state’s 11,000 prison workers.“This was all a business decision at the end of the day,” Parson told reporters during a press conference in his office, adding that no other prisons are being eyed for closure.

The decision to close Crossroads is part of Parson’s $30 billion budget proposal, which includes numerous changes to other state agencies in what he calls an attempt to streamline government.Precythe said one factor in deciding to close the prison is a drop in the number of inmates in the 21 prisons across the state. The current population of 30,196 inmates is down from a high of more than 33,000 just a few years ago.The decrease, she said, is partly because of changes to the state’s criminal code that went into effect in 2017, which have led to fewer people being sentenced to prison. The state also has launched a $5 million pilot program  aimed at keeping inmates from returning to prison after they serve their sentences. Parson has earmarked another $1 million for the program in his budget proposal.“We are very confident that we’re going to be able to sustain this new level of population,” Precythe said.The estimated $20.6 million saved from the closure will allow for additional salary increases over the 3 percent that Parson is proposing in his budget. Precythe said correctional officers would receive an additional 1 percent increase for every two years of service in an attempt to reward senior employees.The average salary for prison guards of $31,300 is among the lowest in the nation.The low pay has led to a high turnover rate and was blamed for the riot that occurred in May.
The disturbance started when 209 inmates refused to return to their housing units. They were upset that staffing shortages had left less time for recreation and other programming.In order to keep the facility operating, Corrections’ officials had resorted to busing officers from other prisons.After six hours of unrest, in which dining halls, the kitchen and storage areas sustained an estimated $1.3 million in damage, the prison was brought back under control.Precythe emphasized that Crossroads workers have been offered jobs within the system, which has an estimated 800 openings.
As for the inmates, most will be transferred to the adjacent Western Missouri facility after part of it is upgraded to handle maximum-security inmates. Adding a new security fence around the perimeter will cost at least $3 million.Cameron’s mayor and city manager could not be reached for comment, but Precythe said her staff has received positive reaction from community leaders about the changes.The two state senators who represent the region praised the proposal.“Nobody has to lose their job,” said Sen. Denny Hoskins, R-Warrensburg.“We’ve had a somewhat chronic understaffing problem going on there. Quite obviously it’s a safety concern and a security concern,” added Sen. Dan Hegeman, R-Cosby.While closing a prison is a rarity in Missouri, Illinois has shuttered three in the past six years, including the all women's facility in Dwight, a super maximum-security lock-up in Tamms and a youth prison in Murphysboro.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Editorial: Parson's infrastructure focus is correct, but debt-funding it is a mistake","Jan 17, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-parson-s-infrastructure-focus-is-correct-but-debt-funding/article_b1e163be-3738-5a0f-891c-a1be52600d87.html,"Missouri Gov. Mike Parson will get no argument from us in his call, reiterated Wednesday in his first State of the State speech, for the Legislature to approve funding for workforce development and infrastructure upgrades. Our big problem is with the funding mechanism he proposes, which will send the state deeper into debt.Yes, state voters rejected a ballot item on Nov. 6 that would have raised fuel taxes to pay for highway improvements. But the item was so badly worded it created unnecessary confusion and presented a wedge for its opponents to defeat it. Parson needs to champion a new ballot question that presents the issue clearly.Missouri’s need for an infrastructure overhaul is beyond debate. Some 10 percent of its bridges are rated in poor condition; its road system is aging and inadequate; its unmet transportation needs have been estimated at more than $800 million a year. The state’s 17-cent-per-gallon fuel tax, the main source of road funding, is one of the nation’s lowest. It hasn’t been increased in more than 20 years.

Last year’s Proposition D sought to address that with a good idea wrapped in a terrible presentation. It would have raised the fuel tax by 10 cents a gallon over four years. The measure had strong bipartisan support, including Parson’s backing, but it was hobbled by a complex funding plan that would have funneled some of the money through the State Highway Patrol.It was a bureaucratic workaround that still ended up with most of that money going to roads and bridges — but it didn’t look that way in the ballot language and its supporters failed to adequately explain it. The measure was soundly defeated at the polls, despite indications the public favors the concept of a fuel-tax hike for infrastructure.
It was disappointing that Parson didn’t use Wednesday’s address to make a strong appeal for another go at a fuel-tax ballot measure this year. Instead, he proposes sending the state deeper into debt by borrowing $351 million to pay for improvements.
That would leave the state with less money to cover his other priority goal: workforce development. He wants to fully fund K-12 education, which is great, but the real workforce development opportunities are in higher education, which gets no additional funding. Why? Because there isn’t enough money for it. Why? Because the state needs money for other priorities, including debt service.The Legislature should have raised the fuel tax long ago rather than shirking its duty and forcing a ballot measure, but that car has exited the highway. The voters’ decision, however tainted it was by an incompetent ballot campaign, cannot in good conscience be overturned now by lawmakers.But there’s nothing to stop Parson and other leaders from making the case for another go at the ballot. Raising Missouri’s woefully inadequate fuel tax is still the right way to address our crumbling infrastructure. Sending the state further into debt isn’t."
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Parson shuffles Missouri's economic development efforts, sends scores of workers to other offices","Jan 17, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/parson-shuffles-missouri-s-economic-development-efforts-sends-scores-of/article_3e241e45-1a07-5f76-a530-d2a128ba93a7.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Gov. Mike Parson on Thursday announced that he would move hundreds of state employees from the Department of Economic Development to other agencies across state government.The reorganization, Parson said, will ""streamline"" the Department of Economic Development, or DED, so that it can focus solely on economic development programs, moving extraneous agencies out from under its umbrella.The size of the office will plummet, from 863 employees currently to 178 after the changes take effect at the end of August, Parson's office said.

Approximately 597 DED employees affected will be divided among the Department of Higher Education, the Department of Natural Resources and the Department of Insurance, Financial Institutions and Professional Registration. Fifteen other employees will work from the lieutenant governor's office, while 73 vacant positions will be eliminated, Parson's office said.The move came the morning after Parson, a Republican, delivered his first State of the State address, during which he said he would focus on workforce development and infrastructure investments this legislative session.In announcing the reorganization, Parson's office cited a study conducted over the summer that concluded the DED had more functions compared to similar state agencies across the country.States that devoted more of their economic development resources to ""directly engaging with businesses ... tended to outperform Missouri in terms of job creation and capital investment,"" his office said.""I told you yesterday we were going to take bold steps,"" Parson said. ""I meant that as much more than just a speech I made yesterday.""Parson signed three executive orders to trigger the shuffling of state government:• One executive order, and perhaps the most consequential, is Parson's move to shift the Division of Workforce Development and the Missouri Economic Research and Information Center from DED to the Department of Higher Education.The Department of Higher Education would grow by approximately 344 employees, according to Parson's office.Commissioner of Higher Education Zora Mulligan said the Department of Economic Development's mission had become too diluted, whereas the Department of Higher Education had been limited to promoting traditional degree programs.
""In a 21st century economy, we know that we also have to be helping individuals run through apprenticeship programs, get a short-term credential, and so that broadening of perspective is a really, really useful tool for the state of Missouri,"" Mulligan told reporters.A cornerstone to Parson's workforce development strategy is the proposed creation of a $22 million program called Fast Track to get people into new, high-demand jobs more quickly.Adults over the age of 25, with a household income of less than $80,000, could qualify for 100 percent tuition reimbursement to learn new skills in job fields such as nursing.
• The Division of Energy will be moved from the Department of Economic Development to the Department of Natural Resources. The division promotes energy efficiency and renewable energy use to ""drive economic growth, provide for a healthier environment, and achieve greater energy security for future generations,"" according to its website.The move will result in approximately 37 employees moving to the Department of Natural Resources, which oversees things like environmental inspections and state parks.• The Public Service Commission and the Office of Public Counsel will move to the Department of Insurance, Financial Institutions and Professional Registration.He is renaming the Department of Insurance, Financial Institutions and Professional Registration the Department of Commerce and Insurance.Approximately 216 employees will be affected by the move, Parson said.Ryan Silvey, commissioner of the Public Service Commission, which regulates utilities, said the move will not affect the commission because it operates independently of other state departments.""The administration made it clear that they were wanting to refocus DED,"" Silvey said.He said moving the Public Service Commission and Office of Public Counsel under the umbrella the Department of Insurance, Financial Institutions and Professional Registration was a ""better fit"" because all three offices have ""consumer affairs-driven"" missions.The orders will take effect on Aug. 28, unless the Legislature intervenes, but leaders in the GOP-controlled House and Senate signaled their support on Thursday. Parson said the cost of the moves would be ""absorbed"" by the agencies.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Bridge repair tops Missouri governor's budget plan, along with money for schools","Jan 17, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/bridge-repair-tops-missouri-governor-s-budget-plan-along-with/article_f3715752-a516-5c0b-afdf-1b7f2429397e.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • In his first State of the State address, Gov. Mike Parson proposed on Wednesday raises for state workers, a new bonding scheme to fix scores of bridges, $61 million in new money for K-12 education and no change in funding for higher education.The nearly $30 billion budget for fiscal year 2020, which starts July 1, assumes a 2 percent increase in revenue next budget year.Parson, a Republican who became governor on June 1 after the resignation of scandal-plagued Eric Greitens, focused primarily on workforce development and infrastructure spending.

“I stand before you today to share a vision — a vision that will chart Missouri’s future into the next decade,” Parson told lawmakers. “Missouri is dear to my heart, and by working together, we can protect and build a Missouri that is successful for the next generation.”“When we try to make everything a priority, the fact is nothing is truly a priority,” Parson said. “So let me be crystal clear: Cultivating and training our workforce for high-demand jobs and investing in critical infrastructure are the priorities we must address this session.”Despite state revenue collections recently being described as “horrible,” Parson budget planners have not announced plans to withhold any funds during the current budget year. The state expects to collect $193 million more next year than in the current fiscal year, according to the annual consensus revenue estimate.Parson plans to set aside nearly $117 million for “future budget emergencies,” something the state has not done for several years, officials said.The proposed spending plan calls for no new taxes and no additional revenue from collecting online sales taxes or expanding gambling. The governor largely relies on a reduction in health care spending for the poor to help finance his new programs.In all, the state’s Medicaid-funded managed care programs saw an estimated $50 million drop after 100,000 people left the rolls, said budget chief Dan Haug, who attributed the decrease to an improving economy.Parson’s budget also includes cutting 430 government positions through attrition.Republican leaders in the House and Senate sounded a positive note about the proposal but warned that the Legislature would still have to sign off on the plan.“That’s something we’re just going to have to see the details of and really dig down into that,” House Speaker Elijah Haahr, R-Springfield, said.“We’re going to have plenty to talk about,” Senate President Pro Tem Dave Schatz, R-Sullivan, said.Democrats expressed concern that previous GOP tax cuts approved last year and in 2014 would eventually force the state to cut important programs.“I don’t want to sound the alarm bells, but it’s probably time to start doing it,” said Rep. Kip Kendrick, D-Columbia, who is the ranking minority member on the House Budget Committee.Among the biggest changes in the $30 billion spending blueprint will come at the Missouri Department of Corrections, which has been plagued by high staff turnover and low pay.“As governor, I am not interested in building more prisons,” Parson said to a bipartisan standing ovation.After a riot in September at the maximum-security Crossroads Correctional Facility in Cameron, Parson will close the prison and move the inmates to the nearby Western Missouri Correctional Facility.The move will save $15 million and reduce the number of correctional officers needed across the state. Parson said the consolidation would require no layoffs.The proposal has support from Democratic lawmakers who have complained about conditions at Crossroads for years. “I think consolidation is a good thing,” Rep. Brandon Ellington, D-Kansas City, said.
The prison budget also calls for an additional $1 million for the second year of a pilot program designed to reduce recidivism. Last year, despite a study saying the state needed to spend $189 million or face the prospect of building new prisons, the program was launched with $5 million in three counties.Parson also called for $30 million for a 3 percent cost-of-living salary adjustment for state workers. The raise would take effect on Jan. 1, 2020.He also wants an additional $61.4 million for K-12 education, fully funding the state’s foundation formula for education spending. Parson is proposing to keep core funding for state colleges and universities constant, as opposed to Greitens, who proposed last year slashing $68 million in higher education funding.Parson also proposed directing an additional $10 million to school transportation reimbursement costs. The issue has come into focus because the state has for years weaned school districts off of state transportation funding, prompting school districts to defer maintenance on their buses and devote more local funds to transportation.The spending plan also attempts to address a $1.5 billion backlog of maintenance projects at the state’s colleges and universities. But the $20 million set aside to help repair crumbling infrastructure will probably mean the state’s four-year institutions will see only about $2 million.The governor also announced a $22 million program to get people into new, high-demand jobs more quickly.
Adults over the age of 25, with a household income of less than $80,000, could qualify for 100 percent tuition reimbursement to learn new skills in job fields such as nursing.“This will open the doors for Missourians to have opportunities to earn more money for their hard work,” Parson said.Missouri Department of Higher Education Commissioner Zora Mulligan said the program could put as many as 16,000 students into vocational schools.After voters turned down raising the gas tax by 10 cents in November, Parson was left to propose a much smaller road and bridge repair program.The budget calls for using bond proceeds worth $351 million to repair an estimated 250 smaller bridges across the state.The afternoon address was his second speech to a joint session of the Legislature. In June, the Republican made subtle jabs at Greitens, whose meteoric rise and abrasive tactics rankled Republicans and Democrats alike.“We serve the people and the state of Missouri — not the other way around,” Parson told lawmakers at the time.Unlike Greitens, who marketed himself as a “conservative outsider,” Parson was a legislator — first in the House, then in the Senate — for more than a decade before being elected lieutenant governor in 2016.Senate Minority Leader Gina Walsh, D-Bellefontaine Neighbors, said in a speech recorded prior to Parson’s address that she hoped the problems related to Greitens’ “personal ambition and partisan politics” were “behind us” with Parson’s elevation.“But simply being better than Eric Greitens is too low a bar to set for any of our leaders, too low for the kind of change we need,” Walsh said.She said the GOP in general had backed policies that “deny too many Missourians basic health care,” policies that undermine unions and “turn our tax code upside down so that the middle class gets squeezed.”She also warned Republicans not to “weaken or repeal” policies voters enacted at the ballot box. Last year, voters backed an increase to the minimum wage, the so-called “Clean Missouri” ethics package, and access to medical marijuana. They also repealed GOP-backed “right to work” legislation.She said her colleagues should focus on education funding, increasing money devoted to school transportation, higher education job training and strengthening the state’s safety net for those with mental health issues.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Messenger: Missouri Gov. Mike Parson wants to close a prison. It's a good start.,"Jan 17, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/columns/tony-messenger/messenger-missouri-gov-mike-parson-wants-to-close-a-prison/article_ad3125c9-a2ae-5093-a147-cf1aedade99f.html,"Matt Bartle remembers the day when he came to realize Missouri needed to close a prison, maybe even two. It was March 23, 2010, and the Missouri Senate shut down to “reboot.”Facing an ongoing budget crisis that still hasn’t truly been dealt with, senators broke into eight groups to brainstorm ideas. There were no hearings that day, and very little politics.Bartle led the group talking about the criminal justice system. In a first-floor hearing room in the Missouri Capitol, Supreme Court justices including Mike Wolff and Ray Price shared ideas. There were defense attorneys and prosecutors, lobbyists and university professors. Bartle stood in front of the room with his sleeves rolled up, taking notes with a Sharpie on white sheets of paper hung on an easel.

It was both “unusual and memorable,” he says.Then a Republican state senator, Bartle now is a lawyer in private practice in the Kansas City area. A couple of months ago, I emailed him to ask him about that day.“That is how I think about that day,” Bartle said, “a big whiteboard session where all ideas were accepted and valued. We got swept up in it. One thing was clear — we were all agreed it was time to rethink criminal justice and incarceration. Both the right and the left thought so.”Among the conclusions of that day?The need to close a prison.For decades, Missouri’s corrections budget has been rising. So has its prison population, with a “tough on crime” philosophy filling prisons with nonviolent offenders with little regard for costs or results.Price, in his address to the Legislature that year, made the case even before the unique brainstorming session led by Bartle.“I could quote different statistics and relationships to you all morning, but the simple fact is, we are spending unbelievable sums of money to incarcerate nonviolent offenders, and our prison population of new offenders is going up, not down — with a recidivism rate that guarantees this cycle will continue to worsen at a faster and faster pace, eating tens of millions of dollars in the process,” Price said. “Missouri cannot afford to spend this much money without getting results.”
The effort to close a prison failed that year, and hasn’t really reared its head since.Until now.In his first State of the State address this week, Gov. Mike Parson announced his intention to close the Crossroads Corrections Center in Cameron. The move will save about $15 million. Parson is making the move to save money, but also in recognition that putting more and more Missourians in jail isn’t solving any problems.
In an ideal world, the Missouri Supreme Court will help him accomplish his goal of reducing the state’s prison population.Next month, the court will hear two related debtors prison cases, answering the question as to whether it is legal for judges to use the courts to collect “board bills,” charged for room and board. Often, mostly in rural areas of the state, judges hold defendants in contempt when they fall behind on those payments, or miss a court date, sending them back to county jail, or in some cases, state prison. Already, the Court of Appeals, and Attorney General Eric Schmitt have weighed in: Threatening poor defendants with more jail time because they cannot afford to pay is not legal, they say.Missouri’s county jails and its state prisons are full of people who are there mostly because they got caught up in a criminal justice system that all too often punishes people for being poor. In some cases, Bartle learned almost a decade ago, the problem is exacerbated by rural judges who hand out disparate sentences for nonviolent crimes.“Essentially, rural areas were dramatically overutilizing prison space and costing taxpayers accordingly,” Bartle said. “We looked at the same exact criminal acts and saw that if a person was convicted in a rural county they were substantially more likely to get prison time and longer prison time than those who committed the exact same crime in an urban area.”If lawmakers in the Missouri Legislature want to follow Parson’s lead, and build on the national bipartisan movement that is embracing criminal justice reform, they won’t stop at simply closing one prison.They’ll attack the debtors’ prison problem. They’ll better fund the public defenders system, and reduce the backlog that threatens the constitutional rights of too many indigent Missourians by erasing the possibility of jail for some nonviolent offenses. They’ll further examine the private probation system rampant in the state and reduce incentives for for-profit companies to keep poor people behind bars simply because they can’t afford ever increasing costs.County commissioners, and some sheriffs and prosecutors, will push back, just as they did in 2010. But, as Price told lawmakers nine years ago, in a speech that Parson just gave new legs: “There is a better way.”“We need to move from anger-based sentencing that ignores cost and effectiveness to evidence-based sentencing that focuses on results,” the former Missouri chief justice said. “We know how to do this. States across the nation are moving in this direction because they cannot afford such a great waste of resources. Missouri must move in this direction, too.”

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri government makeover includes moving state oversight of public radio and TV,"Jan 17, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-government-makeover-includes-moving-state-oversight-of-public-radio/article_d0223bab-ad59-54f2-9c92-929434d5903a.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Although Gov. Mike Parson didn’t broadcast it in his State of the State speech Wednesday, his budget for the coming year includes significant changes in how Missouri administers funding for public radio and television and the arts.As part of a restructuring of state government, the Republican chief executive wants to move the Missouri Arts Council, the Missouri Humanities Council and public TV and radio oversight to his former office.For now, there is no talk of using it to reduce funding for the affected divisions. But, the move would alter the tiny Lieutenant Governor’s office in a big way.

Current Lt. Gov. Mike Kehoe, whose main job is to preside over the Senate, would see his otherwise low-wattage office go from eight employees to 23 and his budget jump to $9.7 million, up from $590,000.A spokesman for the governor said Parson believes Kehoe will be ready for the added duties when they go into effect later this year.“The answer is `yes,’” Steele Shippy said Thursday, a day after Parson unveiled a $30 billion spending blueprint for the fiscal year beginning July 1.The change is part of a push by Parson to refocus the duties of the Missouri Department of Economic Development, which currently handles the programs that would be handed over to Kehoe’s office.Along with stripping DED of those duties, Parson announced Thursday his plan to move hundreds of other agency employees to other departments.The changes are receiving positive reviews from Republicans.“I’m really excited about what the governor is doing on the budget. Certainly, (there are) many initiatives I think many of us would be very supportive of,” said Sen. Dan Hegeman, R-Cosby, who chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee.
Sen. Sandy Crawford, R-Buffalo, has already introduced legislation – Senate Bill 264 - to help pave the way for the move.Democrats say the proposal needs to be reviewed.
“Let’s face it. Some of these agencies are where they are for a reason. So, we need to be prudent in what we do with them,” said Senate Minority Leader Gina Walsh, D-Bellefontaine Neighbors.Missouri has four Public Broadcasting Service stations, including the Nine Network in St. Louis, known by the call letters KETC.There are 13 National Public Radio affiliates broadcasting in Missouri.The arts council, meantime, distributes grant money to organizations across the state. This year, it doled out $4.4 million to arts groups ranging from the Opera Theater of St. Louis to the Lemp Neighborhood Arts Center.The humanities council is the state affiliate of the National Endowment for the Humanities, which is designed to help citizens of Missouri explore subjects including history, literature, languages, law, philosophy, and ethics.Department of Economic Development spokeswoman Maggie Kost said there are no major changes planned for how the divisions will operate once they move to the Lieutenant Governor’s office.“We’re going to make it as seamless as possible,” Kost said.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Messenger: Former Missouri lawmaker pines for the good old days, when he didn't have to pay for beer","Jan 16, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/columns/tony-messenger/messenger-former-missouri-lawmaker-pines-for-the-good-old-days/article_adf9f804-a0eb-53f5-ad67-9801fabb713e.html,"With a tweet in a snowstorm, former state Rep. Robert Cornejo prosecuted the Republican establishment case against Amendment 1.In November, Missouri voters of all political stripes overwhelmingly approved the anti-corruption constitutional amendment, sponsored by the bipartisan Clean Missouri coalition. It limits lobbyists gifts, sets campaign donation limits, makes state lawmakers subject to the state’s open records law, closes the revolving door between lawmaking and lobbying and reduces gerrymandering in the drawing of legislative boundaries. Amendment 1 passed with 62 percent of the vote.But some Republican establishment interests — including Gov. Mike Parson — nearly immediately announced plans to try to undo the will of the voters.

Enter Cornejo. The former state representative and attorney from St. Peters resigned his seat last year when Parson appointed him to the Labor and Industrial Relations Commission, a plum assignment that pays about $107,000.On Saturday, Cornejo lamented that Amendment 1 might get in the way of his former colleagues’ beer-drinking habits. A Boston-based craft brewer, Harpoon Brewery, had tweeted a picture of two cans of its Harpoon IPA, with a message sent to Republican and Democratic lawmakers, suggesting they get together for a beer summit to work out their differences.The brewery was taking a shot at the federal shutdown, which is limiting the ability of small craft breweries to get new cans approved for their ever-changing beer lineups.Cornejo tried to turn the tweet into a metaphor about what is wrong with Missouri’s Amendment 1, which affects state lawmakers.
This great idea is banned here in Missouri #moleg thanks to the unconstitutional sham of Clean Missouri! People of all political stripes should get together over a drink and work towards common ground. Prost! https://t.co/GjuUUcG2hT— Robert Cornejo (@CornejoForMO) January 12, 2019

“This great idea is banned here in Missouri thanks to the unconstitutional sham of Clean Missouri!” Cornejo wrote. “People of all political stripes should get together over a drink and work towards common ground.”The problem, of course, is that nothing in Cornejo’s tweet was true.In fact, the strength of the Clean Missouri proposal was that it brought together people from both sides of the aisle, including Democrats such as former U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill, and Republicans such as former U.S. Sen. John C. Danforth, and former state senators Rob Schaaf, Jim Lembke and Bob Johnson. There is nothing that stops any of those people, or any state lawmakers, from getting together for a beer to discuss their differences. The main idea of Amendment 1 is to make them use their own money to pay for that beer, rather than take money from lobbyists, as has been the norm in Jefferson City for far too long.It’s easy to understand why Cornejo might be averse to that suggestion. In each of his last two years in the House, he was the fifth-highest lobbyist gift-taker, receiving thousands of dollars in free meals, tickets to concerts, golf outings, and, yes, beer.But to be clear, Amendment 1 doesn’t even ban that which Harpoon Brewery was attempting to accomplish.That beer isn’t available in Missouri, but I found it online retailing for $16.99 a 12-pack. That would mean each can of beer theoretically sent to a lawmaker would cost $1.42. That’s still legal in Missouri under Amendment 1, which sets a “$5 per occurrence” lobbyist gift limit.
As I was responding to Cornejo on Twitter, trying unsuccessfully to get him to admit to the error of his ways, I was sipping on an Incarnation IPA made by 4 Hands Brewery here in St. Louis. The six-pack of cans I bought costs $7.99, or about $1.33 per can.Here’s another truth Cornejo chose not to respond to during our discussion:Unlike lawmakers, in his new job, he’s not allowed to take any gifts from lobbyists at all.That’s because among his first acts as governor, Parson signed an executive order banning members of his administration from taking such gifts. That executive order also includes a ban on members of the governor’s administration from taking lobbyist jobs upon leaving state government work.
So, the very governor who has announced his support for legislative efforts to overturn Amendment 1, signed an executive order containing similar elements to the anti-corruption effort approved by voters.This is the sort of common ground that the folks at Harpoon Brewery intended for lawmakers to find together, as they shared discussion over a hoppy IPA.It’s a good idea. And it’s one that should happen more often in Missouri.It still can.The voters in Cornejo’s home county understand that. Nearly 63 percent of voters in the GOP hotbed of St. Charles County approved Amendment 1.I’ll wager two cans of Cornejo’s favorite IPA that those voters won’t take too kindly to lawmakers attempting to overturn their will.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"With focus on jobs, Missouri's new governor to outline budget in State of the State speech","Jan 16, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/with-focus-on-jobs-missouri-s-new-governor-to-outline/article_27334269-01e5-59b6-acbf-57de6ac999e1.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • At this time last year, Republican Mike Parson was toiling in the political backwaters of Missouri, serving as the heir to the throne if something were to happen to the governor.Now, six months after stepping into the top spot in state government when Eric Greitens resigned amid multiple scandals, Parson gets his day in the spotlight when he delivers his first budget and State of the State address to the Legislature’s 100th  General Assembly.In the 3 p.m. speech on Wednesday, Parson is expected to focus heavily on boosting the state’s workforce in order to bring more jobs to the Show-Me State.

He also is expected to outline a new infrastructure improvement proposal after Missouri voters dumped a plan to raise the gas tax by 10-cents over four years. In a sign that high-level talks are underway, Missouri Department of Transportation Director Patrick McKenna was meeting with administration officials in Parson's office on Monday.And Lt. Gov. Mike Kehoe, who is a former head of the state Highway and Transportation Commission, suggested he might be playing a role in the governor's proposal.""The governor has some plans on some infrastructure development. I'll be paying particularly close attention and will be involved in that conversation,"" Kehoe said at a meeting of the Missouri Development Finance Board on Tuesday.Although Parson's staff remained tight-lipped about details, top agency officials say one of the governor’s plans includes a revamp of the Department of Economic Development, which is the state’s main job creation agency.“We are extremely excited about the changes that he will be proposing for the Department of Economic Development,” agency director Rob Dixon told the finance board. “It’s going to be a great week for economic development in the state of Missouri.”Kehoe, who took over for Parson after Greitens departed, called the governor’s plan for economic development a “rebirth” of the state’s strategy in growing jobs in Missouri.“I think it’s an appropriate step, a needed step,” Kehoe said.
Along with possible changes in agency operations, Dixon has asked for at least $27 million to double the amount spent on a job training program, including dollars that would go to train high-skilled workers.The move could boost the number of companies receiving job training assistance to 300, up from a current level of about 164.“A skilled workforce is a top criteria in a business’s ability to create and retain jobs,” the DED request notes.Parson also could call for a restoration of funds for tourism. Officials say cuts in the state’s tourism budget have resulted in a decrease in the state’s marketing budget. And now, a former top aide to Parson, Ward Franz, is running the Missouri Division of Tourism.
There also is a request for a $5 million grant program to help companies expand broadband internet service in rural areas.But the requests for increased spending come as at a time when Missouri’s tax collections have been described as “horrible.”For all Parson would like to do, he’ll have to find a way to keep spending in check as he outlines his first budget for the fiscal year beginning July 1.State Budget Director Dan Haug announced earlier this month that net general revenue collections for November 2018 decreased 9.1 percent compared with those for November 2017.Income tax revenue is down more than $400 million from the same time last year.Parson has already said he wants to begin collecting sales taxes from online purchases as a way to boost revenue in the state. That push comes after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in June that states can collect greater online sales taxes.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Fur flies over new no-dog rule in the Missouri House,"Jan 15, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/fur-flies-over-new-no-dog-rule-in-the-missouri/article_8bd39407-2e4a-5d64-8589-b30c41fa5574.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Missouri House officials have largely forbidden state representatives and staff from bringing animals to work, saying in a revised policy handbook that pets are antithetical to maintaining “a professional and respectful work environment free from unnecessary distractions or impediments.”At least two pet owner-legislators are objecting.“I just think it’s kind of disturbing,” state Rep. Maria Chappelle-Nadal, D-University City, who previously served in the state Senate, said of the new policy. Rep. Peter Merideth, D-St. Louis, said he was “extremely concerned and disappointed” to hear of the new rules.

During the heat of the 4½-month legislative session — when brains are taxed, hours are long and debates are heated — dogs play an emotional support role amid the chaos, Merideth said.“The dogs that we had there were really helpful when morale was down on tough days,” he said, adding that he understood legislators or employees who may be allergic to animals, or who don’t like the occasional accidents or barking.The animal restrictions mark the latest battleground in the near-constant tussle over Capitol rules. Gov. Mike Parson’s administration is reconsidering a policy allowing concealed carry of firearms in the building after 50 people voiced their opposition.The House is also considering an office smoking ban, which had not been enacted during the tenure of former House Speaker Todd Richardson, R-Poplar Bluff, who was known to smoke in his office. Smoking is mostly banned in the Capitol, but lawmakers can still light up in their private offices.The revised House handbook, released in October, says it is House policy to “prevent and preclude the presence of animals, fish or aquatic life, and reptiles from within House space” unless the animals are locked in vehicles in Capitol parking garage areas.There are exceptions. Service animals are allowed. So are “emotional support” animals, as determined on a case-by-case basis by the House Administration and Accounts Committee. Animals are allowed in hearings for testimony if legislation deals with the particular species. The Department of Conservation is also allowed to bring animals for presentations.The Administration and Accounts Committee approved the change unanimously on Oct. 22, according to the chief clerk’s office. The Senate has not followed suit. The two chambers are separated by the Capitol Rotunda but are connected by hallways.














        
            Boosting penalties for police dog assaults fizzles in Missouri House

""We care more about four-legged canines than we do about people that walk with two legs,"" one Kansas City Democrat said.




House Chief Clerk Dana Rademan Miller said in a statement that she has several family pets and “I understand how strong the bond can be with an animal companion,” but, “the Capitol is a public building with many shared spaces, which makes it important that we have policies that create a professional work space for our employees, and a safe environment for our many visitors. A pet can be a source of comfort for its owner, but can also be frightening to a visitor, a distraction for a co-worker, or even a threat to destroy taxpayer-funded property.”She said the policy is no different than in many workplaces, and added the new policy was “carefully constructed” to allow for “licensed service animals and certified emotional support animals.”Chappelle-Nadal brought Lily Freedom, her terrier/Chihuahua mix, to her Senate office on a regular basis. She has also brought Bartholomeus, or “Bart,” her 50-pound Australian cattle dog/Labrador retriever mix, on occasion.“Your office is the domain of your district, and if you have a pro-dog district like I do, then you should be able to have a dog,” Chappelle-Nadal said, adding that Lily Freedom came from a litter of puppies who all joined the homes of various Ferguson protesters.
“She’s a Ferguson puppy,” Chappelle-Nadal said.Merideth said he took Ella, a Maltese/Yorkshire terrier mix, to his office regularly. He estimated about 20 of his colleagues at least sometimes brought their dogs to work.A spokesman for the House Democrats said that prior to the 2018 legislative session, party leaders asked Democrats to stop bringing dogs to the Capitol.“I think there were a few legislative assistants who were not thrilled with dogs being around,” he said.“That was not a rule and it was not widely followed, although I stopped bringing my dog at that point,” Merideth said. He said it was “widely understood” that new Democratic leaders would reverse the directive, though House administrators moved forward with the restrictions anyway.
Merideth’s dog Ella has since died, and he and his wife recently purchased a miniature Labradoodle named Lucky.














        
            Soft on dog breeders? Some say Missouri gives long leash to problem kennels

For nearly three years, the state has not referred any new problem breeders to the attorney general's office.




“I had gotten this dog in part with a conversation with my wife that, yes, I would bring him to Jeff (City) and he’d be in the office with me,” Merideth said, “because she does not want me leaving him at home.”Chappelle-Nadal said she and Republicans formed bonds because of their mutual love for animals.For years, former state Rep. Kevin Engler, R-Farmington, who for a time was the Senate majority floor leader, brought his late English bulldog Winston to the Capitol.More recently, he brought Layla, a “prison mutt” his family got from the Puppies for Parole program.“My dog never caused problems to anybody,” he said. “I don’t understand the need for it, but whatever. They can do whatever they want. I wasn’t aware of one complaint.“My dog is smarter than some of the legislators that I worked with over the years,” Engler said.Editor's note: A previous version of this article misstated when Democrats were told not to bring dogs to the Capitol.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Governor says 'no' to moving state workers out of downtown St. Louis,"Jan 15, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/governor-says-no-to-moving-state-workers-out-of-downtown/article_a3b5828a-8ab7-58d3-997b-0b118d3634d6.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Missouri Gov. Mike Parson has rejected a request by a state agency to move some workers out of downtown St. Louis because of concerns about crime.With Parson set to unveil his spending blueprint on Wednesday, a spokesman told the Post-Dispatch he will not be asking for $61,000 to help relocate seven Department of Revenue attorneys out of a state-owned building at Seventh and Pine streets to a new office in Clayton.“That request is not going to be in our budget,” spokesman Steele Shippy said Monday.

Shippy said the move is not a priority at a time when the state budget for the fiscal year beginning July 1 is expected to be tight.The request by the department, first reported Friday by the Post-Dispatch, had set off alarm bells for downtown boosters and elected officials who represent the area.According to budget documents reviewed by the newspaper, the agency wanted the money to move out of the Wainwright State Office Building in the heart of downtown to an office in Clayton.“Employees are increasingly concerned about their safety while walking to the parking garage and the MetroLink Station,” the document said.St. Louis Mayor Lyda Krewson expressed concern about the request, which comes at a time when downtown is seeing “tremendous investment.” State Rep. Bruce Franks, a Democrat who represents downtown, called the request “crazy” and vowed to fight it if it was included in the budget forwarded by Parson.Missy Kelley, president of the Partnership for Downtown St. Louis said the state should work toward solving crime and perception problems in downtown, rather than moving people out.On Monday, Kelley said the governor’s decision was not a surprise.
“It would be a pretty significant statement for the governor to support an exit from the economic engine of the region without following up with a plan to address the concerns,” Kelley said.The agency’s attorneys cover cases in the St. Louis area and many of the surrounding counties. They handle impaired driving cases and other driver licensing cases along with administrative alcohol hearings, and motor vehicle titles and related issues.
Until 2012, the workers were in Clayton within two blocks of the county courthouse. But they moved to the historic St. Louis office building at 111 Seventh Street, which is owned by the state, because of an increase in Clayton area rent.Even before Parson said he would reject the request, it appeared as if the department was backing off using crime as the primary reason for moving.In a statement Friday, the department said it also was considering issues like parking, commute times and the number of cases they handle in other counties.But, as Shippy said, “That request was never approved by the governor’s office.”In 2018, a Post-Dispatch analysis showed two homicides occurred in the downtown area, compared to none in 2017.{p style=”text-align: center;”}Crime Tracker: See crime stats for the Downtown neighborhood and for the Downtown West neighborhood

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Nicole Galloway, lone statewide Democrat in Missouri, sworn into four-year term","Jan 14, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/nicole-galloway-lone-statewide-democrat-in-missouri-sworn-into-four/article_afe0dea2-a765-53ee-af0a-0a80bcb782f7.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Missouri’s only Democratic state official, Auditor Nicole Galloway, promised to expand her office's efforts to combat public corruption as she was sworn in Monday to a full four-year term.Former Gov. Jay Nixon, a Democrat, appointed Galloway to the post in 2015 after the death of then-Auditor Tom Schweich. Galloway, 36, won a full four-year term in November after beating challenger Saundra McDowell on an otherwise dismal night for Missouri Democrats.Since 2015, the auditor’s office had identified $300 million in “government waste, fraud, abuse and mismanagement” across the state, Galloway said in her inaugural speech.

As Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican, sat feet away among a crowd of dignitaries and supporters, Galloway pointed to a recent tax withholding miscalculation by his Department of Revenue as an issue that deserves scrutiny.Galloway said many Missourians will owe the state money this year because their earnings were not properly withheld from their paychecks.“The administration might have be trying to sweep this under the rug, but I will hold them accountable to you,” Galloway said in her address. “Missourians deserve transparency.”Parson told the Post-Dispatch after the ceremony that he doesn’t know what Galloway meant by holding the administration responsible.""I think everyone knows what the situation was. We're going to fix it,"" Parson said. ""It was a mistake. We were pretty much open about that from day one so I don't know what she's talking about there.""On top of the hundreds of millions of dollars in identified misused funds, Galloway said her office’s audits led to 38 criminal counts against public officials.“There is more out there,” Galloway said. ""More and more,"" she said, ""citizens and law enforcement officials are asking for our forensic auditing expertise when there’s theft or wrongdoing in government.”Galloway, in her speech, announced the creation of the Public Corruption and Fraud Division as a means of reaffirming her dedication to fight public corruption.
Galloway, after the ceremony, updated reporters on her office’s close-out audit of former Attorney General Josh Hawley’s administration. Galloway said last month she would give “heightened scrutiny” to allegations Hawley, a Republican, misused public resources to boost his winning U.S. Senate campaign.In December, Republican Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft asked for Galloway’s assistance investigating Hawley, noting her authority to issue subpoenas.She said Monday she has yet to issue any subpoenas to the attorney general’s office as part of the investigation.
“The secretary of state asked us to look at some allegations with heightened scrutiny, but I don’t know where that’s going to take us,” Galloway said. “It's not our job to assume facts, to assume the outcome. We just need to get to the bottom of it and see where that investigation takes us.”Former House Budget Chairman Scott Fitzpatrick, 31, was sworn in as Treasurer later Monday, replacing Eric Schmitt, a Republican, who was appointed attorney general by Parson after Hawley won election to the Senate.In his address, Fitzpatrick said he plans to make sure Missouri schools continue to be fully funded and businesses continue to grow. He also aims to promote “valuable programs” that help Missouri’s small business owners, parents saving up for their children’s education and people with disabilities.Fitzpatrick was first elected to the House in 2012. Before then was a full-time business owner, running MariCorp US., a Shell Knob-based marine manufacturing and construction company that he started in high school.“When people depend on you for a paycheck to provide for their families, you learn quickly how important strong decision making is, how important adequate planning is and how important it is to be responsible,” Fitzpatrick said.Fitzpatrick’s delayed transition makes him eligible to run for two additional four year terms after finishing out the last two years of Schmitt’s service.Kurt Erickson of the Post-Dispatch contributed to this report.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Editorial: Young futures hang in the balance as Warren County adopts four-day school week,"Jan 14, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-young-futures-hang-in-the-balance-as-warren-county/article_ee9f9902-3239-51f0-ac40-1a3521f58e39.html,"The Warren County School District is joining about 33 other Missouri districts on a risky experiment with four-day school weeks. Minimal evidence exists to suggest a four-day week improves academic performance, while it could lead to potentially serious social side effects for youths. Are the slight cost savings and potentially higher teacher-retention rates worth it?As the Post-Dispatch’s Christine Byers reported Monday, Warren County’s teacher turnover rates reached 20 percent last school year. The district, about 60 miles west of St. Louis, lacks funding to compete with neighboring districts’ higher salaries, so the gamble is that a shorter workweek would entice teachers to stay.The savings, however, are only about $300,000 a year, or less than 1 percent of the district’s budget. The district plans to add 33 minutes of class time to the remaining four days of school to meet the state minimum of 1,044 hours of instruction. But adding two hours and 12 minutes per week hardly substitutes for the loss of a full, uninterrupted academic day.

Research compiled by Harvard University and the Carnegie-Knight Initiative offers a murky assessment of the cost-benefit of a compressed academic week. Most of the 560 public school districts in the 25 states that adopted shorter weeks are in rural areas.The justification for switching more often leans toward accommodating adults than serving the academic needs of children, research suggested. A 2018 survey of 136 faculty and staff members in three Missouri districts that adopted a four-day week found higher adult morale and what they perceived to be a positive impact on academic quality. Any actual improvement in academic quality is unproven.
One major drawback, according to a 2018 study in Colorado, was that teens tend to have more free, unsupervised time on their hands, yielding a 20 percent increase in juvenile criminal offenses — including a 73 percent increase in property crimes — attributable to the four-day switch.
In New Mexico, consistently among the nation’s lowest in academic proficiency, lawmakers imposed a moratorium on districts switching to a four-day week pending further study of the costs and benefits. Several indicators suggest that poorer students suffer the most from the compressed schedule, although the research to date is hardly comprehensive.To their credit, Warren County officials plan to make adult supervision available for students on Mondays when they don’t have school. Morning and noontime meal service also will be available along with some tutoring.The gamble is significant for what could amount to a minimal payout. But the sad fact that it’s happening reflects increasingly dire economic conditions among Missouri public schools and the low priority state legislators give to funding and resources. Workforce development — one of Gov. Mike Parson’s top priorities — won’t happen unless the Legislature’s mindset changes about the importance of public education."
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Is downtown St. Louis safe? One state agency says 'no',"Jan 14, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/is-downtown-st-louis-safe-one-state-agency-says-no/article_bcef2755-b320-5270-a35d-59d86d2a69e9.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Is downtown St. Louis too crime-ridden and dangerous for state employees to work there?That’s the argument one state agency is making.A Post-Dispatch review of budget requests by state agencies shows the Missouri Department of Revenue is asking for money to move seven employees out of the Wainwright State Office Building in the heart of downtown to an office in Clayton.

“Employees are increasingly concerned about their safety while walking to the parking garage and the MetroLink Station,” notes a line item in the document.Although the $61,000 annual cost of the move is a tiny slice of spending in a $28 billion budget, the request could become the subject of debate as the House and Senate begin picking their way through the massive budget in the coming weeks.• UPDATE: Governor says 'no' to moving workersAlong with the symbolism of such a request, the move also could cost the city by reducing the amount it receives from its 1 percent earnings tax on people who work in the city. A breakdown on how much each of the seven employees earn was not immediately available. Based on the average salary of state employees of about $39,000, the cost to the city could be as much as $2,730 in annual revenue.Gov. Mike Parson, a former county sheriff, could put the topic to rest if he takes the request out of the budget before he introduces his spending blueprint next week.A spokesman for the governor did not have an immediate response Friday.Mayor Lyda Krewson told the Post-Dispatch that she never wants to see employees moving out of downtown.“We have a building boom going on and we’ve seen tremendous investment downtown. It is the hub of the region,” she said.Revenue Director Joel Walters has not met with House budget officials to discuss his agency’s request.In a response to questions from the Post-Dispatch and inquiries from the mayor, agency spokeswoman Anne Marie Moy suggested the request may be under review.“The department is evaluating the pros and cons of a move. Certainly, safety is among the factors to be considered for any location where we might have staff. Other considerations include things like parking, commute times and proximity to the work performed by employees. For example, the majority of cases handled by the 6-8 attorneys currently officed at the Wainwright Building are in Clayton and surrounding counties. So the logistics of that are things we need to consider moving forward,” Moy said in an email.Rep. Bruce Franks, a Democrat who represents downtown, was flabbergasted when told about the request.“That’s crazy,” Franks said. “That doesn’t make sense. I would definitely fight that, tooth and nail.”
The employees affected by the move work at the Missouri Department of Revenue’s legal office, which handles impaired driving cases and other driver licensing cases along with administrative alcohol hearings, and motor vehicle titles and related issues.The attorneys cover cases in the St. Louis metro area and many of the surrounding counties.Until 2012, the workers were in Clayton within two blocks of the county courthouse. But they moved to the historic landmark office building at 111 Seventh Street because of an increase in Clayton area rent.The 10-story Wainwright building, built in 1891, is known for being one of the world’s first skyscrapers.But, budget documents say, “since 2012, the crime and homicide rates in the vicinity of the Wainwright State Office Building continue to rise.”In 2018, a Post-Dispatch analysis showed two homicides occurred in the downtown area, compared to none in 2017.
In December, Police Chief John Hayden reported that the rate of homicides and violent crimes in St. Louis saw a substantial drop in 2018. He attributed the decrease to increased policing strategies in a highly afflicted area of the city north of Martin Luther King Drive.St. Louis saw a 20-year high in homicides in 2017, Hayden said, with 205 reported murders in total. Through Dec. 20 of 2018, the city saw 174 homicides.Robberies also fell by 25 percent in 2018, Hayden said, with 469 fewer reported.Hayden, who became chief a year ago, implemented a strategy of increased policing north of Martin Luther King Drive, south of West Florissant Avenue, east of Goodfellow Boulevard and west of Vandeventer Avenue.The policing strategies used in the targeted area included cracking down on open-air drug markets, increased visibility in traffic patrols and ticketing, assistance from the FBI and the Drug Enforcement Administration, an increase in security cameras and license plate reading cameras, implementing some community programs to engage with residents and employing an anti-crime task force citywide.Hayden plans to expand the use of special zone policing to other parts of the city this year, including downtown.The request by the state agency drew scorn from the Partnership for Downtown St. Louis, which promotes the city’s center core.“I find it ironic that a state department would decide that their best option is to leave rather than to work toward a solution,” said Missy Kelley, president and CEO of the partnership. “St. Louis is the biggest economic center of the state, and downtown St. Louis is the economic engine of the region. This is something we all have to own, and we all have to work at addressing.”Budget documents show no other state agencies are making requests to move out of downtown. Among the tenants in the building is the Missouri Department of Social Services, which administers aid programs benefiting low-income and disabled residents.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,GOP bickering marks beginning of legislative session in Missouri Senate,"Jan 10, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/gop-bickering-marks-beginning-of-legislative-session-in-missouri-senate/article_df76e35a-2a91-52d3-8600-11493c648b59.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • It wasn’t the kind of start Republicans hinted at when they launched the 100th Missouri General Assembly on Wednesday. Meeting in their first full day of the legislative session Thursday, Republican infighting brought chamber business to an immediate halt as an intra-party power battle broke out between rank-and-file lawmakers and newly installed Senate President Pro Tem Dave Schatz.The seven hour filibuster tested the resolve of Schatz and signaled the next four months could be a rocky affair, despite the GOP holding an iron grip on state government.

And, it came after Republican Gov. Mike Parson has been working to restore calm to a Capitol that was roiled last year by the scandal involving former Gov. Eric Greitens.The issue at the heart of the filibuster were proposed changes in the way the Senate operates.Schatz, a Sullivan businessman, for example, wanted to add two members to the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee, which helps write the state’s $28 billion budget.The expansion had the support of Senate Minority Leader Gina Walsh, D-Bellfontaine Neighbors, who said the additional slots could be filled by newly elected senators, giving them much needed experience in an age of term limits.Opponents, however, said the move — and other changes — would spread senators too thin and force them to miss hearings being held by the other 20 committees.“It’s gotten to where it just taxes everyone,” said Sen. Doug Libla, R-Poplar Bluff.Sen. Gary Romine, R-Farmington, led the pushback, saying there should be fewer committees altogether.“Instead of consolidating, we’re expanding,” said Romine, who laid blame for the filibuster at the feet of Schatz.
“It has to do with a lack of communication,” Romine said.Democrats needled Republicans for being unable to get through even one day without descending into disagreement.“This is our first real day and Republicans are infighting,” said Sen. Jamilah Nasheed, D-St. Louis. “If this is an indicator moving forward, it’s just appalling.”
Nasheed and Sen. Jill Schupp, D-Creve Coeur, said there are other issues the Senate should be spending its time on, such as a problem with the state’s income tax withholding tables that could result in people having to pay an income tax bill, rather than receive a refund.“This was a big mess up,” Schupp said.Sen. Bob Onder, R-Lake Saint Louis, said the changes proposed by Schatz came as a surprise to many members who thought the new leader would keep Senate rules intact.“I think that started us in a bad position,” Onder said.In the end, Schatz blinked first and brought the impasse to an end by removing one of the controversial provisions. The change was approved on a bipartisan 23-4 vote.Schatz said the issue could be revisited in the coming days.The legislation is Senate Resolution 19.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"With new leaders in place, Missouri lawmakers launch 100th session of the General Assembly","Jan 10, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/with-new-leaders-in-place-missouri-lawmakers-launch-th-session/article_148dd050-0f14-5cf5-9aa3-c76cd9a6d02e.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • After two years of battling with self-styled outsider Eric Greitens, Republican leaders opened the 100th session of the Missouri Legislature Wednesday sounding more aligned with the man who now sits in the governor’s office.From highlighting efforts to improve higher education and workforce development to pledging to tackle opioid abuse, newly elected leaders in the House and Senate signaled a potentially smoother four-month session than they’ve seen in recent years.At 36, House Speaker Elijah Haahr, a lawyer from Springfield , is among the youngest speakers in the nation.

“We are brimming with optimism and energy, ready to embrace innovative ideas for our state,” said Haahr, who takes the gavel from term-limited Speaker Todd Richardson, R-Poplar Bluff.Senate President Pro Tem Dave Schatz, R-Sullivan, spread a calming message amid the politically divisive atmosphere in Washington.“We can disagree without being disagreeable — it’s a choice we must consciously make every day. The work we do here isn’t glamorous, and it often attracts harsh and sometimes hurtful feedback — but it’s important work nevertheless,” Schatz said.Schatz, 55, an owner of a small business, outlined an agenda mirroring what Republican Gov. Mike Parson has said are some of his goals heading into 2019, including efforts to train future workers.“Advanced practical skills are the ticket to the middle class and economic prosperity. We need to invest in the citizens of our state by offering training opportunities — regardless of age or previous experience. Any Missourian that wants to better themselves through hard work and education should have their state as an ally — not as a hindrance,” said Schatz, who won the leadership post by a unanimous, bipartisan vote.In the Senate, Republicans hold a 24-10 advantage.Among the new faces are Sen. Brian Williams, D-University City, who replaces Sen. Maria Chappelle-Nadal, and Sen. Karla May, D-St. Louis, who takes over for former Sen. Jake Hummel after beating him in last year’s primary.Williams said he would spend the first few weeks of his tenure learning the procedures of the Senate and meeting his new colleagues.“I need to know how to put forth proposals in the process, but also how to block a lot of the bad legislation. That’s going to be priority of mine being in the minority here,” Williams said.Williams also said economic development and school funding would be a priority.“The district I represent has Clayton, one of the wealthiest municipalities, but also communities like Berkeley and Kinloch, which are some of the more poverty-stricken ones,” Williams said. “It’s imperative that we focus on economic development.”May said she was excited to continue to do the work she started in the House.“I like to just solve problems, so as problems arise in my district, I solve them.Right now we’re just trying to schedule meetings with the neighborhood organizations, community leaders, the community itself to find out what problems they really want solved, and that really will set my agenda for the Senate,” May said.In the 163-member House, there are 56 new members and six beginning their first full, two-year terms in the chamber after being elected in special elections.Rep. LaKeySha Bosley, D-St. Louis, is among the new members who believe they will bring new energy to the chamber.“I think with the new representatives and some of the old representatives, we can really propel our state forward and do some positive change,” Bosley said.“Across the board we need to focus on issues that cause our systemic issues which is education, criminal justice. They have a direct correlation with each other, so we have to fix that,” she said.
Another three members, including Rep. Chappelle-Nadal, D-University City, and Rep. Ron Hicks, R-Dardenne Prairie, are back for more after previously serving in the House.In all, Republicans hold 116 seats to the Democrats’ 47.In the House, Haahr took the gavel on a voice vote, but not before Democrats nominated House Minority Leader Crystal Quade, D-Springfield, to be speaker.After she delivered a speech, she withdrew her nomination.Quade said that although voters elected a Republican majority, they also approved “progressive” reforms such as a higher minimum wage, medical marijuana legalization, a package of ethics changes and the rejection of “right to work” legislation.“He has the opportunity to put the welfare of all Missourians above a purely partisan agenda that benefits only a few,” Quade said of Haahr.
Haahr said he would show respect for the minority party.“We won’t always agree on the policies; we will always agree on the goals: safer neighborhoods for our families, better education for our children, and a stronger economy for Missouri,” Haahr said.He said improving rural schools would be an agenda item, but was not clear as to whether expanding charter schools statewide would be a priority.“Our goal should always be this: to ensure that every child, and I mean every child, in this state gets a world-class education no matter their ZIP code,” Haahr said.He also said the Legislature would continue to combat the “opioid epidemic raging across our state.”Bills designed to reform the criminal justice system also will receive attention, Haahr said. And he said the House would defend the “innocent, the infirm, the born and the unborn.” At that point, he drew a standing ovation from Republicans while most Democrats held their applause.While the GOP appears set to work with Parson on education and other big issues, the majority party also is eyeing its losses at the ballot box.Republican lawmakers have filed at least nine pieces of legislation that would alter how voters can change the state’s Constitution after being on the losing end of a handful of initiative petitions.Parson also has goals for the legislative session, which include boosting workforce development, finding a way to increase spending on roads and bridges and reforming the state’s low-income housing tax credit programs.Looming over it all will be the Legislature’s push to approve a spending plan for the fiscal year that begins in July. It comes against the backdrop of lagging tax revenues, which were down 2.9 percent through the first half of the fiscal year.Budget officials expect that to rebound in the coming months.And lawmakers could act on proposals that would bump up the amount of money flowing into state coffers. Among them are an expansion of gambling via sports betting and video poker, as well as the collection of online sales taxes.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Editorial: 'Clean Missouri' means what it says, Gov. Parson. Don't mess with it.","Jan 9, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-clean-missouri-means-what-it-says-gov-parson-don/article_1279a8bf-33cf-5e63-bdde-9284e9b67881.html,"Gov. Mike Parson has made precious few missteps since taking over in June, and this is no time for him to mess up that record. He should rethink his suggestion of legislatively overriding the “Clean Missouri” ballot measure overwhelmingly approved by voters on Nov. 6.The people have spoken, and if Parson or any other politician in Jefferson City proposes to ignore their will, they deserve whatever voter backlash that comes their way. Parson in particular should be mindful of his own short leash. He was not elected to the governor’s office but arrived there only by virtue of his predecessor’s badly skewed moral and ethical compass.Parson promised a return to the straight and narrow path. First and foremost, that means upholding the will of the people. On Nov. 6, they voted overwhelmingly for Constitutional Amendment 1, the Clean Missouri ballot proposition. What Parson and others in the Republican majority don’t like is that Clean Missouri would revoke their party’s ability to gerrymander political districts in ways that effectively predetermine election outcomes and ensure one-party dominance.

Clean Missouri empowers the state demographer to map districts with emphasis on greater partisan fairness and competitiveness. Candidates would be forced not to rely on partisan affiliation as much as the power of their ideas and their ability to sway voters across the political divide.It’s a formula designed to encourage greater centrism, which is the space most Missourians occupy on key social issues. On Nov. 6 ballot items where there was no political party affiliation attached to the issue, voters across the state rejected hard-right extremism, overwhelmingly supporting Clean Missouri, legalization of medical marijuana and a mandatory increase in the state minimum wage to $12 an hour.
Whether Parson or other Republicans don’t like the result isn’t the point. It’s whether they’re willing to respect the democratic process. A slippery slope toward dictatorship awaits anyone who believes in legislatively invalidating elections that don’t go their way.
They are sending ominous signs: “Fundamentally, you think when the people vote you shouldn’t be changing that vote,” Parson told The Associated Press last month. “But the reality of it is that is somewhat what your job is sometimes, if you know something’s unconstitutional, if you know some of it’s not right.”Sen. Dave Schatz, now the Senate president pro tem, agrees: “I think it’s a major concern for this majority, in how that (Clean Missouri) is going to impact the future. And I do think those issues are going to have to be addressed there” with corrective legislative action.Even some Democrats, such as state Rep. Maria Chappelle-Nadal of University City, are expressing discomfort over the demographer’s new powers.All seem united in their dirty desire to protect political fiefdoms over democracy. Missouri voters should let them know, loud and clear, that Clean Missouri means what it says."
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Secretive phone apps installed on state phones during Greitens tenure,"Jan 9, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/secretive-phone-apps-installed-on-state-phones-during-greitens-tenure/article_1dd19704-8f86-5752-813a-9c0e0067b408.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • A special application that destroys text messages wasn’t the only secretive phone app used by then- Gov. Eric Greitens’ administration.Gov. Mike Parson’s administration confirmed Wednesday that some state phones from the Greitens era had a special security app that allowed users to schedule when their text messages are deleted.No current administration officials use the Silent Phone app, Parson spokesman Steele Shippy said.

Officials say the Silent Phone app was installed as part of the preparation for a trade mission in 2017 to help maintain secure communications while overseas.According to records obtained by the Post-Dispatch through the Sunshine Law, among those who had the Silent Phone app was Chief Operating Officer Drew Erdmann, who downloaded the service on the recommendation of the Missouri Highway Patrol.The app is designed for business and government employees who are concerned about protecting sensitive information from hackers.But Silent Phone also could make it harder for the public to see who is communicating with government officials about the public’s business. Records of such communication are generally public, and laws require such records to be retained and produced upon request.A similar application used by employees of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency became the subject of a federal lawsuit last year when the conservative group Judicial Watch asked a judge to force the agency to provide all employee communications sent using an app called Signal.Like Silent Phone, once texts are deleted from the Signal app, they are no longer available.Georgetown Law professor David Vladeck told Wired that deleting U.S. government records would blatantly violate the Federal Records Act.“It’s no different from taking records home and burning them,” Vladeck said. “They’re not your records, they’re the federal government’s, and you’re not supposed to do that.”The destruction of text messages by state employees also could violate the law. The governor’s office has a system for safeguarding emails, texts and records of phone calls, but it is unclear if any were texts destroyed by the Silent Phone app, because the app is designed to leave no trace that the record existed.In the email exchange obtained by the newspaper, Parson’s executive secretary Michelle Hallford — who also worked in Greitens’ administration — wrote that Erdmann needed to download the application, as well as one called “Content Blocker.”
“Drew needs both apps on his phone,” Hallford wrote.In response, Erdmann, who was hired by Greitens, wrote: “One is for secure comms recommended by HWP. The other enables me to back up my phone.”In a statement issued Wednesday, Erdmann said he stopped using the app more than a year ago. He also said it was not used to hide text messages.
“The app was strictly used as a security measure and pertained only to situations when safety and security necessitated within the Governor’s Office related to overseas travel (e.g. China, Middle East) or during domestic security events (e.g., aftermath of Stockley Verdict). The last time I recall using the app was in November 2017 while traveling for official business to the Middle East,” Erdman said.Capt. John Hotz, spokesman for the Missouri Highway Patrol, said the agency used the app to protect and encrypt sensitive operational information during high-risk situations such as the protests in Ferguson.“The app was also utilized by the Governor’s Security Division during a trip to China and Middle East. The app provided a hardened communication platform that prevented the information from being intercepted or hacked,” Hotz said.Greitens, who resigned June 1 under a cloud of scandal, was notoriously secretive in his 17 months on the job. He spent little time communicating with the Capitol press corps, installed a lock on the door to the press room and hasn’t made any public appearances since his departure.More than two dozen people in Greitens’ administration used or downloaded the Confide application, which destroys text messages between users.Open records advocates say using Confide to discuss public business would violate state records retention laws.The Confide usage remains a matter of litigation.Attorney Mark Pedroli, who sued the Greitens administration in 2017, said in October that Greitens and his team violated a May 31 court order requiring the governor’s attorneys to turn over the names of anyone in the office who at any time downloaded or used the Confide app.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,HUD Secretary Carson cancels visit to Missouri because of federal shutdown,"Jan 8, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/hud-secretary-carson-cancels-visit-to-missouri-because-of-federal/article_c7921f9c-e6d2-595d-91f2-5f0eac2b33ad.html,"JEFFERSON CITY – Officials have canceled a trip to Missouri by President Donald Trump’s housing czar because of the ongoing partial shutdown of the federal government.U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson had been scheduled to speak at the annual Governor’s Prayer Breakfast at a  Jefferson City hotel on Thursday.

But, the 2016 presidential candidate is no longer coming to the sold out event because of the standoff that has left federal agencies unable to operate, officials at HUD and Gov. Mike Parson’s administration confirmed Tuesday.
HUD is among the agencies grappling with the effects of the shutdown. For example, an estimated 1,150 Section 8 housing contracts for low-income renters have expired, which could delay repairs and potentially lead to the eviction of poor families who receive housing vouchers.
For now, the only other speaker listed on the schedule is Billy Russell, pastor of the First Baptist Church in Parson’s hometown of Bolivar. Russell also preached at Parson’s inauguration in June.The interfaith breakfast, first held in the 1950s, is an annual observance welcoming participants from around Missouri. It typically occurs at the beginning of the Legislature’s annual session.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Lobbyists have gotten away with paying for votes,"Jan 8, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/mailbag/lobbyists-have-gotten-away-with-paying-for-votes/article_d0c344de-a23a-54b8-9593-06ddb191e56e.html,"It is against the law in all 50 states to pay people for their vote, but for decades in Missouri, some lobbyists have been getting away with exactly that — by giving meals, sports tickets, trips and who knows what else to members of the Legislature in exchange for legislation favorable to their clients.If legislators take a gift from anyone and vote for or against legislation accordingly, they are being paid to vote one way or the other. Obviously then, state Sen. Dave Schatz was wrong when he said that the standard person can’t understand that, because 62 percent of the voters said yes to the ""Clean Missouri"" amendment, which will prevent that crime from happening all over Jefferson City.

The amendment also changed the process for drawing legislative districts so that it will be more fair and prevent people like Sen. Schatz and Gov. Mike Parson from so easily overturning the will of the people in the future, which is probably why they are trying to do it again now.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"With new leaders in charge, Missouri lawmakers return to action","Jan 7, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/with-new-leaders-in-charge-missouri-lawmakers-return-to-action/article_53d0ce23-c44c-5845-9c23-970fc759189a.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Wednesday marks the beginning of a new era in Missouri state government, with new leaders running the show after last year’s debacle over a scandal-plagued chief executive.Although Republicans hold an iron grip on state politics, the House and Senate are under new management, not to mention the governor’s office, where Mike Parson enters his first full legislative session after taking over for Eric Greitens in June.Lawmakers are set to begin their annual 4½-month journey at noon with a May 17 deadline.

Here’s a look at some of the issues expected to be debated by the 163-member House and the 34-member Senate:Initiative petitions and Clean Missouri • Republicans are coalescing around plans to tighten access to the initiative petition process after voters approved a constitutional amendment that directly targets the legislative branch.The GOP could move to reverse at least some of those changes — the most controversial is a new redistricting plan — by placing another measure on the ballot in 2020.Some legislators are moving to exempt some of their emails from public disclosure after Missourians voted to subject lawmakers to open-records statutes.Other proposals, which would require voter approval, would make it harder for constitutional amendments by raising the threshold necessary to pass a constitutional amendment.Prescription drug monitoring • The exit of former Sen. Rob Schaaf, R-St. Joseph, due to term limits may allow lawmakers to finally enact a plan to address the opioid abuse crisis.Schaaf had singlehandedly blocked efforts to approve the program citing privacy issues.Newly minted Senate President Pro Tem Dave Schatz, R-Sullivan, supports the creation of a prescription drug monitoring program to bring Missouri in line with the rest of the nation.But, he isn’t guaranteeing its passage. “We’re still going to have mixed feelings in our caucus about how we move forward,” Schatz said.Low-income housing tax credits • Though Parson criticized Greitens’ move in late 2017 to end Missouri’s involvement in the program, the new governor wants lawmakers to reform the incentive program so that the state can again issue the credits.School aid formula • In September, Rep. David Wood, R-Versailles, sent every superintendent in the state a letter outlining several changes he’s considering to how the state funds schools.Under state law, most of the money that goes to K-12 schools is appropriated through the “foundation formula,” which seeks to balance state funding between districts that can afford to raise their own taxes and those that can’t.Budget • Democrats expect the effects of a 2014 tax cut to manifest next fiscal year, forcing the state to make more tough budget choices, even as the Missouri’s economy is humming.“As House Democrats warned then, this tax giveaway for rich is resulting in serious consequences for everyone else,” said state Rep. Kip Kendrick, D-Columbia.But, budget planners are still anticipating 2 percent growth in general revenue next fiscal year. Incoming state Treasurer Scott Fitzpatrick, a Republican, said recently “that the state’s finances are on solid ground.”Online sales taxes • After the U.S. Supreme Court opened the door for states to collect online sales taxes, Parson began mapping out a plan to bring lawmakers on board with the idea.He dispatched his top tax expert to try and convince rank-and-file Republicans that the collection of millions of dollars of new tax revenue from out-of-state retailers will help shore up the budget.
Gambling expansion • After failing to advance the legalization of sports betting in recent years, lawmakers in both chambers are hoping 2019 is the year that Missouri allows bettors to wager money on their favorite teams.They also are pushing bills that would legalize video gambling at truck stops, restaurants and bars.Schatz said he’s going to move forward cautiously. “I don’t want to subject every person to ringing bells and slot machines when they are going into a convenience store to get a gallon of milk,” he said.Earnings tax • Although the issue has languished in recent years, Sen. Bill Eigel, R-Weldon Spring, says he wants to end the collection of a 1 percent earnings tax imposed on people who work in St. Louis and Kansas City.City officials say the repeal of the tax would gut their budgets and hurt services ranging from police and fire protection to road maintenance.Workforce development • Parson has made workforce development a key plank in his platform, saying the state needs to alter the way it provides educational opportunities for students by offering more certificates, apprenticeships, and alternative credentialing programs.
“In order to ensure Missouri is on the right track, we must give our students and workers the skills and tools to be successful,” Parson said.Higher education • Schatz said he wants lawmakers to consider a plan that would limit how much colleges and universities can raise fees, saying students need to know how much their education will cost before committing to a particular institution.“I think the rising cost of higher education is something we’ve got to get our hands around,” Schatz said.Transportation taxes • After voters turned down a plan in November to raise the gas tax by 10-cents over four years, Parson says he wants to find other ways to generate revenue to maintain and expand the state’s roads and bridges.Lawmakers could look at toll roads, increasing motor vehicle registration fees or other taxes in response to the rejection of the tax hike.“Missouri’s infrastructure needs are long overdue and now is the time to take action,” Parson said.Debtors prison • A bipartisan effort to end debtors prisons in Missouri could be brewing.Currently, Missouri allows judges to impose jail sentences on people who cannot pay the costs of previous jail stays, resulting in them being sent back to jail.Rep. Justin Hill, R-Lake Saint Louis, is sponsoring legislation that would address private probation companies, which he says are contributing to the problem.The issue also is on the radar of Rep. Bruce DeGroot, R-Chesterfield.Tort reform • Republicans will again go up against trial attorneys in an annual battle over tort reform.Among the items on the table are changes that would limit who can file lawsuits in an attempt to rein in the number of high profile cases that are brought in St. Louis by out-of-state plaintiffs.“The overall goal is that we make Missouri an attractive place to do business,” Schatz said.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Political adviser to Eric Greitens exerted authority over state workers, records show","Jan 5, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/political-adviser-to-eric-greitens-exerted-authority-over-state-workers/article_50493a22-9424-52a7-bf75-d874b521bab9.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • A political consultant from Georgia directed taxpayer-paid employees in Missouri during the early days of then-Gov. Eric Greitens’ doomed administration, according to a Post-Dispatch review of emails generated by the Republican governor’s team.Austin Chambers, now 23, was one of the architects of Greitens’ winning “conservative outsider” strategy in 2016.When Greitens took office in January 2017, Chambers approved policy rollouts, was copied on multiple drafts of Greitens’ first State of the State address, and had access to pending media inquiries, according to the emails.

The records, produced over the last several months to the Missouri attorney general’s office as part of an investigation of Greitens, so far cover a small time period: the post-election transition phase, plus Greitens’ first 3½ weeks in office.But the documents still offer a glimpse into the inner workings of the notoriously opaque administration.The records show that press secretary Parker Briden crafted posts for Greitens’ personal Facebook page, which could constitute a violation of the law because taxpayer resources cannot be expended on political purposes.Production of these records comes at a particularly awkward time for the Missouri attorney general’s office.Former Attorney General Josh Hawley, a Republican who was sworn in Thursday as a U.S. senator, faces an investigation by Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft, a Republican, and state Auditor Nicole Galloway, a Democrat, into whether he broke the law by allowing campaign consultants to direct taxpayer-paid staff.Now, Hawley’s successor, Eric Schmitt, a Republican, possesses evidence showing Greitens’ aides acted in similar ways.Hawley has denied any wrongdoing, arguing it was acceptable for campaign consultants to help with his official duties so long as they were not paid by the state.Schmitt said Wednesday that he would establish a “bright line” dividing his campaign operation from his office’s official duties, and added that he would not comment on any ongoing investigations.Steele Shippy, spokesman for Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican, told the Post-Dispatch that although it is normal for outsiders to offer advice and counsel to the administration, outsiders do not have “sign off” authority on press releases or on other matters.“Sign off does not come from an outside source,” Shippy said.Scott Holste, who worked as a spokesman for then-Gov. Jay Nixon, a Democrat, said Nixon trusted his taxpayer-paid staff to pull the levers of government. Before becoming governor in 2009, Nixon had served 16 years as attorney general.Nixon “had great confidence and trust in them,” Holste said. “Many of them came with him after serving with him for several years.”
In 1993, Missouri Attorney General William L. Webster, a Republican, was sentenced to two years in prison for conspiracy and embezzlement of state resources after an investigation revealed Webster was using state resources for political purposes.As an example of how Chambers directed staff, he signed off on a budget letter that was to be published at the front of an official state manuscript, which detailed Greitens’ plans for the state’s $28 billion annual budget.The letter includes digs at “insiders, special interests, lobbyists, and career politicians” who “have made a mess of our budget.”“Approved,” Chambers wrote on Jan. 27, 2017, after receiving the final draft.Parson’s legal team, responding to an open records request that the attorney general’s office made on May 11, is now producing thousands of records to investigators working for Schmitt.
Hawley, Schmitt’s predecessor, opened the probe when The Kansas City Star raised questions about Briden’s writing posts on Greitens’ Facebook page.Greitens’ administration had denied an open records request seeking information from the account, saying the account was private. Hawley, who enforces the state’s Sunshine Law, sided with Greitens.But when the newspaper pointed to records showing that Facebook messages were crafted by Briden, the attorney general’s office opened an investigation into misuse of official resources.In addition to showing that Briden had a direct hand in posting to Greitens’ social media accounts, emails that the attorney general’s office and the Post-Dispatch obtained suggest that Greitens’ political advisers had wide latitude to engage with taxpayer-paid staff.Mark Bobak, a long-time Greitens confidant, was allowed to park in a parking space at the Capitol reserved for the governor’s staff, according to emails.Campaign treasurer Jeff Stuerman and Greitens fundraiser Meredith Gibbons, who was paid $140,000 by Greitens’ dark-money nonprofit A New Missouri in 2017, also were in contact with state employees.Besides running Greitens’ campaign, Chambers worked for A New Missouri, which took in $6 million in 2017 and has not revealed the source of any of the money.The records show that while Greitens was in Washington for President Donald Trump’s inauguration, he was scheduled to meet briefly with then- Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., who has advocated for warmer relations between the United States and Russia.Monu Joseph, a California venture capitalist, was described as the “on site contact” for the meeting. Joseph is listed as the current president of A New Missouri.One of Greitens’ former campaign aides has testified that Joseph had discussed ways to solicit campaign donations from foreign nationals, which would be a violation of federal law.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Opponents say guns in the Missouri Capitol 'unnecessary and dangerous',"Jan 5, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/opponents-say-guns-in-the-missouri-capitol-unnecessary-and-dangerous/article_432fe90c-de16-5594-8685-9ff00f8ba7ff.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • When Gov. Mike Parson’s administration proposed a plan to allow visitors to carry guns in the Missouri Capitol, they asked for comments about the policy from the public.The response was an outcry of opposition. Every one of the 50 comments that flowed in between mid-November and mid-December opposed the plan, saying firearms should not be allowed in the building, even if the owners have concealed carry permits.“I will not allow my children to attend any field trips if this is allowed,” said one respondent in a trove of emails and letters obtained by the Post-Dispatch.

“At the present time, visitors are not permitted to bring knives into the Capitol building. Balloons are not allowed either. What is the rationale for allowing firearms, the most deadly weapons of all, on the property?” wrote another.It remained unclear Friday whether the unanimous opposition had the administration rethinking the policy, which was quietly announced in November.“The Office of Administration is reviewing the public comments and is working to complete that review,” agency spokeswoman Brittany Ruess said.But, given the response from the public, the issue could become the subject of a hearing later this year by a panel of lawmakers charged with reviewing administrative rule changes affecting state government operations.The dust-up over guns in the Capitol began two years ago when Parson’s predecessor, Eric Greitens, temporarily barred most visitors and employees from bringing concealed firearms into the building.Some lawmakers balked at the ban. Outgoing Rep. Nick Marshall, R-Platte County, for example, said the ban infringed on the rights and freedoms of visitors to the Capitol.After the prohibition took effect, Marshall erected a sign on his office door in the Capitol offering to lend guns to people while they visit the building.Greitens, who left office under the cloud of scandal on June 1, reversed course a month later and said guns would be OK if the owners had permits.Owners would be limited in where they could take their weapons. Under the proposed rule, no firearms are allowed in the House or Senate chambers nor in committee hearing rooms.
Some opponents wrote that they were mystified about why the rule should be made permanent.“In today’s environment of hyper-partisanship and with politically motivated incidents of violence on the rise across the country, why would Missouri lawmakers entertain such an idea at this particular moment in time?” one wrote.“I believe a rule allowing this is both unnecessary and dangerous,” wrote another.In a handwritten note to the administration, one woman said Capitol visitors already must go through metal detectors to enter the facility.
“So why would people also need to carry firearms for safety when all visitors would already be screened?” she asked.Ruth Ehresman and Mary Clemons, co-presidents of the University City-based Women’s Voices Raised for Social Justice, also weighed in on behalf of the organization’s 1,600 supporters.“Many school groups visit the Capitol. Children and teachers should not be subjected to people with firearms roaming the building,” they wrote.The administration has until mid-February to submit the rule, either in its original form or an amended version, to the Legislature’s Joint Committee on Administrative Rules.The committee would then have 30 days to sign off on the change or reject it.The administration also has the option to withdraw the rule from consideration.That’s the route all of the respondents are advocating.“This rule should not be enacted,” wrote one woman. “This rule is a bad idea!”

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Democratic, Republican parties drown out independent voices","Jan 4, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/mailbag/democratic-republican-parties-drown-out-independent-voices/article_add685e5-c4eb-5ce9-ba32-518031ba5ac7.html,"Missouri citizens need better government representation. Our Republican and Democratic parties have become the largest and most powerful self-serving corporations in our nation. Too many of their work force, the elected members of their parties, owe allegiance to their leaders' platforms. Their job description includes raising money for their party's war chest, and when it comes time to speak up and vote on issues, they infrequently go against party positions.Today, these two political machines are so wealthy and well-honed that it is almost impossible for an independent candidate to compete against their treasure chests, political district alliances and their highly specialized image marketing teams. If a person wants to get elected, he or she is highly encouraged to give allegiance to the Democratic or Republican ""corporations.""

Dissatisfied with this predicament, the public has discovered new success via the citizen initiative petition. Now that these citizen initiatives are beginning to infringe upon party turf, Missouri Gov. Mike Parson intends to make it harder for citizen initiatives to make it to the ballot. Further, he intends to rewrite the recent ""Clean Missouri"" citizen initiative state amendment to be more what he wants, not what the voters approved.
Our leaders have already rewritten past successful citizen initiatives regarding puppy mills and handguns. Gov. Parson has lost the spirit of government by the people and for the people. If we do nothing, he will make citizen initiative petitions harder to institute, rewrite ones that do pass and continue gerrymandering to his ""corporation's"" advantage. This is outright tyranny of the people's representation. We need independent voices.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Move to stack clean water panel with farm-friendly allies wins round in court,"Jan 4, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/business/local/move-to-stack-clean-water-panel-with-farm-friendly-allies/article_f943b98f-677e-542e-880e-370c4d755e65.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • A Republican-led effort to stack the state’s Clean Water Commission with farm-friendly appointees has survived a court challenge.In a ruling issued Tuesday, Missouri’s Western District Court of Appeals affirmed a decision by the commission to grant a permit for a large factory hog farm in Grundy County.In doing so, the judges rejected arguments by opponents of the hog farm that the members appointed by former Gov. Eric Greitens had conflicts of interest because of their ties to agriculture.

“The due process basis for disqualifying a commissioner from participating in a proceeding before an administrative agency thus requires proof of actual bias or the probability of actual bias, as distinguished from the mere appearance of an impropriety sufficient to require judicial recusal,” the decision said.At issue is a 6,000-plus swine operation planned near the northern Missouri town of Trenton. A coalition of nearby residents known as Hickory Neighbors has been fighting construction since 2015, arguing the facility could pollute the region’s water and air.The Minnesota-based company said it will annually apply about 4.4 million gallons of manure on 784 acres of nearby fields.In 2016, Missouri’s Republican-controlled Legislature overrode then-Gov. Jay Nixon’s veto of legislation that would give farming and mining companies a larger say in the state’s water policies. Nixon is a Democrat.Supporters said the change in the membership of the Clean Water Commission was needed because members of the public lack the expertise to make good decisions regarding the effects of industry on the state’s waterways.Opponents said it would allow future governors to stack the board with members who represent industries that pollute.With the law in place, Greitens named a trio of new members in 2017, including Stan Coday, John Kleiboeker and Pat Thomas.
Coday is a farmer and retired agriculture teacher from Mansfield, Mo. He also serves as president of the Wright County Farm Bureau.Kleiboeker is the owner of Kleiboeker’s Clover Creek Farms in Stotts City, Mo., and previously served as the executive director of the Missouri Beef Industry Council.He has since left the board.Thomas, at the time, was the chief of staff for Sen. Brian Munzlinger, R-Williamstown, a farmer who sponsored the membership change. Thomas, of Jefferson City, earned her bachelor’s degree in agriculture from the University of Missouri and is secretary of the Missouri Republican Party State Committee.
The trio joined commission chairwoman Ashley McCarty, who is a cattle farmer from Kirksville. Attorney J. Benton Hurst, of Kansas City, whose father is Missouri Farm Bureau President Blake Hurst, also was on the board at the time, but has since left.In August, Gov. Mike Parson, a cattle farmer, appointed Allen Rowland, of Dexter, to a vacant seat on the commission.Rowland is a retired farmer, who has served on the Missouri Soybean Merchandising Council and has been involved with the Missouri Farm Bureau, Stoddard County Farm Bureau, and Missouri Corn Growers Association.The board has two vacancies.Attorney Stephen Jeffery, of Chesterfield, who is representing the Hickory Neighbors organization, said the group intends to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court. “Naturally, my clients are disappointed,” Jeffery said. “The people who are opposed to these concentrated animal feeding operations are local residents who live in extremely close proximity to where these facilities are going to be built.”Among the issues that could arise in the appeal is whether the Legislature’s passage of the changes to the makeup of the commission was constitutional.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Missouri gets a new attorney general, officials hope for calm","Jan 3, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-gets-a-new-attorney-general-officials-hope-for-calm/article_d54d2c5a-a142-5723-873f-2cdcc551ab2e.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • After a tumultuous 2018 filled with talk of impeachment and an expensive and heated election for U.S. Senate, Missouri officials moved closer to bringing some calm to state government Thursday.In a ceremony in the lobby of the Missouri Supreme Court building, Republican Eric Schmitt was sworn in as Missouri’s 43rd attorney general. He was appointed to the post by Gov. Mike Parson.Schmitt, 43, replaces fellow Republican Josh Hawley, who was sworn in as U.S. senator Thursday in Washington after beating two-term incumbent Democrat Claire McCaskill in November.

Now, with one more vacancy to be filled, Parson told the Post-Dispatch that he’s hoping to put a year of upheaval in the rear view mirror.“I think the one thing we’ve really got to get back on track on is making sure we all understand we’re public servants. And, above everything else, we should be working for the people every day,” Parson said.Parson, who ascended to the top post in state government after Republican Eric Greitens resigned amid scandal, said he wasn’t concerned that the remaking of state government has resulted in four statewide offices being held by people who weren’t elected to those posts.“It’s unusual circumstances. We’ve never been down this road before,” Parson said.The final domino will fall on Jan. 14, when Rep. Scott Fitzpatrick, R-Cassville, who also was appointed by Parson, is sworn in to replace Schmitt as treasurer for the final two years of that term.Schmitt, of Glendale, said he will keep politics out of the office after allegations surfaced during Hawley’s tenure that political consultants had embedded themselves in the official workings of the office to help Hawley plot his bid for Senate.“We have a bright line here of making sure the folks in this office focus on doing the work of the attorney general’s office,” Schmitt said.Schmitt, who will oversee an agency with about 300 employees, has already chosen top aides in his office, including Cristian Stevens as deputy attorney general for criminal litigation and Tom Albus as first assistant attorney general, both of whom are former U.S. prosecutors.
“The job of attorney general of the great state of Missouri is a serious responsibility, and as the state’s chief legal officer, I take that responsibility seriously,” he said in a short address after being sworn in by Missouri Supreme Court Chief Justice Zel Fischer.Since being named to the post in mid-November, Schmitt said he’s been on the hunt for attorneys for the office.“All I’m doing is recruiting,” he said.Schmitt offered few specifics on how he’d run the office differently than Hawley but said he wants to focus on addressing opioid abuse and supporting county prosecutors.
“People deserve to feel safe,” Schmitt said.Schmitt also is considering adding the ZIP code of drivers to a report his office produces that tracks racial profiling by police in vehicle stops. That could help determine if a disproportionate number of black motorists are being pulled over in predominantly white municipalities.Schmitt also has suggested he would use his new job to address perceived injustices within the state’s criminal justice system — an issue he took on during his tenure in the Senate where he sponsored legislation after the 2014 Ferguson protests aimed at stopping police departments from aggressively issuing traffic tickets to raise revenue.“My job, my duty is to protect Missourians, and I’ll work hard every single day to do just that,” Schmitt said.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Opioids in Missouri: Taking on a massive public health crisis,"Jan 2, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/columnists/opioids-in-missouri-taking-on-a-massive-public-health-crisis/article_39632c55-34c2-5420-ac51-f91e813d4561.html,"In 2016, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that 67,265 Americans died from drug-induced causes, six times the number of people that died from gun violence in the same year. The opioid crisis also creates a significant economic hindrance. In Missouri alone, opioid use disorder and overdose deaths cost the state $34.5 million each day — or $12.6 billion per year. This was 4.2 percent of the state’s GDP in 2016.There are steps being taken to combat this public health epidemic. At a forum Dec. 6, Gov. Mike Parson, along with St. Louis Mayor Lyda Krewson, proposed a statewide prescription drug monitoring program through a database that tracks controlled substance prescriptions. We are currently the only state in the U.S. without one despite the CDC’s belief that they are “among the most promising state-level interventions to improve opioid prescribing, inform clinical practice, and protect patients at risk.”I commend the governor and Mayor Krewson, and am in full support of their proposal. Additionally, I hope we can take our efforts a few steps further. A problem of this magnitude requires a diversity of solutions, and taking on such a massive public health crisis requires a deep and intimate knowledge of opioid use, misuse and abuse across Missouri.

Indiana has recognized the need for a more robust understanding of this issue. In response, they have implemented a tool that makes law enforcement and the public more equipped to defeat the scourge of overdose deaths in their state. The Naloxone Administration Heat Map is a visual database that allows anyone to see exactly where first responders are administering naloxone in Indiana. Naloxone, or Narcan, is a medication that reverses the effects of an opioid overdose without any tangible side effects, increasing the amount of lives saved.I believe Missouri needs to implement our own statewide, easily accessible Naloxone Heat Map. If we were to do so, we would accomplish a few important goals, and move closer to significantly decrease the lives damaged by opioid narcotics.This step would ensure that our state can properly allocate life-saving resources to the areas where they are needed most. This way, first responders in areas with the highest levels of risk could go into each 911 call ready for anything. There is a common misconception that one dose of Narcan is sufficient in each case. In fact, first responders can sometimes administer many doses, depending on the amount and method of injection of the drug.
This interactive map would also improve public awareness. Missourians would be able to see that the opioid problem is not distant, but a local issue that reaches every part of our state. My hope is that this tool could shine a light on the reality that opioids have the potential to affect all Missourians, regardless of socioeconomic status.In St. Louis, the fire department is already tracking Narcan administration in the city, and the city’s health department has been conducting interviews after an overdose by reaching out to family members to gather demographic data about victims. By taking the good work that these entities are already doing and simply implementing their efforts statewide, we can begin to move toward an effective solution without reinventing the wheel.
I hope that the residents of Missouri will join me in the call to establish this statewide tool. Although it won’t solve all of the problems surrounding the opioid crisis, it can be a leap in the direction of putting our state at the forefront of containing and eliminating this significant national public health crisis.To make your voice heard, call your state representative and let him or her know that you would like to see Missouri implement a statewide Naloxone Administration Heat Map.Missouri State Rep. Donna Baringer is a Democrat from St. Louis and a formerSt. Louis alderman."
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Delayed swearing in date could help new Missouri treasurer skirt term limits,"Jan 2, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/delayed-swearing-in-date-could-help-new-missouri-treasurer-skirt/article_1c5c5abe-14bb-5c62-ae1a-68d09089ee40.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Treasurer Eric Schmitt will be sworn in as Missouri’s next attorney general on Thursday, the same day fellow Republican Josh Hawley becomes the state’s next U.S. senator.But Schmitt’s replacement, even though he’s already been appointed by Gov. Mike Parson, won’t be sworn into office until Jan. 14, leaving a gap of 11 days in which the state will not have an official state treasurer.For Rep. Scott Fitzpatrick, R-Cassville, the delay could be beneficial.

Under state law, if an appointee to be treasurer holds the office for more than two years, he or she cannot run for more than one additional four-year term.The current term ends Jan. 11, 2021. Thus, by waiting until Jan. 14, Fitzpatrick would be able to run for two full terms, giving him the possibility of holding the $107,700-a-year job for a decade.Fitzpatrick said more factors than just term limits went into picking that day.“There were more considerations than just that,” he told the Post-Dispatch Wednesday.“I think part of that was, one, I needed to get some of my personal affairs in order,” Fitzpatrick said. “And, there are some personal financial issues, such as holdings and investments, that have to be reviewed.”In addition, it is the same day Auditor Nicole Galloway, a Democrat, is being sworn in.
The tactic isn’t a new one. Lawmakers elected in special elections have routinely kept a close eye on the calendar to determine if their swearing-in date will be affected by the limits on legislative terms.Such a consideration wasn’t an issue for Schmitt, because the attorney general position is not term-limited.Fitzpatrick, first elected to the House in 2012, was the latest domino to fall in a remake of the top echelon of state government in the wake of former Gov. Eric Greitens’ resignation last year.
Parson, who had been lieutenant governor, took over June 1. He then appointed former Senate Majority Floor Leader Mike Kehoe to his old job.After Hawley beat U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill in November, Parson appointed Schmitt to replace Hawley. Then came Fitzpatrick’s appointment to replace Schmitt.Fitzpatrick, who was chairman of the powerful House Budget Committee, represents Barry County plus parts of Stone and Lawrence counties. He is the founder of MariCorp U.S., a Shell Knob-based marine manufacturing and construction company.Schmitt, a former state senator from Glendale, is scheduled to be sworn in at 11:05 a.m. Thursday in the lobby of the Missouri Supreme Court.Hawley will be sworn in Thursday afternoon in Washington.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Editorial: Old problems and a few new ones await Legislature's action in 2019,"Jan 1, 2019",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-old-problems-and-a-few-new-ones-await-legislature/article_6a576a11-a705-5787-b007-fd656cc5caf2.html,"Missouri’s highways are crumbling. Its most vulnerable citizens lack health care access. And local court systems are running debtor-jail schemes that abuse the rights of poor defendants.These are just some of the top-priority issues that Missouri lawmakers must address in the 2019 legislative session. Others include opioid-prescription monitoring, internet sales taxes and a troublesome little phone app that just won’t go away even though it’s great at making public records disappear.Missouri’s dilapidated transportation infrastructure is the product of years of legislative neglect. Our state has one of the lowest fuel taxes in America at 17 cents a gallon, which lawmakers have refused for two decades to raise. Drive our highways to feel the results.

So organizers this year steered a fuel-tax increase onto the Nov. 6 ballot — containing, unfortunately, a convoluted funding plan and confusing ballot language. Its defeat may well have been the result of that confusion and not a rejection of the solid underlying idea of modernizing the fuel tax rate to fix and modernize our roads.The conundrum for legislators is that the voters have spoken. They’d rather have crummy roads than pay a few cents more for gasoline. State lawmakers should respect the will of the people and not try to override the Nov. 6 vote by approving their own fuel tax hike. But they should try to come up with better ballot language for a new referendum to raise the fuel tax for infrastructure improvements.They should offer it as soon as possible, written in clear language and stripped of any confusing side issues. Gov. Mike Parson and legislative leaders in both parties recognize the need for some kind of improved funding mechanism and should unite behind a new referendum. And this time, the voters of Missouri should get it right.Missouri’s health care situation is even more politically fraught, entangled with entrenched partisanship and bullheaded ideology. It’s time for ruling Republicans to set that aside and serve their constituents — including the poorest and sickest.The Affordable Care Act of 2010 was designed to include a state-by-state expansion of Medicaid, the federal government’s health care program for the poor. In Missouri, that would extend health care coverage to as many as 300,000 citizens, aid our struggling hospitals and pump billions of dollars into the state’s economy.But because of the ACA’s unofficial nickname — “Obamacare” — Republicans in 14 states, including Missouri, are still saying “thanks but no thanks” eight years later to extra federal dollars that would help fund health care for the uninsured.As those Republicans continue their stubborn stand, the ground has shifted under them. Polls show Americans now see health care access as a fundamental right. A Republican Congress has been unable to repeal Obamacare, and the GOP was decimated nationally on Nov. 6 in House races that hinged largely on health care.
By continuing this fight, Missouri Republicans are denying Missouri’s poorest citizens a basic right they would have in most other states. Enough. The Legislature and governor should, at long last, expand Medicaid.That promises to be a heavy lift. A much easier one should be ending the shameful practice in too many rural Missouri court systems of squeezing poor defendants for profit and jailing them for their poverty.Post-Dispatch columnist Tony Messenger has charted the practice for months in a series of columns exposing a Dickensian system of debtors jails. People who are arrested and tried for minor offenses are charged for their jail time. If they can’t pay, they are sometimes jailed again, racking up still more expenses.No one is suggesting that people who break the law, even in minor ways, shouldn’t face consequences — but they shouldn’t face repeated jail stays and years of indebtedness for misdemeanor offenses. Bipartisan legislation has been filed to end the practice. Residents from the state’s Republican-dominated rural districts are the ones suffering most from this abusive system, which means that legislators from rural Missouri should be leading this charge.
Another slam-dunk should be approval of a statewide prescription drug monitoring program of the kind Parson has been calling for.Despite the growing cost of opioid addiction, Missouri remains the only state without a statewide system to adequately prevent “doctor shopping” and other practices used to obtain often-lethal doses of opium-derived painkillers. Concerns about privacy have prevented approval of such a system in the past, but with term limits forcing out the main legislative opponents to a statewide database, the issue can be addressed anew with a strong likelihood of passage. Parson should have full legislative support on this.Among other 2019 agenda items:• A U.S. Supreme Court ruling last year opens the way for states to tax internet sales, even when the seller has no physical presence in the state. For small Missouri brick-and-mortar businesses, it’s a matter of basic fairness. The roughly $200 million a year Missouri could realize sweetens the deal. The Legislature should tax internet sales.• The phone app Confide, which erases text messages after they’re exchanged, was a controversy at the start of 2018 when it was revealed then-Gov. Eric Greitens and his staff were using it for official business. In effect, it meant they were complicit in the destruction of public records they were required to retain. Additional revelations about Confide’s use in other offices have since arisen. Public records are public records regardless of format; this modern version of disappearing ink should be banned by law from all government communications.• The tax paid on income earned in St. Louis is an important part of the city’s budget, provided largely by people who live outside city limits but use and enjoy the city’s amenities. The latest effort to kill the earnings tax is especially galling, as it’s coming from a legislator who doesn’t even live in the city, state Sen. Bill Eigel, R-Weldon Spring. With all due respect, senator, please butt out."
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Will Missouri lawmakers make it harder to change the state's constitution?,"Dec 29, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/will-missouri-lawmakers-make-it-harder-to-change-the-state/article_1a1ddf7b-9bc5-5495-a16a-86d4efc6aaf3.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • After voters overwhelmingly adopted a new redistricting plan this year that could reduce Republican dominance in Missouri, state party leaders are increasingly coalescing around proposals to undo those constitutional provisions and tighten access to the initiative petition process.Although Republicans again won two-thirds majorities in both legislative chambers, voters stung the GOP three times in six months on high-profile ballot items.Aided by an avalanche of spending by liberal groups and unions, campaigners convinced voters to raise the minimum wage, reject a GOP-backed “right to work” law and enact a suite of ethics rules that included the new redistricting plan for state legislative districts.

Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican, told the Associated Press last week that he would campaign for a new ballot measure to reverse the redistricting elements of the so-called “Clean Missouri” initiative.“Fundamentally, you think when the people vote you shouldn’t be changing that vote,” Parson said. “But the reality of it is that is somewhat what your job is sometimes, if you know something’s unconstitutional, if you know some of it’s not right.”Parson also indicated he would back efforts to restrict the ability to place any new questions on the ballot.“We’re not at all denying the ability to do it,” Dan Mehan, the president of the Missouri Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said of initiative petition efforts. “But we just want to make sure we’re approaching it in a proper way.”The Clean Missouri ethics push seems to have rankled Republicans the most.Sixty-two percent of voters supported the changes. Besides redistricting changes, changes include limiting lobbyist gifts and subjecting legislators to the Sunshine Law.In response, one Republican state senator filed legislation that would exempt constituent emails and other communications from disclosure. The Missouri Republican State Committee donated $150,000 on Nov. 21 to a group called Fair Missouri, which is seeking to undo the redistricting changes.Sen. Dave Schatz, R-Sullivan, the incoming leader of the Missouri Senate, said Republican leaders were still studying the full impact of Clean Missouri.But he suggested legislators would debate raising the threshold necessary to pass a constitutional amendments. In Florida, for example, proposed amendments need 60 percent support to take effect.“Maybe we need to raise the threshold as to what it requires to amend the Constitution,” Schatz said.Mehan agreed, saying: “In Missouri, it’s 50 percent plus one vote to change the constitution. Do we want to make that two-thirds? Sixty (percent)?”He also suggested requiring petitioners to collect signatures in each of Missouri’s eight congressional districts.To put a statutory change on the ballot, petitioners must now gather signatures of 5 percent of registered voters in six of eight congressional districts. To modify the constitution, signatures from 8 percent of voters in six districts is required.
“If we’re going to do some sort of constitutional change, then let’s make sure we get people in all eight districts — not just six — expand it to be a truly statewide effort rather than three-quarters of the state,” Mehan said.Several lawmakers have filed resolutions that would place such questions before voters. It is unclear whether Republicans will attempt to change rules only for constitutional questions, or if statutory changes and voter referendums on state laws could also see tougher standards.One change, Senate Joint Resolution 1, sponsored by Sen. David Sater, R-Cassville, would require constitutional amendments to receive two-thirds of the vote to pass.Under his version, amendments placed on the ballot simply for the purpose of repealing any amendment passed before 2021 would need to be approved by only a simple majority — meaning it would be easier to repeal older amendments and harder to enact new ones.
Jack Cardetti, who ran this year’s winning campaign to legalize medical marijuana in Missouri, said the initiative petition process was an “important mechanism” for groups to bring issues directly before voters.“Missourians have a long tradition of being able to directly petition their government for change,” Cardetti said. “That is an important mechanism in our democracy to bring issues to the forefront that are being ignored in Jefferson City.”As evidenced by vote counts this year, the Legislature is often out of step with voters on big issues. Cardetti’s Amendment 2, known as New Approach Missouri, passed with nearly 66 percent of the vote after years of sputtering in the Legislature — even though medical marijuana efforts did gain bipartisan support.Sixty-two percent of voters chose to raise the minimum wage through a statutory change, which lawmakers had declined to do. Sixty-five percent of voters rejected the right-to-work law, which then-Gov. Eric Greitens, a Republican, touted as his signature achievement.Cardetti said the ballot box backlash was due to the disconnect between voters and the Legislature.Mehan countered that out-of-state, left-leaning groups spent big on many of the successful campaigns last year — casting doubt on the assertion there is grassroots enthusiasm for policies that Democratic voters tend to support.Cardetti said Republicans had used the petition process, too — most notably in 2010 when St. Louis financier and Republican donor Rex Sinquefeld pushed a successful ballot question that banned earnings taxes outside of St. Louis and Kansas City. The measure also forces the two cities to reauthorize their taxes every five years.“That would never have been able to pass the Legislature,” Cardetti said.But, Cardetti said, some proposals to tighten the process are worth a look, such as one backed last year by Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft, a Republican.The legislation would have raised various fees to discourage frivolous petitions, which eat up state resources. Ashcroft also hinted he would support the attempt to raise the threshold needed to change the Constitution.“It is important to improve the initiative petition process, such as finding a method to reject frivolous petitions earlier in the process,” Ashcroft said in a statement, “and ensuring our constitution isn’t changed without broad agreement while still protecting the citizens’ right to petition their government. I look forward to the Legislature’s debate.”

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Parson and Schatz show disregard for Missouri voters,"Dec 28, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/mailbag/parson-and-schatz-show-disregard-for-missouri-voters/article_bc8372ef-b5fe-5f47-ba13-a0df5f7fd1f1.html,"In ""Parson wants repeal of redistricting law"" (Dec. 24), Gov. Mike Parson was quoted as saying that undoing the overwhelming voter approval of Amendment 1 in the Nov. 6 election is ""what your job is sometimes, if you know something's unconstitutional, if you know some of it's not right."" Of the voter-approved changes to the redistricting process, he said ""I think that's so questionable.""In the same article, state Sen. Dave Schatz is quoted as saying ""there's a lot more to it (Amendment 1) than what the standard person can understand.""

How dare they insult the 62 percent of Missouri voters who approved Amendment 1 (nearly 1.5 million voters) by saying we didn't understand or that we voted for something that's not right. Is Parson now the judge of what is ""right"" or unconstitutional in Missouri? What evidence does Schatz have that voters did not understand what they were voting for?
They are showing their disrespect and disregard not only for Missouri voters, but also for our essential democratic processes.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Raasch: 2018 was the 'Shock Me' year in Show Me politics,"Dec 28, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/gateway-to-dc/raasch-was-the-shock-me-year-in-show-me-politics/article_b188006e-9cad-5102-8a10-ddefd3dd78af.html,"WASHINGTON • Missouri lost a governor and an incumbent senator in 2018, a tumultuous year in which the state was in the national spotlight on two major story lines with long-term effects on Show Me politics.Some days, Missouri seemed like the Shock Me state. Beneath the daily roller coaster of Donald Trump’s presidency, Missouri had its ups, downs and era-defining twists and turns.Former Gov. Eric Greitens, a rocketing figure in Republican politics who, leading into 2018, was being mentioned as potential contender for higher national office, resigned amid allegations he’d had an extramarital affair and threatened his lover with a compromising photograph.

Like Trump, Greitens had campaigned for office against “career politicians” and political corruption. After his resignation, Greitens virtually disappeared from public life overnight. He was rarely seen or heard from for the rest of the year, and Missouri settled into a period of temporary normality under the new governor, the grandfatherly Mike Parson.In November, Republican Attorney General Josh Hawley, on as rapid of a rise as Greitens before Greitens’ fall, defeated incumbent Sen. Claire McCaskill, a two-term Democrat caught in the crosscurrents of national and state politics.McCaskill was a self-professed aspirant for the political center. Hawley is a conservative Trump ally who agreed with the president on virtually everything. Trump’s lingering popularity in Missouri and McCaskill’s voting record at major junctures, like Trump Supreme Court nominees, proved to be her undoing in a state that has increasingly moved right in the 21st century.The upshot: Missouri enhanced its Republican representation in Congress even as that body is freshly split down the middle. Hawley will join incumbent Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., in a 53-47 Republican majority in the United States Senate.Meanwhile, all eight of Missouri’s U.S. House members were re-elected. But the six Republicans in the delegation will now be part of a minority after the Democrats took control of the House with a gain of 40 seats on Nov. 8.Suddenly, Rep. William Lacy Clay, D-St. Louis, and Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, D-Kansas City, are thrust back into the majority, and their Democratic Party will control committees, investigative work, and the flow of legislation over the next two years, at least.
“Being in the majority in the House means everything,” Clay said.While the collapse of Greitens’ governorship was the result of alleged personal improprieties and political arrogance of his own doing, McCaskill’s electoral loss was primarily viewed as the result of trends that had moved beyond her reach.She had been elected in 2006 and re-elected in 2012 with essentially the same center-left political philosophy and voting record. She had been a survivor in a state that had not voted for a Democrat for president in the last five elections and eight of the last 10.
McCaskill’s defeat ended an era. As long as she was in office, and a recognizable national figure, Missouri Democrats could cling to the idea that Missouri was a state that could oscillate back and forth between parties in its top statewide elections. But since McCaskill was re-elected in 2012, Missouri Republicans have won every statewide race for president, senator and governor.The generational shift is significant. State Auditor Nicole Galloway is now the highest-ranking elected Democrat in Missouri. She is just 36, three years younger than Hawley, who will turn 39 on New Year’s Eve.McCaskill was 45 when she was first elected auditor in 1998. She used that as a springboard to the U.S. Senate eight years later, after losing a run for governor in 2004. Much attention will be on Galloway as the calendar moves toward the state’s 2020 gubernatorial election. Blunt, who turns 69 in January, is not up for re-election until 2022.The long-term impact of a third Missouri story line of 2018 — that of former Democratic Secretary of State Jason Kander — is harder to foresee. He had been considered a rising national star in a Democratic Party desperately seeking new faces, even though he had lost narrowly to Blunt in the 2016 Senate race.As 2018 began, Kander was traveling extensively around the country for a voting-rights political group he started. He got favorable media and activist attention in states that hold early presidential primaries and caucuses. But shortly after declaring he would run for mayor of Kansas City, Kander withdrew and announced he was getting treatment for depression.His service as an Army intelligence officer in Afghanistan had weighed harder on him than he’d admitted. He needed to get help, he said. Suddenly, his political ambitions didn’t seem as important as a quieter, healthier life in the moment. Maybe that’s the biggest takeaway from Missouri’s 2018 political year.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri weighing whether to build another nursing home for veterans,"Dec 27, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-weighing-whether-to-build-another-nursing-home-for-veterans/article_cd8a92e6-4ed1-547d-946a-e2ffcf1d45d9.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • A new state-run nursing home for military veterans could be on the horizon in Missouri.A review of state bidding documents shows the Missouri Veterans Commission is seeking a contractor to determine if the current fleet of seven homes for aging veterans is enough to meet demand in the coming decade.As an option, the contractor also could propose adding bed space to the state’s existing veterans’ homes in Bellefontaine Neighbors, Warrensburg, Mount Vernon, St. James, Cape Girardeau, Mexico and Cameron.

The study comes as Gov. Mike Parson recently cut the ribbon on $13 million in renovations to the Bellefontaine Neighbors home, including the conversion of rooms to all single-occupancy with private restrooms.The governor, a veteran, also made a stop this month at the Warrensburg home.In all, the commission manages a total of 1,350 beds across the state for long term skilled nursing care. In July, the commission reported there was a waiting list of 761 veterans seeking space in the facilities.
Bid documents show the contractor should estimate the number of veterans that will be eligible for nursing home care over the next 10, 20 and 30 years.The analysis also should determine where a new home should be located in order to reach the greatest number of veterans. Additionally, the contractor should propose sites within 90 miles of the facility in Bellefontaine Neighbors, located north of St. Louis.
Among the considerations that should be made are the availability of health care workers and other facilities that might compete with the available workforce, the documents note.The report will also outline projected costs of building a new facility and operational costs for the first five years.Veterans commission spokesman Daniel Bell said proposals are due in January.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Editorial: For Missouri, 2018 brought toppled politicos, jobs lost to trade wars, and vanishing data","Dec 26, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-for-missouri-brought-toppled-politicos-jobs-lost-to-trade/article_54dcdcde-a64a-52ce-ba22-4b8f5de0e3ef.html,"For Missouri, 2018 was a year of political exits that rocked the state and drew national attention. The year began with a sex-and-violence scandal that would ultimately take down Republican Gov. Eric Greitens. It ended with the defeat of two-term Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill, giving national Republicans one of their few bright spots in the midterms.In between, Missourians changed state labor and drug laws in some decidedly un-conservative ways. President Donald Trump’s trade wars hit some of his strongest Missouri supporters. Data-wiping technology was revealed to be in wide governmental use. And 17 people lost their lives when a tourist “duck boat” overturned in the Ozarks.Greitens, a charismatic ex-Navy SEAL and bestselling author, exploded onto the scene in 2016 to win the governor’s office. His brash populism echoed Trump’s, as did his chaotic governing style.

Long-swirling rumors of a lurid extramarital affair broke open in January. Greitens’ former hairdresser alleged that, during an encounter in his St. Louis home in 2015 in which she was bound and blindfolded, he snapped a picture of her and threatened to publicize it if she revealed their affair.Greitens issued an extraordinary statement Jan. 10 — hours after his second annual State of the State speech — acknowledging the affair but denying the rest. Later, the woman further accused Greitens of physical and sexual violence.The Legislature began talking impeachment. St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner filed criminal charges over the alleged photo threat and, later, over unrelated allegations of illegal campaign fundraising. Greitens defiantly vowed to fight the allegations.But on May 29, he abruptly announced — with a breaking voice — that he would resign, effective June 1. Gardner dropped the criminal charges. Lt. Gov. Mike Parson, Greitens’ level-headed polar opposite in every way but party affiliation, became governor.Greitens has since disappeared from public view, save one bizarre postscript: The man who was known for his infinite ambition, and whose books were all about never giving up, is rumored to be quietly raising money for a future run at office.McCaskill, on the other hand, says her name won’t appear on a ballot again, after losing her bid for a third Senate term on Nov. 6 to Republican state Attorney General Josh Hawley. It leaves Missouri, a former battleground state, with just one statewide Democrat: Auditor Nicole Galloway, who won her first full term in the same election.The combination of Greitens’ resignation and Hawley’s departure for the Senate set in motion a bizarre succession chain reaction. As of January, half of Missouri’s statewide elective offices will be filled by people who were never elected to those offices.
Hawley faced controversy over his decision, as attorney general, to join Missouri in a multistate lawsuit by Republicans seeking to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, threatening the health care coverage of a million or more Missourians. In response, Hawley put out a campaign ad vaguely claiming to be the true champion of universal coverage — an ad so obviously misleading that it drew national condemnation.Hawley nonetheless easily toppled McCaskill, furthering Missouri’s inexorable march in recent years toward solid red-state status.But even as Missourians elected conservative candidates this year, they approved policies at odds with the conservative agenda. In a ballot measure in August, they overwhelmingly defeated a Republican-passed law that had made Missouri an anti-union “right-to-work” state. Then ballot measures in November hiked the minimum wage and legalized medical marijuana.It was the first statewide general election to employ Missouri’s controversial voter ID law, created by legislative Republicans to solve the nonexistent problem of individual voter fraud. As expected, the requirements created confusion at polling places.
Amid the busy year of Missouri politics came a tragedy that stunned America. On the night of July 19, a duck boat set out on Table Rock Lake in the Ozarks near Branson, with 31 people aboard. The boat capsized and sank in high winds, killing 17 people ranging in age from 1 to 70. The dead included nine members of the Coleman family of Indianapolis. Multiple lawsuits, proposed safety legislation and manslaughter charges against the captain are pending.Trump’s trade wars this year tested the resolve of Americans who have provided his strongest political support, including the people of the southeastern Missouri.Mid Continent Nail Corp. of Poplar Bluff, America’s biggest producer of nails, gets its steel from the Mexican company that owns the factory. That steel now costs 25 percent more than it used to, thanks to Trump’s tariffs on Mexican imports. The factory this year shed more than a third of its workforce as it was priced out of the market. The company warns it could yet close completely.Missouri’s political class ended 2018 talking about a technology issue that has been humming all year: the cellphone app Confide, which automatically erases text messages after they’re exchanged. Then-Gov. Greitens and his staff were first caught last December using it for government business. Hawley, as attorney general, conducted a weak investigation of whether destroying records of official conversations in real time violated sunshine laws — a no-brainer, this newspaper has argued.It was later revealed that at least one person on Hawley’s staff was using Confide as well. More recently, it was revealed that the chief of staff of state Treasurer Eric Schmitt, Hawley’s soon-to-be-seated replacement as attorney general, also was using the disappearing app.Which makes it fair to ask, as 2018 draws to a close, whether there will be any government records left to report on by this time next year."
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Sinquefield writes $850,000 check to PAC supporting Missouri's governor","Dec 26, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/sinquefield-writes-check-to-pac-supporting-missouri-s-governor/article_b47ce807-630a-539b-85b1-14922999de23.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • One of Missouri’s most prolific campaign donors is signaling that he wants Gov. Mike Parson to run for a full term in 2020.Missouri Ethics Commission records show retired financier Rex Sinquefield wrote an $850,000 check on Dec. 22 to a political action committee formed to support the Republican governor.Parson, 63, was elected in 2016 as lieutenant governor, but was elevated to the top spot in state government on July 1 when former Gov. Eric Greitens resigned under a cloud of scandal.

Parson has not said whether he will seek a full four-year term, but he has not ruled it out.Former Missouri Republican Party Chairman John Hancock, who oversees the Uniting Missouri PAC, said the six-figure check from the St. Louis philanthropist was not a surprise even though Sinquefield had backed Parson’s opponent in the GOP primary for lieutenant governor two years ago.“My sense is that people are genuinely enthused about the governor,” Hancock said. ""We’re very grateful to have the support. Hopefully, it’s a sign of more good things to come.”Hancock also acknowledged that Parson hasn’t announced his plans for 2020.“As a good Boy Scout, you always want to be prepared,” he said.Contributions to the PAC come after Missouri voters endorsed separate constitutional amendments in 2016 and 2018 to cap campaign contributions.After having no limits on campaign donations to individual candidates, which created a class of mega-donors populated by Sinquefield and Joplin roofing magnate David Humphreys, the current cap for non-legislative candidates is $2,600 per election. But, that doesn’t limit what can be given to PACs.Hancock said the pro-Parson PAC will help him compete if he seeks a full, four-year term.
“Because of the finance law we face, it is important to have a fundraising mechanism like this. It’s also important to us that all fundraising and expenses are fully transparent,” Hancock said.During his turbulent 17 months in office, Greitens used the nonprofit group A New Missouri to promote his agenda.In contrast to Uniting Missouri, A New Missouri did not have to reveal its donors because of its nonprofit status with the Internal Revenue Service. That led to charges Greitens violated Missouri campaign finance law by intentionally concealing donors.
Tax records made public last week show A New Missouri raked in more than $6 million, but its donors remain secret.Although Sinquefield backed Bev Randles against Parson in the 2016 lieutenant governor election, the latest contribution is not his first to the governor.As a candidate for the state Senate, Parson received two $25,000 contributions from Sinquefield – one in 2009 and the other in 2012.The haul from Sinquefield is helping to push Uniting Missouri’s fundraising totals to the $2 million mark in less than six months.In the latest fundraising quarter, the PAC also reported contributions from cigarette companies, nursing home operators and others who are regulated or do business with state government.Other donations to Uniting Missouri include: $10,000 from Republic Services Inc., a waste-collection company whose properties include West Lake Landfill; $25,000 from St. Louis County-based Express Scripts; $20,000 from St. Louis-based Spire Missouri Inc.; $20,000 from Phoenix Home Care; and $10,000 from Wildwood-based Torch Electronics.“We’ve got a very aggressive fundraising plan that we’re executing,” Hancock said.

It has now become obvious that the Legislature thinks of the voters as a bunch of misinformed, ill-advised idiots.We passed a law outlawing open carry, and they reversed it. We passed a law against “puppy mills,” and they severely limited its effectiveness by removing the 50-dog limit.

Now we find out that the man who was largely responsible for removing that limit has another voter initiative in his sights. He feels that he knows better when it comes to these initiatives, and voters don’t really know what they’re talking about.
Well, it certainly appears the voters didn’t know what they were doing when they elected Parson, first to the Legislature and then as lieutenant governor, the position that made him the governor when Eric Greitens resigned. There is also talk of the Legislature finding a way to get around our recent vote against “right to work.”
Perhaps if we have a nonpartisan demographer work with the Legislature in setting the new district boundaries, as required by the initiative, we will get a Legislature that is not so anxious to overturn our vote.Rich Potvin  •  St. Louis"

Mike Parson rewrote an order issued by his predecessor, Eric Greitens, that had prohibited all gifts from lobbyists. The change was aimed at allowing groups to distribute informational booklets to employees of the state’s chief executive.In October, the libertarian-leaning Institute for Justice said the Greitens-era ban on gift-giving violated the organization’s First Amendment rights to free speech because it prohibits them from giving workers in Parson’s office two books.

In a court filing, Hawley’s office said the change makes the lawsuit unnecessary.“In short, Plaintiff’s challenge to Executive Order 17-02 is moot because Executive Order 17-02 is no longer Missouri law,” the motion notes.
For years, state lawmakers have been unable to agree on regulations that could end or put limits on freebies handed out by lobbyists.
In response, Greitens issued his original executive order on his first day in office in 2017.On Nov. 6, Missouri voters voted to impose limits on lawmakers receiving gifts. The $5 threshold for expenditures made by lobbyists, however, only applies to members of the House and Senate, not to members of the executive branch.An Institute for Justice attorney said last month that lawyers for the organization were reviewing Parson’s new order to determine if the change allows the group to distribute its books.“If so, it ends the case,” said attorney Paul Sherman.

Mike Parson is not an advocate for Medicaid expansion in Missouri despite research showing that states that did not expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act have seen more struggles in rural hospitals. Is Gov. Parson also going to ignore that Medicaid programs are taking the lead in identifying and tailoring strategies to prevent and treat opioid use disorder?The 2016 National Survey on Drug Use and Health reported that among non-elderly adults with opioid addiction, those with Medicaid were twice as likely as those with private insurance or no insurance to have received treatment. American families with private insurance are reluctant to seek care because private plans impose higher out-of-pocket costs or more stringent coverage limits. Due to high levels of stigma and discrimination, individuals with employer-sponsored coverage are not pursuing treatment because they worry that their employer will find out about their opioid use disorder.

Expanding Medicaid in Missouri won’t just help lower-income individuals. It can also help middle-class Americans have access to a medically needy program. Medically needy programs allow middle-class families to qualify for Medicaid if they have medical expenses that significantly reduce their income.
Many middle-class families are taking out second mortgages, emptying out 401(k)s, and going broke to pay for opioid treatment to save a son or daughter. Expanding Medicaid in Missouri will provide greater access to effective and affordable opioid treatment for all Missourians regardless of their income levels.

Eric Greitens leaves the podium after announcing his resignation in the governor's office on Tuesday, May 29, 2018 in Jefferson City. Photo by Robert Cohen, rcohen@post-dispatch.com


Robert Cohen • rohen@post-dispatch.com



On the night of Jan. 10, Gov. Eric Greitens stood before legislators in the Missouri House chamber and promised to unveil the “boldest state tax reform in America.” But something else was troubling him.Barely an hour later, KMOV-TV broadcast a report alleging the governor had taken a partly nude photo of a woman in 2015 and threatened to release it if she revealed their affair. Greitens and his wife, Sheena, issued a statement confirming the affair. His lawyer denied the blackmail allegation.

Less than five months later, Greitens resigned, calling himself the victim of “legal harassment.”Greitens, a native of Maryland Heights and a former Navy SEAL, burst into politics with a carefully choreographed campaign for governor in 2016 that featured lots of military-style gunfire and a grand promise to crush corruption. But his hypocrisy over campaign finance — he doggedly refused to identify many of his own donors after pledging to do otherwise — caused tension with the GOP legislative majority.An investigation by St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner, a Democrat, led to an indictment. A grand jury accused him of felony invasion of privacy for allegedly taking a nonconsensual cellphone photo of his partly clad lover. Greitens assembled a dream team of defense lawyers, including former federal prosecutors and a former St. Louis judge.  
Back at the capitol, a legislative committee took riveting testimony.Gardner bypassed St. Louis Police and hired William Don Tisaby, a former FBI agent, to do her investigative work. But they had to admit that the video recorder they used while questioning the woman had malfunctioned. Tisaby swore he took no notes. When an IT specialist recovered the video, it showed Tisaby with pen and pad. The dream team pounced, demanding to question Gardner under oath.
On May 14, three days into jury selection for Greitens' trial in St. Louis, Gardner dropped the charge after the judge ruled she had to testify about Tisaby, who already had taken the Fifth Amendment. Greitens was ecstatic.But numerous GOP legislators called for his impeachment and demanded information on his campaign finances. On the morning of May 29, a judge in Jefferson City ordered Greitens to hand over the records. That afternoon, he resigned.He was replaced by Lt. Gov. Mike Parson, an Ozarks farmer and former sheriff and legislator."
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Missouri officials have yet to decide on new cross-state hiking, biking trail","Dec 24, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/traffic/along-for-the-ride/missouri-officials-have-yet-to-decide-on-new-cross-state/article_654963fa-100f-5bc9-b776-65cf9f5f9426.html,"Two years after then-Gov. Jay Nixon announced plans to turn a 144-mile stretch of the old Rock Island rail line into a state biking-hiking trail, it’s still not known if current Missouri officials will follow through with the idea.The state parks division under Gov. Mike Parson faces a Feb. 21 federal deadline for deciding whether to accept the planned donation of the rail corridor by Ameren.At issue, parks officials say, is the potential cost of developing the corridor into something similar to the long-established Katy Trail and its effect on the state’s financial ability to operate its many existing parks.

“We don’t want to do anything to impact our stewardship of the facilities we have,” Mike Sutherland, a deputy state parks director, said Friday.Now, as the deadline fast approaches, a national nonprofit trails advocacy group is urging people to contact Parson and other state officials on behalf of the plan.“Missouri officials may pass up a once-in-a-generation opportunity” to preserve the corridor for future trail use, the Washington-based Rails-to-Trails Conservancy warns on its website.The conservancy’s effort follows similar lobby campaigns over the past two years by the Missouri Bicycle and Pedestrian Federation and Missouri Rock Island Trail Inc., a booster group for the trail.Supporters also include leaders in towns along the corridor, which would reach from Beaufort in Franklin County to Windsor in western Missouri.









Bolstered by a study done for the booster group by University of Missouri Extension, backers say the trail would boost tourism and provide an economic shot in the arm for the area.The Missouri Farm Bureau Federation, meanwhile, remains opposed and says the trail would disrupt nearby farms and lead to increased road and public safety expenses.State officials in 2017 said fully completing the trail could cost $65 million to $85 million. That was a preliminary estimate based on experience from 47.5 miles of trail opened in 2016 along a Rock Island segment west of Windsor.That’s now called the Rock Island spur of the Katy Trail. The Katy itself goes from St. Charles County through Windsor and further west.
Sutherland said a detailed study of the corridor’s condition carried out since then hadn’t changed the estimate.Among the state’s options are accepting just part of the corridor or working with private groups. “Anything’s an option potentially,” he said.Greg Harris, executive director of Missouri Rock Island Trail Inc., argues that the state need only make “the bare minimum” initial investment.
“They could leave it largely unchanged in the short term” while working with private organizations and towns along the corridor to gradually develop parts of the trail over many years, Harris said.Harris said it could be used at first in its current rough state for hiking, horseback riding and mountain biking — stopping and starting on either side of the route’s many bridges that require renovation work.Sutherland said that even if the corridor sat idle without improvements for many years, there would still be a significant cost to the state because it would have the responsibility of keeping it safe and monitoring it.He added that a bill passed by the Legislature this year could add to the expense.The measure requires the state parks system to maintain any fencing between land owned by private parties and any part of the corridor taken over by the state.If the state rejects the corridor, Harris said, his group will explore other options such as a private organization’s accepting the Ameren donation. But he said the state parks system was the logical entity to oversee it.The state’s reconsideration of the Ameren offer began under Eric Greitens, the Republican who succeeded Nixon, a Democrat, in January 2017. Parson, also a Republican, became governor when Greitens resigned last June. Ameren bought the corridor in 1999 through a subsidiary.The state won last year from the federal Surface Transportation Board a yearlong extension of the deadline for accepting the rail corridor.Sutherland said that although the parks agency was working to reach a decision by Feb. 21, it could request a further extension if officials determined additional time was needed."
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Editorial: Clergy abuse probe should be top priority for Missouri's next attorney general,"Dec 22, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-clergy-abuse-probe-should-be-top-priority-for-missouri/article_0dc0cebf-dd77-5517-aa78-375215c7bdcc.html,"An investigation by the Illinois attorney general into child sexual assault in the Catholic Church echoes what’s been found in other states: a widespread, decades-long pattern of abuse and coverup involving hundreds of priests.Missouri’s own investigation continues, with victims’ advocates complaining that outgoing Attorney General Josh Hawley hasn’t been aggressive enough. With Hawley heading to the U.S. Senate, his replacement, Eric Schmitt, has an opportunity to start on the right foot by making the investigation a top priority.America was stunned this year when an investigation in Pennsylvania determined that some 300 priests had abused roughly 1,000 children over a 70-year period, as the church actively covered the abusers’ tracks. Those findings spawned similar investigations in other states, including Missouri and Illinois.

Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan announced her office’s findings last week, and it was, again, stunning. As the Post-Dispatch’s Nassim Benchaabane reported, Madigan’s investigators uncovered allegations of sexual abuse against at least 500 clergy that the church knew about but never made public.In many cases, they found, the church declined to even investigate allegations. Some abuse survivors weren’t told that others had been victimized by the same clergy members. There were also instances in which church officials used details of the victims’ personal lives to discredit them.
In a statement, Madigan aptly laid out the scope of this betrayal, saying the church “has failed in its moral obligation to provide survivors, parishioners and the public a complete and accurate accounting of all sexually inappropriate behavior involving priests in Illinois.”
In Missouri, Hawley announced his office’s own investigation in August, shortly after the Pennsylvania report broke. Hawley — who heads to Washington in January — has faced criticism from victims’ advocates who say the attorney general has not pursued the investigation aggressively. Hawley has disputed that.Part of the challenge with the Missouri investigation is that the attorney general’s office has no subpoena power over church entities here; that rests with local prosecutors. Hawley’s investigation from the outset has relied on voluntary cooperation from the church, an approach victims’ advocates don’t believe will work.Schmitt, the current state treasurer whom Gov. Mike Parson appointed to fill Hawley’s vacancy, will inherit that problem along with the rest of the investigation. There are ways around it, including a coordinated effort to get local prosecutors involved in the probe. He also could seek the appointment of the attorney general’s office as a special prosecutor, which would give it subpoena power.As Schmitt prepares to assume this investigation, he should explore those and other options available to make this an aggressive, full-fledged investigation like those conducted in Pennsylvania and, now, Illinois. Relying on the cooperation of a church hierarchy that was complicit in the coverup for generations is unacceptable."
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"With revenues `horrible,' Missouri heading into budget talks with newcomers at the helm","Dec 21, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/with-revenues-horrible-missouri-heading-into-budget-talks-with-newcomers/article_6af1b62e-84d4-51c3-aaa8-ac1bfe14b426.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • At a time when Missouri’s tax collections are being described as “horrible,” the Legislature is launching next year’s session with newcomers at the helm of the House and Senate budget-writing committees.Gov. Mike Parson’s appointment on Wednesday of Rep. Scott Fitzpatrick to be the next state treasurer marked the latest change in the makeup of the team that will decide how the state spends more than $28 billion next year on everything from prisons to parks.Fitzpatrick, R-Cassville, served as chairman of the House Budget Committee, steering the 163-member chamber on appropriations issues for the past two years.

On Friday, Rep. Elijah Haahr, R-Springfield, who is in his first term as speaker of the House, announced that Rep. Cody Smith, R-Jasper, would be Fitzpatrick’s replacement.Smith has served as vice chairman of the panel since June.“Having served the past months as the vice chairman and preparing for the session, he is ready to tackle the complexities of the budget process and provide stability on the committee for years to come,” Haahr said.The Senate also has a new appropriations chief.Sen. Dan Hegeman, R-Cosby, takes over for Sen. Dan Brown, R-Rolla, who is departing because of term limits.Hegeman served 11 years as a state representative and was a member of the budget committee during that time. He has served on the Senate Appropriations Committee for two years.Sen. Mike Cunningham, R-Rogersville, said he didn’t believe there would be any hiccups because of the lack of experience leading the two committees.“I don’t foresee any problem,” Cunningham said. “Dan Hegeman has been around for a while. He’ll do fine. And the governor is going to do a good job presenting us with a budget plan.”Haahr also expressed confidence in Smith, who was elected to his second term in November.
“Passing a balanced budget is the most important responsibility of the Missouri General Assembly, and I am confident in Rep. Smith’s ability to ensure every tax dollar spent reflects the priorities of Missourians,” he said.But the legislative changes come as state revenues are in flux.State Budget Director Dan Haug announced earlier this month that net general revenue collections for November 2018 decreased 9.1 percent compared with those for November 2017, to $676.5 million this year from $743.8 million last year.General revenue collections for 2018 fiscal year-to-date decreased 4.9 percent compared with November 2017, to $3.44 billion this year from $3.62 billion last year.
That set off alarm bells for the director of the Senate appropriations office.“When comparing the month of November to November of last fiscal year, (general revenue) collections were horrible. The numbers continue to be of concern especially with the continued negative decline in individual income tax collections, which is the largest revenue source in terms of GR collections for the state,” Adam Koenigsfeld wrote in a Dec. 5 memo obtained by the Post-Dispatch.Koenigsfeld’s sentiment represents a big turnaround from just five months ago, when the state ended the fiscal year with a surplus of $350 million, allowing the state’s new governor to avoid having to make any spending cuts.In order for the state to hit its targets, tax collections will need to grow by 2.2 percent for the rest of the fiscal year, which ends June 30, he said.That may be possible. Typically, more than 50 percent of the state’s revenue flows in during the second half of the fiscal year, when people file their tax returns.But officials also will be dealing with the fallout from federal and state tax cuts.Beginning Jan. 1, the income tax rate paid by most Missourians will drop to 5.4 percent from 5.9 percent. Supporters of the decrease say the elimination of a number of tax exemptions could reduce the impact of lower tax rates.The 2019 legislative session begins Jan. 9 and runs through May 17.

Eric Greitens raised almost $6.1 million from secret donors in 2017, the year the political outsider took office and rattled the capital city’s establishment, new tax filings show.The IRS Form 990 for filing year 2017 — filed Monday and first reported Wednesday by the group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington — offers the most detailed look to date of A New Missouri, the 501(c)(4) nonprofit that operated opaquely during Greitens’ abbreviated tenure. Greitens resigned June 1.The filing confirms that A New Missouri received enough money in 2017 to rival the campaign accounts of serious statewide contenders. It shows that money flowed to firms tied to Greitens and his campaign — reinforcing concern over close ties between Greitens’ campaign and the nonprofit.

Unlike a traditional state campaign committee, A New Missouri was able to accept unlimited campaign donations and shield its donors from disclosure.In July, at the culmination of a months-long Missouri House investigation into Greitens’ campaign apparatus, Rep. Jay Barnes, R-Jefferson City, wrote in a complaint to the Missouri Ethics Commission that A New Missouri was formed to evade state campaign contribution limits and donor disclosure requirements.Indeed, the 67 donations recorded in the 990 filing all exceed $2,600 — the cap voters placed on individual donations to candidates in the 2016 election.The Post-Dispatch reported last week that Michael Hafner, who worked on Greitens’ campaign, said he spoke with the Missouri Ethics Commission in November about Barnes’ complaint, suggesting the commission is still investigating.Hafner testified to the Missouri House last spring that, when he worked on the campaign, he spoke with California venture capitalist Monu Joseph about ways to conceal political donations. Joseph is listed as the president of A New Missouri in the tax filing.According to the new tax filing, A New Missouri received two donations of $1 million each, with the rest of the donations ranging from $5,000 to $600,000. A New Missouri does not reveal the date of any of the donations nor the identity of any donors.The filing also shows that Target Enterprises, a firm tied to White House official Nick Ayers, received more than $1.7 million from A New Missouri last year.Ayers’ political consulting firm, C5 Creative Consulting, was paid $184,143 last year. The firm, which Ayers protégé and Greitens’ campaign manager Austin Chambers worked for, closed in April.Other payments went to South Carolina-based Something Else Strategies, California-based Bask Digital Media and Virginia-based the Tarrance Group.All five firms also were paid by Greitens for Missouri, Greitens’ traditional campaign committee.In the run-up to the 2016 election, Greitens’ campaign fund doled out more than $902,000 to Something Else Strategies for video production services. Among the work done by the company was the television ad showing a T-shirt clad Greitens firing a machine gun.Greitens also paid the Tarrance Group more than $350,000, according to 2016 campaign records. The Alexandria, Va.-based firm did most of the polling in Greitens’ race against Democrat Chris Koster.
In his 2016 run, Greitens’ campaign paid Bask Digital Media more than $100,000, according to filings with the Missouri Ethics Commission.A New Missouri also sunk $1.5 million into a campaign to keep right-to-work legislation law. The form notes donations to Freedom to Work and Missourians for Worker Freedom.Meredith Gibbons, A New Missouri’s fundraiser, was paid $140,000 for her efforts, according to the tax filing. Gibbons also worked on Greitens’ campaign. A New Missouri paid $47,126 to a law firm owned by Michael Adams, who is listed as treasurer of the group.It is not uncommon for governors throughout the nation to use similar dark money groups.According to a June report by CREW, more than a third of governors holding office as of Jan. 31, 2017, can be linked to 501(c)(4) groups.
Of those, 70 percent did not voluntarily disclose their donors to the public, the report noted.Greitens’ replacement, Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican, does not have a dark money group. Rather, a political action committee known as Uniting Missouri has been formed on his behalf. Donors, who have contributed more than $750,000 this year, are publicly disclosed.It is unclear how active A New Missouri is now that Greitens is out of office.The Washington-based attorney for A New Missouri, Adams, was traveling for the Christmas break and could not immediately be reached for comment.Robin Simpson, a member of the organization’s board, also could not be reached for comment. Simpson, of Monroe City, Mo., was a vocal supporter of Greitens during his 2016 campaign, and he appointed her to the Missouri Lottery Commission after he took office.Chambers, a Georgia-based political consultant who worked with A New Missouri and managed the Greitens campaign, did not respond to a request for information.When Greitens left the Capitol for the final time, the organization shared an office with his campaign fund, which has mostly stopped raising money.According to the most recent filing, the Greitens for Missouri fund raised $32 in the most recent fundraising quarter. After paying off legal bills, the fund had $891,000 on hand as of October 1.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Parson picks House budget chief to be next Missouri Treasurer,"Dec 19, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/parson-picks-house-budget-chief-to-be-next-missouri-treasurer/article_4b840ab7-da3e-5a9d-9649-e7c17a59fcf9.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • A shake-up of state government triggered by the departure of former Gov. Eric Greitens in June continued Wednesday after Republican Gov. Mike Parson appointed a lawmaker from southwestern Missouri as the next state treasurer.Rep. Scott Fitzpatrick, R-Cassville, will take over in January when current Treasurer Eric Schmitt officially becomes attorney general.Although the latest shuffling of statewide elected officials is because of the vacancy created by Attorney General Josh Hawley’s election to the U.S. Senate in November, the overhaul began in June when the scandal-plagued Greitens resigned and was replaced by Parson, who was lieutenant governor at the time.

Along with using his power to name Schmitt and Fitzpatrick to new jobs, Parson also appointed former Sen. Mike Kehoe, R-Jefferson City, as his successor as lieutenant governor.Fitzpatrick’s pending appointment means that only two of Missouri’s statewide elected officers — Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft, a Republican, and Auditor Nicole Galloway, a Democrat — were chosen to do their jobs by voters.“Scott has built his career, as a small business owner and legislator, with a proven track record of being a wise steward and protector of the people’s money,” Parson said. “From the beginning of this administration, it has been a top priority that we strive to provide stability and instill confidence for all Missourians — that we can and will move forward.”Fitzpatrick, 31, will leave his post as chairman of the House Budget Committee, which is among the most powerful positions in state government.As chairman, he has overseen the crafting of the state’s $28 billion spending blueprint for the past two years. The most recent budget boosts spending on kindergarten through grade 12 schools by nearly $99 million and boosts state aid for school transportation costs by $10 million.
The budget also rejected a plan by Greitens to cut state aid to universities by $68 million and includes $700-a-year pay raises for state workers and an extra $350 on top of that for workers at the Department of Corrections.“As house budget chairman, I’ve worked to protect Missouri taxpayers by passing balanced budgets that eliminate wasteful spending while investing in our shared priorities. As state treasurer, I’ll continue to work each and every day to promote government transparency and efficiency,” Fitzpatrick said.
First elected to the House in 2012, Fitzpatrick represents Barry and portions of Stone and Lawrence counties.Other dutiesFitzpatrick is the CEO of MariCorp US., a marine manufacturing and construction company based in Shell Knob, Mo. He and his wife, Mallory, have twin sons, Luke and Carson, age 3.Fitzpatrick also is on the board of the Missouri State Employees Retirement System, which oversees pension plans for more than 115,000 current and former state workers.Fitzpatrick was among a handful of Republican lawmakers who were vetted for the $107,746-a-year position, including state Reps. Shamed Dogan of Ballwin, Holly Rehder of Sikeston and Jean Evans of Manchester.The Legislative Black Caucus lobbied Parson to appoint Dogan, who is the Legislature’s lone black Republican.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri governor wants law for online sales tax collections,"Dec 18, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/business/local/missouri-governor-wants-law-for-online-sales-tax-collections/article_b2e152bd-12f1-5176-a6d8-2b98fff39542.html,"Missouri Gov. Mike Parson said Tuesday that he wants to enact a law enabling the state to collect millions of dollars of new tax revenue from out-of-state retailers who sell things to Missouri residents.The new online sales tax provision will be part of Parson's agenda for the legislative session that starts Jan. 9, the governor said in an interview with The Associated Press.Though there is no definitive plan yet for the potential new revenue, it could help propel other aspects of Parson's agenda to boost infrastructure funding and workforce development.

The U.S. Supreme Court opened the door for states to rake in greater online sales tax collections in a June ruling that upheld a South Dakota law. That decision overturned a decades-old precedent stating that businesses without a physical presence in a state — such as a store, office or warehouse — didn't have to collect sales taxes on behalf of the state. In such cases, customers technically were responsible for paying the tax, but most didn't.As online commerce has grown, some large retailers such as Amazon already had begun collecting sales taxes for all 45 states that charge them. But others with a physical presence in only a few places haven't been doing so.""If we're going to compete with internet sales, it sure ought to be fair with the brick and mortar businesses that are here,"" Parson told the AP. ""I think we should collect that, and I think we will eventually collect that.""Parson said a state law enabling online sales tax collections could generate between $100 million and $150 million annually for the state, though he emphasized those are only estimates.Missouri charges a 4.225 percent sales tax. But counties, cities, fire and ambulance districts and various other local jurisdictions tack on their own sales taxes. The total sales tax rates reach as high as 11.679 percent in some St. Louis community and transportation development districts.A tax table available from the Missouri Department of Revenue shows about 2,350 different sales tax rates in Missouri, making it complicated for retailers who sell products throughout the state.
At least 29 other states have already implemented laws to collect sales taxes from remote retailers or will be doing so in January or February, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.Parson said it remains to be decided what to do with the additional revenue Missouri would receive.But he noted his main goals as governor are workforce development and infrastructure, and he said the state needs to come up with a new funding stream for transportation after voters in November defeated a proposed 10-cent-a-gallon increase in the gas tax.
Parson said bonding also is a potential source of more money for infrastructure projects that could include roads and bridges, river ports and airports, and utility and high-speed internet systems.Some states also have been looking to generate new revenue from sports betting after New Jersey won a U.S. Supreme Court case in May that cleared the way for widespread legalized sports gambling.Parson said he expects the Legislature to address the issue and will review any bill that passes.But ""I'm not going to be promoting sports betting. It's not a priority of mine,"" Parson said.""On the personal side of me, it's probably one of those things I'm not sure is the greatest thing to do,"" Parson added. But ""as the governor of the state of Missouri, I think the people have got to decide that.""

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Horrigan: Probe-o-rama,"Dec 15, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/columnists/horrigan-probe-o-rama/article_59290927-3aa0-5481-88ce-de162ab0f01f.html,"If there’s one thing we Missouri Republicans are good at, apart from winning elections, it’s investigating ourselves.Winning elections is the easy part. The state is 82 percent white, and half of that 82 percent are evangelical voters. We’ve got a guy in the Legislature who videoed himself lopping the heads off chickens to make a point about abortion and he won re-election by 48 points. We’re easy.The investigations are the hard part. It’s a tricky balance: You have to appear to be concerned about a fellow Republican’s transgressions without actually doing anything about it, unless he’s Eric Greitens, who referred to you as vultures, liars and sociopaths. Him you chase like Jean Valjean.

(Speaking of Greitens: Outside of people in the witness protection program, has anyone ever dropped out of sight more thoroughly than the former governor and pull-up coach? For five months he’s on the front page every day and then poof! He’s gone. It’s like he moved to Abbottabad.)During Greitens’ legal troubles last spring, the Republican-led House conducted an actual, legitimate pre-impeachment investigation. The findings became moot when Greitens resigned June 1 and prosecutors dropped their cases against him. However, several investigations that Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley was conducting into his fellow Republican’s alleged transgressions are supposedly alive-ish.Hawley held press conferences and sprinkled subpoenas like confetti and used words like “impeachable offense.” It got him a lot of good publicity as he prepared to run for the U.S. Senate. It put some distance between himself and Greitens. But how serious the effort was is a matter of some dispute. His office’s first whack at finding out if Greitens’ staff had used Confide, a text-message zapping phone app, was limited to asking Greitens’ staffers whatever questions could be squeezed into a 15-minute interview.“Did you use Confide?”Yup.“Do anything wrong?”Nope.“OK. Good to go.”Now it’s Hawley who’s being investigated by yet another Republican state office holder, and there are signs that this investigation will be equally hard-hitting.
The Missouri secretary of state’s office is going to look into charges that Hawley allowed political consultants for his U.S. Senate campaign to direct the work of his state-paid workers in the attorney general’s office. The Kansas City Star broke the story, complete with a paper trail that clearly showed the consultants making decisions that turned state workers into campaign drones.I am of two minds about this. One, it’s illegal and people have gone to prison for similar crimes back when we took such matters seriously. Lest we forget, Hawley even made noise about investigating Greitens for using state resources for political purposes.Probably a special prosecutor should be looking into this, not Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft. He only has authority over election laws and doesn’t even have subpoena powers.On the other hand, Hawley’s office was such a mess in his brief tenure there that it’s good to know that someone was in charge, even if it was an illegal someone. The New York Times reported that lawyers came and went, mostly went, leaving the office’s civil litigation section badly understaffed and outmatched, costing the state a lot of money. Experienced litigators — the people who stand up in court and argue — quit willy-nilly. Hawley was busy running for Senate, and we Republicans were happy to elect him. We don’t care if the people we elect are good at their jobs — look who we elected as president.
But now a liberal legal group has complained about the role that consultants played in running the AG’s office. Ashcroft is going to investigate another Republican. Grudgingly.“This office will commence an investigation into the alleged offense,” Ashcroft’s deputy counsel wrote to the legal group, asking the group to pass along any information it might have.Some investigation this is going to be. Got any tips? Any ideas where we should look? Last week the office asked state Auditor Nicole Galloway if it can borrow her office’s subpoena power. This could be a problem. Galloway is not only a Democrat but doesn’t mess around.As if this cake needed any more icing, it turns out that while Hawley was “investigating” Greitens’ staff for using Confide, his own chief of staff was zapping public records with Confide. So was the chief of staff for state Treasurer Eric Schmitt, who will become attorney general whenever Hawley steps down.I’m thinking that as soon as he takes office, Schmitt ought to investigate Ashcroft for something. Nepotism, maybe. Then the new treasurer, whoever that turns out to be, can investigate Mike Kehoe, the new lieutenant governor that the old lieutenant governor, Mike Parson, appointed after he succeeded Greitens, even though he didn’t have clear authority to do so.And people wonder why Missouri is stuck in the mud.Kevin Horrigan, a retired member of the Post-Dispatch editorial board, is a freelance writer in St. Louis.kfhorrigan@gmail.com"
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Who is St. Louis' competition in its bid for a Major League Soccer team?,"Dec 15, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/sports/soccer/who-is-st-louis-competition-in-its-bid-for-a/article_06a66e35-bfba-5b76-8703-f5763e6ce21f.html,"NEW YORK • St. Louis’ bid to win a Major League Soccer team next year hinges as much on the merits of its competitors as on its own success.This contest won’t be decided by goals and teams, but by dollars and stadiums.Last week, club owners and officials praised St. Louis’ bid for an expansion franchise, impressed with the city’s love for soccer and the wealth of the proposed owners.

But history has proved, in sport after sport, team after team, that favorites don’t always stay favorites. Major League Soccer has demoted cities before, after plans changed.“There is significant competition for future Major League Soccer expansion,” cautioned Dan Courtemanche, a league executive vice president, at the owners’ December meeting last week.RELATED: See how St. Louis stacks up against the competitionTwenty-three teams played this year. New franchisees will open in Cincinnati next year, followed by Miami and Nashville in 2020. League Commissioner Don Garber has long targeted 28 teams as a “fully expanded” league. Despite recent discussion to move past 28, there’s little indication that would happen right away.One of those two spots is already gone: Garber said earlier this month that Anthony Precourt, owner of the Columbus Crew, will build the league’s 27th team in the hipster, high-tech mecca of Austin, Texas, and sell the Crew.That leaves room for expansion to just one city — and proposals from at least eight: Charlotte, N.C.; Detroit; Las Vegas; Phoenix; Raleigh, N.C.; Sacramento, Calif.; San Diego; and St. Louis.Owners and league officials have said repeatedly that the St. Louis bid — from World Wide Technology chief executive Jim Kavanaugh and Enterprise Holdings’ Taylor family — is a favorite.Kavanaugh briefly played professional soccer and owns the minor-league St. Louis Football Club. The Taylors bring a multibillion dollar bank account and a deep commitment to St. Louis. Their plans have recently won support from Missouri Gov. Mike Parson and St. Louis aldermen, two entities that dogged last year’s failed St. Louis bid for a team. And the ownership group has promised to pay out-of-pocket for a $250 million stadium on Market Street downtown.“St. Louis is a great market,” said Los Angeles Galaxy President Chris Klein, a St. Louis native and former De Smet soccer star. “And one I think Major League Soccer should be in.”The competitionBut frontrunners don’t always stay that way. Just a few years ago, a group of National Football League owners repeatedly praised the St. Louis effort to build a new football stadium and keep Stan Kroenke’s Rams in the city. The NFL’s expansion committee even recommended the team stay put. Then owners, swayed by the allure of Kroenke’s money and the grandeur of his vision, voted to send the Rams to Los Angeles.The current list of MLS expansion proposals is not fixed. League officials mention some on one day, and others on another. Garber has stopped naming them altogether, so as to avoid the complaints when he forgets one.But some of the eight cities have clearly moved down the list, if only temporarily.Garber, for instance, has publicly suggested that Charlotte and Raleigh aren’t in the running for this round of expansion. In September, he spoke to reporters about the success of clubs in Atlanta and Orlando, Fla., and franchises to come in Miami and Nashville. “I think we’re probably done expanding in the southeast for a little while,” he said.Sacramento, Calif., has a rabid soccer culture, the active support of city politicians, public money for a stadium, and a site picked out. But it doesn’t have a wealthy owner to woo the league.San Diego has a strong owners group and a growing, affluent region full of adults who grew up playing the sport — but voters there just turned down a plan to use city land for a new soccer stadium.Las Vegas, now a darling of professional sports teams, is an easy target. But Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman said a year ago that a Major League Soccer proposal was a few years away. And there are no public plans to attract a soccer team next year.
Two serious competitors remain, and they have some key advantages over St. Louis.‘We check a pretty big box’In November last year, the William Clay Ford family, which owns the NFL’s Detroit Lions, joined Detroit Pistons owner Tom Gores and Cleveland Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert on a Motor City bid, beefing up an already star-studded application. A month later, they pitched their plan to the league expansion committee. The league loves the size of the metropolitan area — at 4.3 million, it’s double that of Austin. And its urban core is rapidly rebounding.But by May of this year, the Detroit group had dumped plans to build a soccer-specific, open-air stadium — a feature the league dearly loves. Instead, they said the new team would play at the Ford Field dome, home of the Lions. That month, Garber publicly said Detroit was no longer a front-runner. And in September this year, the Detroit owners wrote a letter to league brass saying they wouldn’t retrofit Ford Field’s roof with a retractable top, either.Detroit is now working hard to make the dome suitable. They’ve pitched a multimillion dollar renovation to accommodate soccer. And MLS success at the football stadium in Atlanta, which has drawn crowds exceeding 70,000 to some games, has softened the league’s opinion.Detroit bid spokesman Kevin Grigg said “open dialogue” with the league continued regarding Ford Field.
Officials say Phoenix, too, is appealing.The metropolitan area is the 11th-largest in the U.S., with a population of 4.7 million and double-digit growth over the decade. Moreover, the closest Major League Soccer teams are in Los Angeles, 370 miles away. A team in Phoenix would fill a Southwest hole, in a sports-crazy town.“This is arguably one of the most vibrant if not competitive sports markets in the country,” said Ray Artigue, a sports marketing consultant and former director of the sports business program at Arizona State University.The bid has a built-in fan base. The minor league team Phoenix Rising is one of the more popular in the United Soccer League. And the ownership group, headed by Rising owner and restaurant chain chairman Berke Bakay, have added power investors, including international soccer star Didier Drogba, the musician Diplo, and in February, Chinese hotel magnate and billionaire Alex Zheng.“We check a pretty big box,” said Bobby Dulle, Rising’s general manager.There are drawbacks to Phoenix. The group has pitched an open-air stadium, despite the desert heat. They say they’ll have giant fans and misters and water walls to cool the breeze.Indeed, a 112-degree day in July still drew a sold-out 7,500 to a Rising game — but would that work for the tens of thousands needed to fill out an MLS stadium?“Phoenicians are used to it,” Dulle said.Meanwhile, St. Louis’ bid is getting deeper into the details. The group is speaking with architects, hammering out tax incentives, lining up corporate support and getting ready to present to owners, when called upon.But anything could happen, cautioned Patrick Rishe, director of the sports business program at Washington University. Remember last year, when St. Louis thought its chances were dead?“The Taylors changed everything,” Rishe said.Who knows what will surprise us in Sacramento, he said, or San Diego, or Phoenix.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"St. Louis hailed as 'great soccer city,' but MLS vote on expansion is a ways off","Dec 14, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/sports/soccer/st-louis-hailed-as-great-soccer-city-but-mls-vote/article_c2b23429-904a-5854-93a3-69c1f574c76b.html,"NEW YORK • Major League Soccer team owners discussed several competing expansion proposals on Thursday and came away with a glowing impression of the St. Louis bid, owners and league officials said.“You’ve got a great city, a great soccer city,” said Bill McGuire, owner of Minnesota United FC and a member of the league’s expansion committee. “And a great group of owners.”“It’s a good group,” said Cliff Illig, owner of Sporting Kansas City, which is poised to gain a rival if St. Louis gets picked. “I’m impressed.”

Still, a vote by the owners is a ways off, said owners and league officials who gathered in New York on Thursday for the league’s December meeting. At least a half-dozen cities are competing to win two coveted franchises. League Commissioner Don Garber said recently that picking expansion cities and growing the 26-team league to 28 could take as long as another year.The league has not publicly described the process yet. Several owners uniformly declined further comment on Thursday.But details are beginning to come out.The St. Louis ownership group, made up of World Wide Technology chief executive Jim Kavanaugh and Enterprise Holdings’ Taylor family, presented its plans to league officials in September.The next step for the group will land it in front of the league expansion committee, which the league is reorganizing now. Jonathan Kraft, president of the National Football League’s New England Patriots and owner of the New England Revolution, has served as chairman. Chicago Fire’s Andrew Hauptman, the Seattle Sounders’ Joe Roth and Philadelphia Union’s Jay Sugarman, plus Illig and McGuire, have recently served with Kraft.The expansion committee has, in the past, recommended finalists who then present to the full league ownership. It also has picked recent team winners Nashville and Cincinnati.The St. Louis ownership group did not attend Thursday’s meeting.But league executives and owners continued on Thursday to call St. Louis’ bid a front-runner.Kavanaugh briefly played professional soccer and owns the minor-league St. Louis Football Club. The Taylors bring a net worth that has been reported as high as $13.8 billion and a deep commitment to St. Louis. Their plans have recently won support from Missouri Gov. Mike Parson and St. Louis aldermen, two entities that dogged last year’s failed bid for a team. And the ownership group has promised to pay out-of-pocket for a $250 million stadium on Market Street downtown.Still, it’s unclear whether owners think St. Louis gives the league the best chance to succeed.
The league now has 23 teams, with three others — Cincinnati, Nashville and Miami — approved and set to start playing by 2020.Garber has in recent weeks said publicly that Austin, Texas, has the greenlight to start a team.That likely leaves at least six other cities — Charlotte, Detroit, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Raleigh and San Diego — vying for one last spot, not two.A league official confirmed on Thursday that Sacramento, Calif., also has an active bid.Carl Lindner, owner of the new Cincinnati franchise, wouldn’t say on Thursday which city he favors. Still, he had a message for St. Louis:
“St. Louis is one of the great Midwestern cities,” he said.“Hang in there.”

Soccer in St. Louis has a rich history


Five St. Louis players were on team that defeated England in 1950 World Cup

A St. Louisan was the keeper for the 1950 match against England in Brazil, holding a blank slate against the side considered to be the best in the world. Frank Borghi, who died in 2015, was one of five St. Louisans on the team that beat England 1-0.He made a key save in the second half on a header, knocking it wide of the net. “I was lucky to jump in the air and deflect it with my right hand,” he said in a 2009 interview.Brazil's fans, ecstatic to see their main rival lose, carried Borghi off the field on their shoulders. “I didn’t know what they were doing at first,” he said later. “I was kind of nervous. They picked me up and carried me 110 yards to the dugout. It was kind of exciting.”In addition to Borghi, Harry Keough, Gino Pariani, Frank (Peewee) Wallace and Charley Colombo were the St. Louisans on the field for that historic win over England. (Also on the team from St. Louis were Bob Annis, a reserve who didn’t play, and assistant coach William “Chubby” Lyons.) Keough died in 2012, Pariani in 2007, Colombo in 1986 and Wallace in 1979.

In 1995, a local team won a professional soccer title














FILE PHOTO APRIL, 1995 -- Kansas City's #14 Lee Tschantret is knocked down by the Ambush's #6 Steve Maurer as they pursue a loose ball.


KEVIN MANNING


On April 25, 1995, the Ambush staged a comeback to sweep the Harrisburg Heat in four games to become the only team in St. Louis professional soccer to win a title.The title was won three years after Dr. Abraham Hawatmeh brought the Tulsa Ambush to St. Louis. With the NHL locked out in 1994, the Ambush had the honor of playing the first regular-season game at the new Kiel Center (now the Enterprise Center).The team would lead the league in attendance that season, averaging 7,881 a game.The Ambush folded in 2000; a team with the same name now plays in the Major Arena Soccer League. The area has a men's team, St. Louis FC, in the USL Championship, a league one step below the top professional level, Major League Soccer. A team in the failed Women's Professional Soccer league, St. Louis Athletica, didn't win a championship in its short-lived tenure. Other now-defunct professional soccer teams include: Steamers (Major Indoor Soccer League), Storm (MISL), and Steamers (World Indoor Soccer League/MISL).

The last top-level men's professional soccer team was the Stars
The St. Louis Stars were a team in the North American Soccer League, which was the top-level pro league from 1968 to 1984. The Stars played from the start of the league until 1977, when the team moved to California. Well-known national players were on the team, including Al Trost. (He taught at McCluer North High during the offseason.) Other well-known players included Pat McBride and English goalie Peter Bonetti.The team wanted a better home field than Washington University's Francis Field (which had a 10,000-person capacity), and had trouble getting Busch Stadium for more than a few games during their season.For the 1977 season, the team drew an average of 9,111 fans, but that included a crowd of more than 32,000 at Busch Stadium (the game featured Pelé).Robert R. Hermann was one of the owners of the team. 

Several local teams were once best in the nation
Several St. Louis teams have won the National Challenge Cup, now known as the U.S. Open Cup. The tournament matches soccer teams from various levels, including Major League Soccer teams, in a single-elimination tournament to decide the best soccer team in the country. In May 1920, in what the St. Louis Star described as ""the greatest soccer game ever witnessed on any American field,"" the Ben Millers, a St. Louis team, beat a Massachusetts team to win the title.More than 10,000 people watched the game at Federal League Park, a stadium near the current St. Louis University campus. The St. Louis team was the first outside the East coast to win the title.Many of the teams in the early decades were owned by companies, hence the familiar names.Other St. Louis teams went on to play, and win, the Challenge Cup, including:• Scullin Steel: 1922 (The team went to the finals again in 1923, but had to forfeit a replay after a tie.)• Stix, Baer and Fuller: 1933, 1934• Central Breweries: 1935• Simpkins-Ford: 1948, 1950• Kutis: 1957, 1986 • Busch: 1988

European clubs used to come here to play against local teams
From the 1930s through '70s, St. Louis was a regular stop for foreign clubs making American tours. There were no professional American leagues, so teams played top amateur clubs.Over the years, clubs came from: Canada, Mexico, England, Chile, Germany, Brazil, Czechoslovakia, Sweden, Scotland, France and Turkey, among others. Manchester United came twice, in 1950 and 1960, playing matches at old Public Schools Stadium. The St. Louis teams almost always lost, though there was a 1-1 tie with Liverpool in 1964.The games may have been regular events, but that didn’t mean they weren’t special.“It was fun playing against (those teams),” said Bob Kehoe, a defender who took part in several of them in his long career. “They were almost always better than we were. We’re fledglings, newcomers to the game and they’ve been playing for hundreds of years. We were rarely, if ever, successful. But we’d learn from them, pick up nuances, say, ‘I never saw a team do that before.’ It was enjoyable, even if you got embarrassed.”Manchester City played a team of CYC All-Stars in St. Louis in 1958, in front of about 4,000 people. The teams played at the Public Schools Stadium. ""As expected, the all-professional English League team won the match, by a score of 6-2,"" read the Post-Dispatch article. ""The St. Louis players, all amateurs, were delighted to have held the First Division team to a 1-1 score at half time and to have escaped with only six goals charged against them, one of those a penalty kick.""

The Billikens men's soccer team won 10 NCAA soccer championships from 1959 to 1973.Bob Guelker coached the team through 1966, then the team was coached by Harry Keough, a defender who played on the 1950 U.S. World Cup team. SLU played against Southern Illinois University Edwardsville 27 times from 1971-1998 in the ""Bronze Boot"" matches. The rivalry was resurrected in 2018. The 1980 match holds the record as the largest soccer crowd at an NCAA men's game (22,512).Guelker coached at both colleges. 

U.S. Soccer has played several World Cup-qualifying matches here

In November 2015, the U.S. Soccer men's team defeated St. Vincent and the Grenadines in Busch Stadium.Before that, the national team played a qualifier in November 1989, against El Salvador at the Soccer Park in Fenton.The 2015 game drew 45,000 people; the 1989 game had a sellout crowd of 8,500.The team had played two previous matches in St. Louis in the run-up to the November game. The Americans had come to St. Louis twice before in qualifying for the 1990 World Cup. The first was in the preliminary round, when it beat Jamaica to advance into the final round of qualifying. In their second match in that round, the Americans beat Costa Rica.The November 1989 match ended in a tie, but the U.S. team later qualified for the 1990 World Cup in Italy, losing all three matches. It was the first time the American team made the World Cup since 1950.The women's team has played at least one friendly match in town, with another scheduled for the spring.

Soccer's version of the Heisman Trophy, the Hermann Trophy, is awarded through the Missouri Athletic Club, and presented at the club in St. Louis every year.The top NCAA Division I women's and men's soccer player receives the trophy. Previous awardees include players who went on to be on the national roster, including Americans Christen Press, Mia Hamm, Kristine Lilly, Michelle Akers and Tisha Venturini; and Canadian Christine Sinclair; men who went on to the national team include Alexi Lalas and Al Trost.The award is the result of a merge of previous awards for soccer players given by Robert R. Hermann and the club.

The greatest soccer player of all time had scored 1,268 goals over his illustrious career when the New York Cosmos faced the St. Louis Stars on June 23, 1977. But with tenacious marking from Bob O'Leary and Roger Verdi and acrobatic goaltending by John Jackson, the Stars kept the incomparable Pelé and the rest of the Cosmos off the scoreboard in a 2-0 victory. Among his three shots, Pelé sent a header over the net and fired wide on a free kick. His frustration showed with 5 minutes to play when he literally tackled the Stars' Al Trost from behind.""He should have had a caution for that but I guess because it was Pele' the referee decided to let it go,"" Trost said.

After the game, Pelé raced over to Jackson and shook his hand. Pelé, then 37, retired at the end of the '77 season with his Cosmos winning the NASL title. The crowd of 32,605 at Busch Stadium was the largest to see a professional soccer game in St. Louis.

Paul Kopsky, STLhighschoolsports.com


From the soccer program at Christian Brothers College High School, which was inducted into the Missouri sports Hall of Fame this year, to the myriad youth clubs, hundreds of children and teens play soccer in St. Louis.Some of those players grow up to play for the U.S. national teams, including Ruth Harker, a goalkeeper for the University of Missouri-St. Louis. She was named to the first-ever U.S. Women's National Team in 1985, a team that played one game in Italy. Other players include: Lori Chalupny (Nerinx Hall), Kevin Grimes (Rosary), Chris Klein (De Smet), Pat Noonan (De Smet), Steve Ralston (Oakville), Tim Ream (St. Dominic), Josh Sargent (St. Dominic), Becky Sauerbrunn (Ladue Horton Watkins) and Taylor Twellman (SLUH).

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,A 'historic day': St. Louis officials hand off NGA land to federal government,"Dec 13, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/business/local/a-historic-day-st-louis-officials-hand-off-nga-land/article_c9b39745-8553-5820-beb3-a9dc4b90335f.html,"It was a moment over four years in the making, one that many in St. Louis saw as a long shot when the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency announced it needed a new western headquarters.But with a ceremonial marker, on a St. Louis Public Library auditorium stage packed with area politicians and overlooking a crowd of 100-plus people who had a hand in the project, the city signed 97 acres of north St. Louis land over to the federal government.In six years, the 3,100 employees who work at the St. Louis Arsenal on the south Mississippi riverfront will move to a new $1.75 billion intelligence facility in north St. Louis.

“All the i's have been dotted and the t’s have been crossed,” said Otis Williams, who leads St. Louis’ economic development arm and shepherded the project through two mayoral administrations. ""So the property now belongs to the federal government.”It was a process that pitted the Missouri side of the St. Louis region against the Metro East, where flat, open ground stood ready next to Scott Air Force Base and an Illinois Congressional delegation with close ties to the administration of former President Barack Obama was fighting for the same prize.














        
            National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency names 6 possible sites for move in St. Louis area

Five of them are in Missouri, one is in Illinois near Scott Air Force Base.




But the Obama administration’s push for urban renewal and the NGA’s desire to be near universities and employment hubs that draw tech workers and companies supporting the agency’s mapping and intelligence mission gave the site just north of downtown the edge.Even after the Obama administration’s 2016 decision to move the agency to north St. Louis, backers have hardly been on cruise control the last two years. Congressional members needed to win federal appropriations. Negotiations with landowners sometimes deteriorated into eminent domain proceedings. Countless labor hours went into cleaning, demolishing and grading a giant swath of urban land.The room gave a standing ovation to Williams for his efforts.














        
            NGA plans to stay in St. Louis

The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency plans to build its new Western Headquarters in the city, keeping a decades-long relationship with St. Louis and solidifying the spy agency's move into the digital era.




“Otis’ expertise and his prepared, tenacious and professional leadership have led us to today,” St. Louis Mayor Lyda Krewson said.Williams heaped praise on his staff, who also drew loud applause.“Without them and the hard work they put in throughout the process, this project would not have come together,” he said.The job has cost the city and state of Missouri in excess of $114 million to acquire and prepare the land in the St. Louis Place neighborhood — debt that will be repaid with state and local income taxes from NGA employees.The event stage featured former St. Louis Mayor Francis Slay and former Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon — in office when the project started. Gov. Mike Parson, who spoke, ribbed Nixon that while he appreciated his predecessor’s efforts, “I’m going to take as much credit for it as I can.”Rep. Ann Wagner, R-Ballwin, recalled how she stayed up into the early morning hours to get NGA appropriations into a funding bill in Congress despite opposition from the Illinois delegation. St. Louis County Executive Steve Stenger, who was on stage, was thanked for withdrawing proposed St. Louis County sites in Fenton, Northpark and Mehlville in favor of the city site.
St. Louis Board of Aldermen President Lewis Reed and aldermen who shepherded bills for the project — Tammika Hubbard, Brandon Bosley and Marlene Davis — were also there.Rep. William Lacy Clay, D-St. Louis, also a featured speaker, noted the NGA will sit across from the site of the infamous Pruitt-Igoe housing project and called it a game changer for development north of Delmar Boulevard.“The new NGA West is also a powerful symbol that we will no longer turn our backs on north St. Louis,” he said. “We will no longer treat historic black neighborhoods as expendable.”He thanked the dozens of residents who had to move from the neighborhood to assemble the NGA site. Two of them were on stage Thursday.
“Every citizen who relocated their residence or business not only made a sacrifice for their community, they made a brave sacrifice for our country, too,” Clay said.NGA Director Robert Cardillo called it a “historic day” and one “worth celebrating.” He expects a cascading effect of companies moving here, pointing as an example to the small but growing geospatial software firm Boundless’ move to Washington Avenue from New York.














        
            'Placing a bet on St. Louis,' NGA prepares to allow more access for tech firms it hopes will cluster here

NGA designs new facility to protect sensitive intelligence while allowing collaboration. 




“It did eventually come down to which site could best prepare the agency for the future,” Cardillo told the Post-Dispatch. “And yes it is proximity. It is (tech district) Cortex. It is SLU. I was at Harris-Stowe (University) yesterday. I mean, it’s as many as partners as we can get, we want.”Not mentioned Thursday among the hour of congratulations was the man who many say started the whole process: Paul McKee. The developer, who until this summer had development rights to a 1,300-acre chunk of north St. Louis, first submitted a blind response to a request for proposals from an entity that later turned out to be NGA.He had assembled over half the site from private owners and the city’s land bank, but as the city took over the project, he and officials there haggled over a price. Two years after reaching agreement on the NGA land, the city terminated his development rights.Last-minute legal squabbling with McKee, and his lender, the Bank of Washington, threatened to throw a wrench in the project as recently as this fall.Asked about the omission of McKee’s role, Clay, who had backed him when the city was trying to cut him out, said that without the developer, “we wouldn’t have been able to assemble the 97 acres.”














        
            Lacy Clay defends McKee, says SLDC left North St. Louis 'to languish'

The Congressman's defense of the developer follows new information on his use of state tax credits. 




Now, Clay doesn’t care who uses the NGA momentum to develop the surrounding area — as long as it gets done.“I want people’s property values to increase. I want job creation to occur. So whoever wants to step up and do it, you know we’ve been waiting 50 years to get a major development in north St. Louis,” Clay said. “And if it took people like McKee assembling the property and us convincing NGA to do it, so be it. I don’t see anyone else, any other developer knocking down the door to bring development to north St. Louis.”

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,St. Louis could be a discussion topic when Major League Soccer owners meet Thursday,"Dec 13, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/sports/soccer/st-louis-could-be-a-discussion-topic-when-major-league/article_2e32ef7a-bba1-5248-9d1a-08802cf90f9b.html,"NEW YORK • The bid for a Major League Soccer team in St. Louis enters a new stage Thursday, as team owners gather here to discuss, among other things, competing proposals to win two coveted expansion franchises.No decision is expected at this meeting. League Commissioner Don Garber said recently that the process of expanding the 26-team league to 28 could take as long as another year.But these are key weeks to come.

“There are a lot of people still in the running,” said ESPN analyst and former league star Taylor Twellman, who grew up in St. Louis and has close relationships with owners and league staff.League executives and partners, including Twellman, call St. Louis’ ownership group a front-runner. The league says it judges bids based on three criteria:• The financial capacity of the ownership group and its passion for soccer.• The worthiness of the stadium.• The support of the local market.Insiders often say the St. Louis proposal — from World Wide Technology chief executive Jim Kavanaugh and Enterprise Holdings’ Taylor family — has those criteria handled.Kavanaugh knows soccer. He briefly played professionally, owns the minor league St. Louis Football Club, and worked on last year’s failed bid for a team. The Taylors, owners of Enterprise Rent-A-Car, bring deep pockets. The family’s net worth has been reported as high as $13.8 billion.The work to lock up stadium financing has overcome a few important early obstacles: Missouri Gov. Mike Parson has shown support for the effort, unlike Gov. Eric Greitens before him. The state has agreed to sell state-owned highway land on Market Street downtown to the city to serve as the stadium site. City aldermen recently passed a resolution that outlines a bevy of tax incentives, from a permanent property tax break to a 3 percent tax on the sale of hot dogs, beer, T-shirts and other goods at the stadium. And the ownership group has promised to pay for the rest — as much or more than $250 million.Finally, locals and league officials alike praise the St. Louis market as being steeped in soccer history and full of scarf-wearing, flag-waving fans.
Now Kavanaugh and the Taylors have to persuade league owners that they can design and build a stadium that resonates with owners from across the country — not just with St. Louisans — and deliver a competitive, financially sound team to MLS.Meanwhile, it’s unclear what owners think of the St. Louis market. Several National Football League owners also own soccer teams — Los Angeles Rams owner Stan Kroenke, for instance, owns the Colorado Rapids — and those owners are not itching to get an NFL team back to St. Louis.Add to that any residue from last year’s failed soccer stadium effort: Greitens’ statements against “welfare for millionaires” for the proposed stadium, plus a lack of support by city aldermen and, eventually, city voters.Moreover, the league has since added teams in two Midwest cities, Cincinnati and Nashville, Tenn., reducing the perception that the middle of the country is underserved.
MLS now has 23 teams, with three others — Cincinnati, Nashville and Miami — approved and set to start playing by 2020. Garber has long said the league would expand to 28 teams. Last week, in his state-of-the-league address, he suggested that number could grow.“There’s no doubt in my mind that we can support having more than 28 teams in Major League Soccer,” Garber said on Friday. “No doubt in my mind.”But not right away.And that leaves at least six cities vying for the last two spots. A league official recently confirmed that Austin, Texas; Charlotte, N.C.; Detroit; Las Vegas; Phoenix; Raleigh, N.C.; and San Diego have active bids. Sacramento, Calif., says it does, too.The league’s owners meet Thursday at the New York Marriott Downtown.Soccer in St. Louis has a rich history


Five St. Louis players were on team that defeated England in 1950 World Cup

A St. Louisan was the keeper for the 1950 match against England in Brazil, holding a blank slate against the side considered to be the best in the world. Frank Borghi, who died in 2015, was one of five St. Louisans on the team that beat England 1-0.He made a key save in the second half on a header, knocking it wide of the net. “I was lucky to jump in the air and deflect it with my right hand,” he said in a 2009 interview.Brazil's fans, ecstatic to see their main rival lose, carried Borghi off the field on their shoulders. “I didn’t know what they were doing at first,” he said later. “I was kind of nervous. They picked me up and carried me 110 yards to the dugout. It was kind of exciting.”In addition to Borghi, Harry Keough, Gino Pariani, Frank (Peewee) Wallace and Charley Colombo were the St. Louisans on the field for that historic win over England. (Also on the team from St. Louis were Bob Annis, a reserve who didn’t play, and assistant coach William “Chubby” Lyons.) Keough died in 2012, Pariani in 2007, Colombo in 1986 and Wallace in 1979.

In 1995, a local team won a professional soccer title














FILE PHOTO APRIL, 1995 -- Kansas City's #14 Lee Tschantret is knocked down by the Ambush's #6 Steve Maurer as they pursue a loose ball.


KEVIN MANNING


On April 25, 1995, the Ambush staged a comeback to sweep the Harrisburg Heat in four games to become the only team in St. Louis professional soccer to win a title.The title was won three years after Dr. Abraham Hawatmeh brought the Tulsa Ambush to St. Louis. With the NHL locked out in 1994, the Ambush had the honor of playing the first regular-season game at the new Kiel Center (now the Enterprise Center).The team would lead the league in attendance that season, averaging 7,881 a game.The Ambush folded in 2000; a team with the same name now plays in the Major Arena Soccer League. The area has a men's team, St. Louis FC, in the USL Championship, a league one step below the top professional level, Major League Soccer. A team in the failed Women's Professional Soccer league, St. Louis Athletica, didn't win a championship in its short-lived tenure. Other now-defunct professional soccer teams include: Steamers (Major Indoor Soccer League), Storm (MISL), and Steamers (World Indoor Soccer League/MISL).

The last top-level men's professional soccer team was the Stars
The St. Louis Stars were a team in the North American Soccer League, which was the top-level pro league from 1968 to 1984. The Stars played from the start of the league until 1977, when the team moved to California. Well-known national players were on the team, including Al Trost. (He taught at McCluer North High during the offseason.) Other well-known players included Pat McBride and English goalie Peter Bonetti.The team wanted a better home field than Washington University's Francis Field (which had a 10,000-person capacity), and had trouble getting Busch Stadium for more than a few games during their season.For the 1977 season, the team drew an average of 9,111 fans, but that included a crowd of more than 32,000 at Busch Stadium (the game featured Pelé).Robert R. Hermann was one of the owners of the team. 

Several local teams were once best in the nation
Several St. Louis teams have won the National Challenge Cup, now known as the U.S. Open Cup. The tournament matches soccer teams from various levels, including Major League Soccer teams, in a single-elimination tournament to decide the best soccer team in the country. In May 1920, in what the St. Louis Star described as ""the greatest soccer game ever witnessed on any American field,"" the Ben Millers, a St. Louis team, beat a Massachusetts team to win the title.More than 10,000 people watched the game at Federal League Park, a stadium near the current St. Louis University campus. The St. Louis team was the first outside the East coast to win the title.Many of the teams in the early decades were owned by companies, hence the familiar names.Other St. Louis teams went on to play, and win, the Challenge Cup, including:• Scullin Steel: 1922 (The team went to the finals again in 1923, but had to forfeit a replay after a tie.)• Stix, Baer and Fuller: 1933, 1934• Central Breweries: 1935• Simpkins-Ford: 1948, 1950• Kutis: 1957, 1986 • Busch: 1988

European clubs used to come here to play against local teams
From the 1930s through '70s, St. Louis was a regular stop for foreign clubs making American tours. There were no professional American leagues, so teams played top amateur clubs.Over the years, clubs came from: Canada, Mexico, England, Chile, Germany, Brazil, Czechoslovakia, Sweden, Scotland, France and Turkey, among others. Manchester United came twice, in 1950 and 1960, playing matches at old Public Schools Stadium. The St. Louis teams almost always lost, though there was a 1-1 tie with Liverpool in 1964.The games may have been regular events, but that didn’t mean they weren’t special.“It was fun playing against (those teams),” said Bob Kehoe, a defender who took part in several of them in his long career. “They were almost always better than we were. We’re fledglings, newcomers to the game and they’ve been playing for hundreds of years. We were rarely, if ever, successful. But we’d learn from them, pick up nuances, say, ‘I never saw a team do that before.’ It was enjoyable, even if you got embarrassed.”Manchester City played a team of CYC All-Stars in St. Louis in 1958, in front of about 4,000 people. The teams played at the Public Schools Stadium. ""As expected, the all-professional English League team won the match, by a score of 6-2,"" read the Post-Dispatch article. ""The St. Louis players, all amateurs, were delighted to have held the First Division team to a 1-1 score at half time and to have escaped with only six goals charged against them, one of those a penalty kick.""

The Billikens men's soccer team won 10 NCAA soccer championships from 1959 to 1973.Bob Guelker coached the team through 1966, then the team was coached by Harry Keough, a defender who played on the 1950 U.S. World Cup team. SLU played against Southern Illinois University Edwardsville 27 times from 1971-1998 in the ""Bronze Boot"" matches. The rivalry was resurrected in 2018. The 1980 match holds the record as the largest soccer crowd at an NCAA men's game (22,512).Guelker coached at both colleges.

In November 2015, the U.S. Soccer men's team defeated St. Vincent and the Grenadines in Busch Stadium.Before that, the national team played a qualifier in November 1989, against El Salvador at the Soccer Park in Fenton.The 2015 game drew 45,000 people; the 1989 game had a sellout crowd of 8,500.The team had played two previous matches in St. Louis in the run-up to the November game. The Americans had come to St. Louis twice before in qualifying for the 1990 World Cup. The first was in the preliminary round, when it beat Jamaica to advance into the final round of qualifying. In their second match in that round, the Americans beat Costa Rica.The November 1989 match ended in a tie, but the U.S. team later qualified for the 1990 World Cup in Italy, losing all three matches. It was the first time the American team made the World Cup since 1950.The women's team has played at least one friendly match in town, with another scheduled for the spring.

Soccer's version of the Heisman Trophy, the Hermann Trophy, is awarded through the Missouri Athletic Club, and presented at the club in St. Louis every year.The top NCAA Division I women's and men's soccer player receives the trophy. Previous awardees include players who went on to be on the national roster, including Americans Christen Press, Mia Hamm, Kristine Lilly, Michelle Akers and Tisha Venturini; and Canadian Christine Sinclair; men who went on to the national team include Alexi Lalas and Al Trost.The award is the result of a merge of previous awards for soccer players given by Robert R. Hermann and the club.

The greatest soccer player of all time had scored 1,268 goals over his illustrious career when the New York Cosmos faced the St. Louis Stars on June 23, 1977. But with tenacious marking from Bob O'Leary and Roger Verdi and acrobatic goaltending by John Jackson, the Stars kept the incomparable Pelé and the rest of the Cosmos off the scoreboard in a 2-0 victory. Among his three shots, Pelé sent a header over the net and fired wide on a free kick. His frustration showed with 5 minutes to play when he literally tackled the Stars' Al Trost from behind.""He should have had a caution for that but I guess because it was Pele' the referee decided to let it go,"" Trost said.

After the game, Pelé raced over to Jackson and shook his hand. Pelé, then 37, retired at the end of the '77 season with his Cosmos winning the NASL title. The crowd of 32,605 at Busch Stadium was the largest to see a professional soccer game in St. Louis.

Paul Kopsky, STLhighschoolsports.com


From the soccer program at Christian Brothers College High School, which was inducted into the Missouri sports Hall of Fame this year, to the myriad youth clubs, hundreds of children and teens play soccer in St. Louis.Some of those players grow up to play for the U.S. national teams, including Ruth Harker, a goalkeeper for the University of Missouri-St. Louis. She was named to the first-ever U.S. Women's National Team in 1985, a team that played one game in Italy. Other players include: Lori Chalupny (Nerinx Hall), Kevin Grimes (Rosary), Chris Klein (De Smet), Pat Noonan (De Smet), Steve Ralston (Oakville), Tim Ream (St. Dominic), Josh Sargent (St. Dominic), Becky Sauerbrunn (Ladue Horton Watkins) and Taylor Twellman (SLUH).

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri governor expected to name treasurer pick next week,"Dec 12, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-governor-expected-to-name-treasurer-pick-next-week/article_098e939c-a7ed-5506-9acf-cb6c73181c2b.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Gov. Mike Parson could announce his pick for Missouri’s next state treasurer as early as next week.With the clock ticking down to the holidays, an administration official told the Post-Dispatch Tuesday that the Republican governor is likely to act on the vacancy before the Christmas break.The screening process has been underway since mid-November, after Parson announced that Treasurer Eric Schmitt would replace Josh Hawley as attorney general when Hawley is sworn into the U.S. Senate in January.

In naming Schmitt attorney general, Parson said he felt comfortable about the fit because Schmitt had already been vetted by Missouri voters when he was elected treasurer in the 2016 election.Parson also showed an affinity for previous elected experience when he appointed former Senate Majority Floor Leader Mike Kehoe, R-Jefferson City, to Parson's old job as lieutenant governor, following the June 1 resignation of his scandal-plagued predecessor, Eric Greitens.If that same sentiment applies to the treasurer job, Parson is likely looking at someone who has held or is holding elected office. And, given that the current roster of state government leaders is comprised of white men, the governor may be looking at women and minority Republicans to fill the $107,746 per year position.Among those mentioned as possibilities are Republican state Reps. Holly Rehder of Sikeston, Scott Fitzpatrick of Shell Knob, Jean Evans of Manchester and Shamed Dogan of Ballwin, the lone black member of the GOP caucus.
Rehder told The Associated Press last week that she had let Parson's office know she's interested in the job.Rehder, a member of the House since 2012, has led the push to create a statewide prescription drug monitoring program as a way to fight the opioid epidemic. She made an unsuccessful bid for House Speaker earlier this year.Fitzpatrick, a business owner, is chairman of the House Budget Committee, which is one of the most powerful positions in the General Assembly. He has been in the House since 2012.
Dogan told the Post-Dispatch earlier he had been in contact with the governor’s office about the opening.Elected in 2014, Dogan is a former Ballwin alderman who once worked for the National Republican Senatorial Committee and for former U.S. Sen. Jim Talent of Missouri. He chairs the House committee on local government.Evans is a real estate agent who was elected in 2016. During the 2018 legislative session, Evans emerged as the sponsor of legislation that put a question on the ballot to raise the state’s gas tax. Despite vocal support from Parson, voters rejected the referendum.On the Senate side, Sandy Crawford, a Republican from Buffalo who replaced Parson in the Senate in 2017 is a former member of the House and a former banker.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri still scrutinizing White House official Nick Ayers' tortured ties to state,"Dec 10, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-still-scrutinizing-white-house-official-nick-ayers-tortured-ties/article_8abd13c2-7ccc-510c-8230-e51777eafdf0.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • A Republican operative who served as campaign adviser to former Gov. Eric Greitens says he spoke to Missouri Ethics Commission investigators last month regarding lingering campaign finance mysteries dating to the 2016 election.The meeting, Michael Hafner told the Post-Dispatch, was in regard to a complaint filed with the commission in July alleging that former Greitens adviser and outgoing White House official Nick Ayers may have solicited campaign contributions from a “restricted” donor and may have illegally worked to conceal donors’ identities.A sharp-elbowed GOP strategist, Ayers announced Sunday he would be leaving the White House instead of serving as President Donald Trump’s chief of staff. He is currently Vice President Mike Pence’s chief of staff. Ayers will reportedly lead a Trump-allied Super PAC in advance of the 2020 election.

Ayers is one of the central figures mentioned in the complaint — and Hafner’s acknowledgement of a recent meeting with investigators is the latest indication that ethics officials have not lost interest in scandals dating to the Greitens era. (The MEC neither confirms nor denies the existence of ongoing probes.)Hafner said he was asked about the complaint, filed by state Rep. Jay Barnes, R-Jefferson City, and said he had been in contact with the Federal Election Commission regarding a separate complaint related to Ayers filed by the group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.














        
            Complaint against Greitens for Missouri and A New Missouri, Inc.

Complaint against Greitens for Missouri and A New Missouri, Inc. presented to the Missouri Ethics Commission




“I will continue to comply with the ongoing investigations by federal and state election regulatory agencies into former Governor Greitens and his staff’s fundraising practices,” Hafner said in an email.Greitens, a Republican, resigned on June 1 under a cloud. While the most eyebrow-raising issue surrounding the former governor was his infidelity — and related allegations of abuse and coercion — peripheral controversies included the labyrinthine way Greitens’ campaign apparatus financed its operations.Ayers’ notoriety is rooted in the convoluted world of dark money mechanisms and political ad buying. He formerly worked with a political firm called Target Enterprises, in which he often was an ad buyer on campaigns on which he consulted, a lucrative position that provides the buyer with a percentage share of the cost of an advertisement. Financial disclosure forms filed when he joined Pence’s staff in 2017 showed he had a net worth of between $12 million and $54 million.Alyssa Farah, press secretary for Pence, defended Ayers after Barnes filed his complaint in July: “This is a complaint lodged against former clients of Mr. Ayers, who has always complied with federal and state campaign finance laws meticulously, and did so in this instance as well.”Catherine Hanaway, attorney for Greitens’ campaign, said in an emailed statement in July that the complaint was “full of false accusations.”She declined to say on Monday whether she had been in contact with the MEC since Barnes filed his complaint.Hafner, who said he left the Greitens campaign in early 2015 before Ayers came on board, also told Barnes’ investigative committee that Greitens’ campaign discussed soliciting donations from foreign nationals, which would be a violation of federal law.“There were conversations that we had where foreign money was discussed and the possibility of foreign money being contributed to an entity,” Hafner testified on May 29, shortly before Greitens announced his resignation.Hafner said he left the campaign soon after that incident and was not aware if those discussions continued.“I stand by my testimony taken under oath on five occasions since November 2016 to the Missouri Ethics Commission, St. Louis Circuit Attorney’s Office, Attorney General’s Office, and Missouri House Investigative Committee,” he said.His most recent meeting with the MEC was not under oath, Hafner said. He testified to the House twice under oath.
In Barnes’ complaint, one potential donor, according to an email the Missouri House investigative committee obtained, was employed by a company that “manages money for the state of Missouri” — and could have thus been barred by federal law from donating to political campaigns.It is unclear to what extent, if any, Ayers was involved in discussions with that particular donor. But an email from December 2015 shows that Ayers was in contact with the Greitens campaign about a person he referred to as a “restricted donor.”Barnes also wrote that the committee obtained a June 27, 2016, email to Greitens fundraiser Meredith Gibbons from an undisclosed “early supporter and fundraiser of Greitens.” The person writes to Gibbons that “I’m pretty sure he’s not allowed to give,” because “[redacted] manages money for the state of Missouri.“Eric can mention the 501(c)(4) if applicable, but no idea how [redacted] will react to that,” the email says.It is unclear from Barnes’ July complaint who the prospective donor was, and whether the donor ultimately cut a check to help propel Greitens to office.
But Barnes wrote that on June 29, 2016, two days after the email, a 501(c)(4) group called Freedom Frontier donated $500,000 to LG PAC, the mysterious entity that spent more than $4 million to attack Greitens’ competitors in the 2016 primary.Though the Greitens campaign denied coordinating with LG PAC, Ayers filed a financial disclosure form last year that said he worked for Freedom Frontier during the 2016 campaign.The group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington revealed last month, citing Freedom Frontier’s 2016 tax forms, that 75 percent of Freedom Frontier’s spending that year was political — a violation of tax law because the majority of a section 501(c)(4) nonprofit’s spending cannot go toward politics.The group also wrote that Freedom Frontier’s Form 990 tax filing also showed that it paid Clark Fork Group LLC $354,000. Ayers has reported receiving compensation from Clark Fork Group in his financial disclosure forms.In a separate matter, the Missouri attorney general’s office says it is still investigating whether Greitens used taxpayer resources for political purposes. Last week, Attorney General Josh Hawley, who is heading to the U.S. Senate next month, said the investigation was ongoing.Gov. Mike Parson’s office said the administration is still producing documents to Hawley. Part of an open records request by Hawley asks for any emails between the governor’s office and Austin Chambers, a top Greitens political adviser and Ayers protege, and any emails to C5 Consulting, a now-defunct political shop owned by Ayers.Locke Thompson, a Republican who will become Cole County prosecutor in January, also could examine criminal cases outgoing prosecutor Mark Richardson passed on — and could review any new cases that come to his office.Thompson said he would be open to examining any files on Greitens.“My priority needs to be on the violent crimes, but at some point I’m sure I would look at the investigative files as well, and that (Greitens) may be one of them,” he said.Chuck Raasch of the Post-Dispatch contributed to this report.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Messenger: By quitting early, several Missouri lawmakers show the need for Amendment 1","Dec 9, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/columns/tony-messenger/messenger-by-quitting-early-several-missouri-lawmakers-show-the-need/article_399546d0-82d2-5dc6-b456-4a80b7987322.html,"Eight years ago, Jason Crowell tried to do in the Missouri Senate what voters did last month.The Legislature was debating an overhaul to state political ethics laws, and Crowell, a Republican from Cape Girardeau, sought to add an amendment to the bill that would create a two-year waiting period before state lawmakers could become lobbyists.Many of his colleagues, one in particularly, took offense.

Sen. John Griesheimer, R-Washington, an affable man known outside the chamber as “Greesy,” suggested current members of the Legislature should be exempted from the proposal.“Do you want to be a lobbyist?” Crowell asked his Republican colleague.“Well,” Griesheimer said, “maybe.”The amendment failed. A watered down version of the bill passed and was later overturned by the courts. And that’s why, in November, Missouri voters were presented with the opportunity to pass Amendment 1. Sponsored by the bipartisan coalition known as Clean Missouri, the constitutional amendment did many things contemplated by lawmakers over the years but never passed, including limiting gifts from lobbyists and closing the revolving door that in Missouri had become legendary.Griesheimer never became a lobbyist. He returned to Franklin County and was elected presiding commissioner. But plenty of his colleagues did.In 2005, a study by the Center for Public Integrity ranked Missouri fifth in the nation in the number of lawmakers who became lobbyists. There were 45 at the time, and many more have been added since then.The biggest moves were at the top of the food chain: former Speaker of the House Steve Tilley, who still uses a massive campaign account to supplement his lobbying; and former Senate leaders Michael Gibbons and Tom Dempsey, who both ended up working with or for companies or individuals who were major donors to their previous campaigns.In both parties there have been countless similar examples.Some of those former lawmakers may end up becoming very good and knowledgeable lobbyists, but there’s a reason that Congress has long had a one-year cooling-off period and Missouri will be joining many states with a two-year prohibition against lobbying. It reduces the opportunities for lawmakers to do the bidding of their biggest donors while in the Legislature and then go to work for them immediately after they’ve passed legislation to cut their taxes or benefit them in some other way.
This week, almost as a validation of what Missouri voters did in November, several state lawmakers resigned their seats before Amendment 1 took effect on Dec. 6, to preserve their right to cash in on their public service immediately.In St. Louis there was Democratic Sen. Jake Hummel and in Ferguson there was state Rep. Courtney Allen Curtis, also a Democrat. Elsewhere, Republican state Reps. Kevin Corlew and Kirk Mathews hung it up early. In all, there are 13 openings currently in the House, and three more in the Senate, most because of the highest number of resignations since 1994.Some of those lawmakers were awarded plum state jobs by new Gov. Mike Parson.If you were among the 62 percent of Missouri voters who were on the right side of Amendment 1, lawmakers leaving the Capitol are seemingly validating your vote. Meanwhile, others are already trying to overturn it. A Missouri Republican Party committee has donated $150,000 to a hypocritically named political action committee called Fair Missouri that hopes to overturn at least some elements of that which voters just passed.

The @MissouriGOP has already started and funded a committee to overturn the @CleanMissouri redistricting reforms approved by voters. This is about preserving the power to gerrymander legislative districts. Absurd insult to Missouri voters. pic.twitter.com/UjY9xmS2rL— Tony Messenger (@tonymess) November 26, 2018

Apparently, the people in power are afraid of change.“The way business gets done in the Missouri Capitol is changing, and for the better,” says Sean Nicholson, who ran the Amendment 1 campaign. “A couple of years ago, legislators created a tiny speed bump for politicians who wanted to become lobbyists. But we could all see through that law for what it was. As former U.S. Attorney Catherine Hanaway said, it was ‘lip service’ to ethics reform — or more forcefully, ‘Exhibit A of how our legislature is breaching the public trust.’”Asked this week by the Associated Press’ David Lieb whether he planned to become a lobbyist, Curtis, who resigned one minute before the new law took effect, echoed Griesheimer:“If that opportunity came in the future,” he said, “I wouldn’t necessarily say no.”Of course he wouldn’t.Whoever replaces Curtis in the Legislature won’t have the same opportunity. Instead, he or she will go to Jefferson City knowing that their public service won’t necessarily lead to a payday on the back end, and they’ll have to stretch their per diem a little bit to pay for their own meals.“Voters created the chance to clean up their state government with hundreds of thousands of signatures last year, and then they made it happen last month at the ballot box,” Nicholson says. “The revolving door is closed.”

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Editorial: Medical marijuana is legal in Missouri. So don't punish its legal users.,"Dec 8, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-medical-marijuana-is-legal-in-missouri-so-don-t/article_562d64f8-3853-5b87-a1f2-fdad641c161e.html,"The Missouri Department of Social Services is grappling with the decision of whether to allow medical marijuana users to receive welfare benefits. Voters’ decision on Nov. 6 to legalize medical marijuana use across Missouri placed this question squarely in a legal gray area, but this question has an easy answer: People who are exercising their legal right to use clinically prescribed medicine should not be punished for it with restricted welfare benefits. The new law took effect Thursday.The department would be within its legal right under federal law to prevent marijuana users from accessing welfare benefits. Under the federal Controlled Substances Act, marijuana — medical or recreational — remains a Schedule I illegal drug, regarded as equal in danger to heroin even though it clearly isn’t. But another piece of federal legislation, the Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment, prohibits the government from using the restriction of federal funds to inhibit state marijuana laws.Even though the federal government can’t enforce the medical marijuana prohibition in Missouri, the state still could exercise its discretion to bar users of medical marijuana from receiving welfare. Missouri now joins 33 other states that openly defy the federal government regarding public access to medical marijuana.

The Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld a principle known as the anti-commandeering doctrine, which dictates that the federal government cannot “command” state officials to enforce federal laws. It’s because of this doctrine that the federal government can only request, but not demand, that local law enforcers assist with detaining criminal undocumented immigrants targeted for removal.If the federal government wants to enforce medical marijuana laws in the states, it must use its own resources.
As the Post-Dispatch’s Kurt Erickson reported, the Missouri Department of Social Services finds itself in legal limbo when it comes to restricting welfare recipients’ access to medically prescribed marijuana.
Welfare is designed as a social safety net to protect the most vulnerable in society, who include not only families in financial straits but also people who cannot work because of medical conditions or disabilities. The state government has no business deciding which medicine welfare recipients should be allowed access to, and which should not. The government especially should not be making such determinations based on purely punitive and subjective motives.Medical marijuana is widely accepted by doctors as having therapeutic value; 64.2 percent of medical marijuana prescriptions go to patients with chronic and severe pain. It also has been useful in easing the effects of Parkinson’s, post-traumatic stress disorder, epilepsy, glaucoma and cancer. These aren’t partiers trying to sneak a legal high. They’re patients struggling with physically and financially debilitating illnesses.While the letter of the law doesn’t compel the state to provide welfare to medical marijuana users, Gov. Mike Parson should yield to his own sense of compassion and not punish people who already are suffering enough."

Mike Parson may be inclined to support the false solution of ""right to work"" on a county-by-county level across Missouri as revealed in a recent press investigation.Missourians rejected ""right to work"" in August, with 67.5 percent of Missourians voting against this so-called solution to our economic ills. It is time for Republicans to stop blaming organized labor for Missouri’s economic ills and instead start offering real solutions, like investment in higher education by offering all high school graduates the opportunity to earn an associate’s degree or professional certification at no cost to them.

It costs approximately $10,000 a year to train an apprentice, and unions pay this cost so Missouri can benefit from an increased ability to meet demand for skilled workers. Labor unions support investment in our crumbling infrastructure because we know the benefit of investment in Missouri’s transportation network that creates quality local jobs and moves goods across our state.
Two-thirds of the Missourians who voted in August voted no. My hope is that the Republican legislative majority and Gov. Parson do not waste more time considering these divisive anti-worker issues, but that we work in a bipartisan fashion to put Missourians to work, provide quality educational opportunities and move the state forward.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Hawley greets his successor with smiles as under-the-radar issues, and changes, loom","Dec 7, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/hawley-greets-his-successor-with-smiles-as-under-the-radar/article_a380c33f-0b5f-5fc2-a3e7-771520f975b8.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Outgoing Attorney General Josh Hawley, during a conference room meeting on Thursday with his senior staff, heaped praise on his deputies and asked them to detail office accomplishments to incoming Attorney General Eric Schmitt.Schmitt, who like Hawley is a Republican, will take over the roughly 300-person office on Jan. 3 when Hawley is sworn in as a U.S. senator.Though the two officials, and their staffs, exhibited relaxed moods during the open press portion of the meeting, former staffers have described heavy turnover, low morale and tumultuous management during Hawley’s tenure.

Soon after the meeting, the office of Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft, also a Republican, announced it would investigate whether Hawley improperly used taxpayer resources for political purposes.Schmitt, careful not to criticize Hawley, has signaled that he intends to make subtle changes in the way he will run the office. But first, he said in an interview, he wants to ensure continuity .“We want to talk to people, we want to do an evaluation, but by and large a lot of those folks are going to be staying,” Schmitt said of attorney general’s office staffers.“And that’s a positive thing. That’s the kind of continuity I think Missourians should expect.”














        
            How Josh Hawley shook up the Missouri attorney general's office — and what happened next

Critics say Hawley's administration bled staffers and dedicated limited resources to firing salvos toward the federal government. Hawley said a reorganization was long overdue.




When asked what he would do differently than Hawley, Schmitt said he would emphasize crime prevention and collaboration with local prosecutors. He named three county prosecutors to his transition team, including St. Charles County Prosecutor Timothy Lohmar, a Republican.“One of the things I think is important as the chief law enforcement officer is as it relates to crime, people deserve to feel safe,” Schmitt said. “Their neighborhoods should be safe, and that’s certainly going to be a focus of mine.”Lohmar said it would be difficult for Schmitt to launch some kind of crackdown on crime. The attorney general’s office lacks original jurisdiction in criminal matters.“We bristle when we hear the attorney general, or candidates for attorney general, refer to themselves as the chief law enforcement officer of the state, because they’re absolutely not,” Lohmar said.“They don’t have any authority over us or what we do.”But Lohmar said he expects Schmitt to devote greater resources than Hawley to helping local prosecutors.
“They’ve always been a great resource,” Lohmar said. “I anticipate Eric is going to bolster those efforts.”Lohmar also said he expects more commitment to state issues. Hawley, in his two years as attorney general, devoted unprecedented resources to challenging the federal government. The cases, prepared by a new “Federalism Unit,” raised his profile as he was running for U.S. Senate.Lohmar called the unit “(totally) bogus” and a mechanism for “pandering.”“I think the AG’s focus has always been and should always be on the domestic issues and not so much battling the federal government,” Lohmar said. “I think Eric is in tune with that.”
Schmitt did say he believed addressing federal government overreach is important. He also suggested he would use his platform to push to address perceived injustices within the state’s criminal justice system.In the state Senate, where he served from 2009 to 2017, Schmitt sponsored legislation after the 2014 Ferguson protests aimed at stopping St. Louis County police departments from aggressively issuing traffic tickets to raise revenue. Schmitt called the practice “taxation by citation.”“I believe at the core of my soul that people ought to be treated as individuals, and they ought to be treated fairly under the law, and not as just some revenue-generating mechanism by these cities,” Schmitt said.The Post-Dispatch reported last week that Schmitt’s chief of staff in the treasurer’s office, Andrew Dziedzic, had at one point downloaded the text-message deleting app Confide on his smartphone.The app’s use plagued former Gov. Eric Greitens’ administration, leading to accusations he and his staffers destroyed public records in violation of the law.“We don’t use those apps to communicate,” Schmitt said. “We never have, never will. I don’t use them — never have, never will.”Hawley, in response to a question from a reporter, said he was not aware that his former chief of staff, Evan Rosell, had used Confide when he was working in the attorney general’s office. The Kansas City Star reported last week that Rosell had used the app.Schmitt, in an interview, demurred when asked whether he would investigate A New Missouri, a nonprofit group allied with Greitens. Elad Gross, a St. Louis lawyer who has announced his candidacy for attorney general as a Democrat, has urged the attorney general to investigate under the authority of the state’s consumer fraud statutes.Schmitt said it was too early to comment, and did not even commit in an interview to seeking the office in 2020.“I am focused right now on the transition and the swearing-in and again, having that office be the best law firm in the state,” Schmitt said.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Parson calls for a 'long overdue' statewide prescription drug monitoring program during St. Louis visit,"Dec 5, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/parson-calls-for-a-long-overdue-statewide-prescription-drug-monitoring/article_c5dda0b4-7be1-55ed-9215-227aadd3349f.html,"ST. LOUIS • Missouri Gov. Mike Parson said Wednesday in St. Louis that he’d like to sign a statewide prescription drug monitoring program into law next year, a move he says is “long overdue.”“We’re the only state in the United States that doesn’t have that,” said Parson, flanked by members of his cabinet and St. Louis officials, who gathered for a discussion on the opioid epidemic. “The reality of it is, people are losing their lives every day from a terrible situation. And we’ve got to figure out to make sure we have all the tools everybody needs to be able to fight that.”Bills creating a prescription drug monitoring program, or PDMP, have been debated in the Missouri Legislature for years, but none of the proposals has made it across the finish line.

Last year, Parson’s predecessor, Eric Greitens, issued an executive order calling for his own version of a monitoring program, but Republicans and Democrats alike said his plan fell short of providing a comprehensive approach to fighting drug abuse.Under Greitens’ measure, the Department of Health and Senior Services pays Express Scripts and other pharmacy benefit management companies such as UnitedHealthcare and CVS to analyze doctor and pharmacy prescription and dispensing data for schedule II through IV controlled substances.The agency then uses the information to identify activity indicating that controlled substances are being inappropriately prescribed, dispensed or obtained.But Greitens’ plan differs significantly from what is in place in other states and in local counties and jurisdictions across Missouri, including many in the St. Louis region. Those programs track when patients are prescribed an opioid painkiller, typically making that information available to doctors — a feature absent from Greitens’ order.PDMP proponents argue that it allows doctors and pharmacists to identify “doctor shoppers,” or individuals who go from physician to physician to continually be prescribed the same drugs. The hope is that they can intervene before the addiction spirals out control, or identify anyone who may be selling the drugs.“We all know prescriptions is where a lot of this problem started. Prescriptions is where some of this problem will end,” St. Louis Mayor Lyda Krewson said.When prescription drugs become too difficult or expensive to obtain, users often turn to heroin, or worse, cross-contaminated drugs containing fentanyl: a drug that is far more potent and more deadly.
St. Louis city and county are on pace for record-setting overdose deaths this year, after a record 760 opioid-related deaths in the St. Louis region in 2017.There were 951 total opioid-related deaths in Missouri in 2017, according to the state’s Department of Health and Senior Services.Parson offered few details on what potential PDMP legislation would have his support, but the topic will be a familiar one for state lawmakers.Opponents to past proposals feared they would violate citizens’ right to privacy, allowing sensitive information to be stored on a government database, vulnerable to data breaches.
Parson said that with new leadership in the governor’s office, and in the Missouri House and Senate, a measure might finally pass in 2019.The governor will have one key ally in the Senate: Earlier this month, Republicans picked Sen. Dave Schatz, R-Sullivan, to succeed Senate President Pro Tem Ron Richard. Schatz has previously sponsored bills establishing a statewide PDMP.But there remains little appetite to expand Medicaid in Missouri, something officials in states that have expanded, such as Ohio, say helped curb their own opioid crisis by giving low-income adults more access to addiction and mental health services.“I think there’s a lot of things that have to be on the table. But let me first say, most of the states are having problems just like us. So it’s not that Missouri is unique in this by no means, a lot of states are still having problems, even the ones that have Medicaid expansion are still having troubles, too,” Parson said. “We’ve got to fix what we have first before we start expanding something that’s a problem.”Also on Wednesday, Parson paid a visit to the St. Louis Missouri Veterans Home and spoke with small business leaders in the region about rising health care costs.

Mike Parson is launching a tour of the state Tuesday designed to address myriad problems in Missouri’s health care system, including painkiller abuse, rural hospital closings and health insurance costs.Entering his sixth month as Missouri’s chief executive, the Republican’s four-day trek includes stops in St. Louis, Kansas City and his hometown of Bolivar, where he will hold a rural health summit aimed at addressing the future of small-town hospitals.

“We need to be innovative in our approach to strengthen, improve, and support our rural hospitals,” said Dr. Randall Williams, director of the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services.The focus on health care comes amid calls for Missouri to expand Medicaid. If supporters can collect enough signatures, voters could be asked to support such a move when they go to the polls in 2020.Studies have shown that states like Missouri that did not expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act have seen more struggles in rural hospitals. Despite that, Parson is not advocating for an expansion.Rather, administration officials, including Williams and the state’s new Medicaid director, former House Speaker Todd Richardson, are looking at a series of programs to shore up health care in rural areas.Among the ideas is a pilot program with the University of Missouri designed to lure more doctors to practice in smaller communities.Richardson, a Poplar Bluff Republican who took over the $10 billion-per-year MO HealthNet program in October, is focusing on reducing fraud and abuse within the program as a way to rein in costs.The state is in the midst of a $2.7 million contract with McKinsey & Co. to review fraud within the system, which serves nearly 1 million Missourians.In 2013, a private contractor identified more than 220,000 people it said should be dropped from Illinois’ Medicaid program, which is nearly three times larger than Missouri’s.Initial results of the work in Missouri could be released in January.
The tour also will include a stop in St. Joseph to discuss a mental health initiative that would boost treatment services through a telemedicine program.

In St. Louis on Wednesday, Parson will meet with Mayor Lyda Krewson and law enforcement officials to discuss the state’s opioid crisis.Frustrated by the inability of lawmakers to approve a statewide drug monitoring program, counties in Missouri have banded together to launch their own programs.
But with the retirement of Sen. Rob Schaaf, R-St. Joseph, who had blocked the creation of a statewide prescription database, lawmakers and Parson are on track to make Missouri the last state to implement such a program when they begin their annual legislative session in January.Along with putting a monitoring program on the books, Parson wants to focus on treatment options for drug users, as well as drug treatment courts, to address an epidemic that is causing more than 1,000 overdose deaths a year.














        
            Solutions hard to find as opioid epidemic keeps hitting St. Louis hard



At the event, Parson and Krewson “will discuss the importance of state and local partnerships in tackling the challenges in curbing the opioid crisis.”While in the St. Louis area, Parson also will visit the once-troubled St. Louis Veterans Home. During his tenure as lieutenant governor, Parson raised red flags about substandard care at the state-run facility in Bellefontaine Neighbors.Since then, the facility has undergone renovations, as well as a change in leadership.Later Wednesday the governor plans to host a roundtable discussion on health insurance costs for small business owners, highlighting a program that allows employers to band together in insurance pools to lower premium costs.Thursday includes stops in Kansas City and Warrensburg, followed by an event Friday in Jefferson City.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,BenFred: No reason for MLS to keep St. Louis waiting,"Dec 2, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/sports/columns/ben-frederickson/benfred-no-reason-for-mls-to-keep-st-louis-waiting/article_712a79c4-44e6-51ab-939b-e7d395190cee.html,"Time is of the essence.The phrase became the staccato drumbeat of the latest quest to bring a Major League Soccer expansion team to St. Louis.No minute could be wasted. The stakes were too high. The competition from other cities was too intense. Miss this chance, and it would be the last.

St. Louis hurried up. Now, it must wait. Is anyone else wondering why?A memo to MLS Commissioner Don Garber: The best bid for what is likely to be your league’s final expansion team is ready for your approval. Its final big box was checked before the first day of December. If MLS wants to be in St. Louis as bad as St. Louis has been led to believe, there should be no reason to delay. Show us some love.A whole lot of public enthusiasm. An appealing ownership group. Available land. And, perhaps most important, approving lawmakers.














        
            St. Louis aldermen pass Major League Soccer tax incentive plan, 26-2

If all 28 aldermen vote, the proposal would need 15 in support to pass today. City leaders and members of the soccer team ownership group expect it to easily — 16 aldermen plus President Lewis Reed have already signed on as co-sponsors.




These were the must-haves MLS asked the Taylor and Kavanaugh families to secure to land a team. Let’s check in on the progress made.The soccer fans in St. Louis have flooded the zone, from social media posts to town-hall attendance.The one-two punch of the Taylor and Kavanugh families offers MLS one of the most appealing ownership groups imaginable. The group is tight-knit. Finances are flush. That the franchise would be majority-owned by women is more than just a feather in the cap.The Missouri Department of Transportation Commission approved a resolution that allows an option for the city to purchase the land at the potential stadium site. The downtown space, which was already appealing to MLS, is moving toward making the jump from renderings to real-life construction.And on Friday morning, the city Board of Aldermen offered a resounding endorsement of the resolution that outlines tax incentives and financial details for the stadium. The proposal passed 26 to 2, and both dissenting votes were prefaced by compliments. Aldermanic President Lewis Reed was the resolution’s chief sponsor. Mayor Lyda Krewson has been an outspoken advocate. Gov. Mike Parson is on board. Every meaningful light is green.
St. Louis is ready to throw its trust behind this ownership group. But can it trust MLS? There are more reasons to question the staying power and commitment of MLS than there are to question the commitment of the Taylors and Kavanaughs to the Lou. Some public assurance from MLS would mean a lot right now.There is a tentative timeline, of course. A formal expansion proposal must be submitted. A visit from Garber and fellow MLS decision-makers is in the works. As always, expansion will be on the agenda at the upcoming MLS Board of Governor’s meetings. Ownership group leader Carolyn Kindle Betz has said she hopes the league could officially declare St. Louis as an expansion winner in the first quarter of 2019.A simple question: Why wait?For years, we have heard how the league is itching to call our soccer-rich community home. Finally, the perfect opportunity exists. It took an impressive display of leadership, cooperation and private investment to turn past failures into a chance that should be impossible to slow-play. The ownership group and lawmakers pressed hard to get ahead of the current competition. It worked. The league has granted expansion teams to cities that lack a pitch as appealing as this one. If this really is where MLS wants to be, and this is the deal it wanted, should the same urgency not be shown by the league?
It’s hard to imagine the pot getting sweeter than this. Certain wheels cannot turn until MLS plants its flag. Every day it doesn’t makes you wonder why it won’t.Sharon Tyus, one of two dissenting votes Friday morning, spent a large chunk of time imploring aldermen to hammer down on the details of the stadium lease when — no, if — it comes time to turn the passed resolution into laws.“You try to keep the people away from the table who actually are the biggest critics,” she warned. “Those should be the people who are at the table, helping cut the deals. Because when you have got cheerleaders at the table, they give everything away. The most critical people should be there to make sure we get the best deal for the city of St. Louis.”MLS should hear this message loud and clear. St. Louis wants in, and it has worked to get here, but this remains a region scarred by the NFL’s departure. We are more skeptical, and we should be. We read fine print, and question intent.Nothing is more appealing to our area than a league that wants to help us turn the page. Nothing is less appealing to our area than a league that comes across as standoffish.“MLS is going to be making this decision in the next month or so,” said Alderman Jack Coatar on Friday. “This is by no means a done deal. Even by passing this today, the ownership group still has to go make the pitch to MLS to say, give us the team.”What else needs to be pitched? If the league walks its talk, the competition cannot compare. It would mean a lot hearing it from Garber. The sooner, the better.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Will the poor in Missouri be cut off from benefits if they use medical marijuana? The answer is hazy.,"Nov 29, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/will-the-poor-in-missouri-be-cut-off-from-benefits/article_0a017f4d-6817-5796-b8af-9ddbc9c56361.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Gov. Mike Parson’s administration has not decided whether thousands of Missouri welfare recipients will lose their benefits if they use medical marijuana.The Department of Social Services, which administers the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, or TANF, said the question remains under review.“The Department of Social Services is currently studying the issue and will make a decision on how to proceed at the appropriate time,” spokeswoman Rebecca Woelfel told the Post-Dispatch in response to questions this week.

The agency is not alone in facing a wide array of questions about how to implement a medical marijuana initiative approved by more than 65 percent of voters on Nov. 6.Officials, for example, also have not made decisions on whether to bar medical marijuana users from certain state jobs.Amendment 2 legalizes the cultivation of cannabis, as well as the production of marijuana and marijuana infused products to aid patients suffering from 10 debilitating illnesses, including Parkinson’s, post-traumatic stress disorder, chronic pain, epilepsy, glaucoma and cancer.But, under a 2011 law signed by former Gov. Jay Nixon, the state developed a program to screen TANF applicants for drug use.Under the TANF program, which provides cash benefits to an average of about 25,000 recipients each month, the state requires officials to ask applicants about illegal drug use.Recipients may be then required to take a drug test. If they do not show up for the appointment or do not complete the drug test, they will not receive benefits for themselves for three years.Woelfel did not address the department’s process for adjusting to the new law or how long the review would take.The Department of Corrections had a similar response to questions about rules on medical marijuana use by correctional officers.
“The department has been discussing this issue, of course, but we haven’t proposed any policy changes,” agency spokeswoman Karen Pojmann.Under the new law, consumption of marijuana is prohibited in jails and correctional facilities. Users also are not permitted to operate motor vehicles, boats or aircraft while under the influence.Gary Gross, executive director of the Missouri Correctional Officers Association, said it remains unknown whether someone who has a medical marijuana card would be barred from working at the agency.
“There is just absolutely nothing set in stone,” Gross said.Gross said he doubts whether the union will be able to bargain for the right of officers to use medical marijuana for therapeutic reasons.In Colorado, where recreational marijuana is legal, marijuana use by prospective correctional officers is prohibited.“A pre-employment drug test will be administered at any part of the selection process, and applicants who test positive for any controlled substances, including marijuana, will be disqualified from consideration,” the Colorado prison hiring website notes.In Illinois, a patient seeking a medical marijuana card cannot be an active duty law enforcement officer, correctional officer, correctional probation officer or firefighter, nor can they hold a school bus permit or commercial drivers license.The agency that oversees personnel rules for Missouri’s state government workforce also has not weighed in on how medical marijuana will be viewed during the hiring and employment process.“The Office of Administration is looking into this topic and has not made a determination about policy,” said spokeswoman Brittany Ruess.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri lawmakers to take another crack at legalizing sports betting,"Nov 27, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-lawmakers-to-take-another-crack-at-legalizing-sports-betting/article_cabf03fc-8b82-575e-b27a-76c2349ef549.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Missouri lawmakers are poised to make another run at legalizing sports betting, putting the Show-Me state in line to reap some of the revenue other states are already collecting.Less than six months after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a federal law that had kept most states from allowing wagers on sports, Missouri officials say the House and Senate likely will look at joining at least six other states that have begun offering bets on sporting events.“I certainly anticipate it being out there for discussion before the House and the Senate,” said Rep. Dean Plocher, R-Des Peres, who sponsored legislation last spring that did not advance in either chamber.

Plocher said multiple drafts of legislation have been circulating since the high court issued its decision.“Let’s be honest, the Supreme Court let the cat out of the bag on that one,” Plocher said. “There might as well be some continuity to it in how it’s regulated and enforced.”Casino owners have pushed to legalize sports betting in Missouri, saying it would add $60 million to casino revenue annually, not to mention additional revenue for state coffers.Sen. Denny Hoskins, R-Warrensburg, previously estimated that legalizing sports betting could bring in between $18 million and $40 million in new annual revenue for the state.A spokesman for Gov. Mike Parson said the governor is not leading the charge for bringing sports wagering to Missouri, but he isn’t opposed to it happening.The spokesman also said money generated by gambling is not a replacement for the failure of voters to approve an increase in the gasoline tax that Parson had championed.Rather, money raised by gambling must be spent on educational programs. Under current law, state revenue from casino gambling go to education, as do lottery dollars. Since sports betting would be run by casinos, the revenue would have to go to schools unless the law was changed.Among the sticking points during debate in Jefferson City last spring was a request by the St. Louis Cardinals and the Kansas City Royals for the legislation to include a so-called “integrity fee,” which they said would be used to offset increased expenses that would come with increased betting.The fee, for example, could be used to safeguard games from tampering.
Opponents of such a fee say the leagues will already see more money from an increase in fan interest and engagement.Under legislation debated in a Senate committee last February, representatives of the Cardinals and Major League Baseball expressed support for a proposal that would give them a 1 percent slice of all sports bets placed at the state’s 13 casinos.Plocher believes there should be a fee, but said the trick will be finding a “sweet spot” for both the casinos and the leagues.“It’s not a simple bill,” Plocher said.
Hoskins said the issue of the fees will remain divisive. But he said he will review how other states are handling to find a middle ground.“This being the Show-Me state, we can see what is working and not working,” Hoskins said.Hoskins said he envisions using some of the proceeds of an integrity fee to pay for physical improvements at sports venues.In addition to New Jersey, Delaware, Mississippi, New Mexico, Nevada and West Virginia are receiving revenue from sports wagering.In October, New Jersey reported nearly $600 million had been wagered since sports betting was legalized in mid-June.Missouri is among a handful of states considering legislation, including California, Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan, Rhode Island and South Carolina.In Ohio, Gov.-elect Mike DeWine said it was a question of when, not if, sports betting would be legalized.“It’s coming to Ohio whether people want it or not,” DeWine told News 5 in Cleveland last month. “We need to be there to do it right, the right way.”

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Gov. Mike Parson wants probe of Missouri's public safety department after 'questionable' spending,"Nov 27, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/gov-mike-parson-wants-probe-of-missouri-s-public-safety/article_1e8a2a89-b9b8-5d92-9618-d60cd1da526f.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Gov. Mike Parson on Tuesday asked state Auditor Nicole Galloway to audit the state Department of Public Safety director's office after the agency's new director uncovered ""questionable"" spending when she took the job.Parson, a Republican, in August appointed then-Missouri Highway Patrol Col. Sandra Karsten to lead the Department of Public Safety. Karsten replaced then-Director Drew Juden, who was appointed by former Gov. Eric Greitens, a Republican.Parson ousted Juden in August. Parson's spokeswoman said then that the new chief executive, himself a former sheriff, wanted to move the department in a different direction. The Parson administration did not elaborate at the time.

Karsten, in a statement on Tuesday, said the state Office of Administration reviewed the department's director's office after she started in August. ""Our initial review raised concerns that warranted a more in-depth examination of past public safety administration practices,” Karsten said.She said the state auditor had not assessed the director's office in five years.""A state audit is the appropriate next step to ensure the DPS Director’s office is fulfilling its obligations to the people of Missouri,"" Karsten said.Parson, in a statement on Tuesday, expressed vague concerns about ""questionable use of taxpayer dollars,"" but did not elaborate.“Anytime a department director raises concerns about questionable use of taxpayer dollars, we take them very seriously — that’s why under these circumstances we have requested a state audit,” he said. “Director Karsten is doing a great job leading DPS and has a clear understanding about the importance of keeping government accountable to the people of Missouri.”Parson sent a formal letter to Galloway, a Democrat. The three-paragraph letter offers no other details on potential malfeasance within the office.
""Upon review of the Governor's request, I have committed to performing an independent audit of the administrative practices of the Department of Public Safety,"" Galloway said in a statement, adding that people with information can contact the auditor's whistleblower hotline.The Department of Public Safety, with 15,000 employees, oversees eight agencies, including the highway patrol, Capitol Police, Fire Safety, Missouri National Guard, Alcohol & Tobacco Control, State Emergency Management Agency, Veterans Commission and Gaming Commission.
Juden's ousting was Parson's first major staff shake-up after Parson took office in June. Prior to joining Greitens’ administration, Juden oversaw both the police and fire departments in Sikeston, population 16,000. He also is a former president of the Missouri Police Chiefs Association.Juden, who has worked in law enforcement for more than 40 years, came under fire last summer when Greitens said Juden had investigated problems at the St. Louis Veterans Home and found no issues.After outcry by then-Lt. Gov. Parson, residents, families and lawmakers, Greitens led a major shakeup of the agency that oversees the home.As a Sikeston police officer, Juden also was involved in a botched case that garnered attention earlier this year.In August 2000, Juden was the arresting officer when David Robinson was charged with the murder of Sheila Box. Juden also supervised the detective who put together the case that led to Robinson being convicted.This year, however, the Missouri Supreme Court ruled that Robinson should be released from prison after 16 years because of serious questions about the case, including witnesses that recanted their testimony.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Editorial: Missouri should make the anti-transparency Confide app disappear once and for all,"Nov 27, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-missouri-should-make-the-anti-transparency-confide-app-disappear/article_15fbc2d5-4892-59a4-9ed1-792799286f00.html,"Once again, the text-scrubbing app Confide is in the news in Missouri, this time with the revelation that a top aide to the state’s incoming attorney general downloaded it and may have used it to communicate with associates of former Gov. Eric Greitens.Confide is a mobile phone application that automatically deletes text messages after they’re read, preventing records from being kept and enabling users in government positions to evade the state’s Sunshine Law. Greitens, whose instincts for inappropriate secrecy were obvious throughout his short political career, used it with members of his staff.The issue spawned litigation and debate over whether destroying officials’ text exchanges in real time violates public records laws. We believe it clearly does. Gov. Mike Parson, who last week pledged to abide by high standards of ethics and transparency, should use this latest revelation to establish, by law, that Confide has no place in governmental communications.

Despite rapidly changing technology for communications, some legal standards should remain consistent, including the principle that government officials’ on-the-job communications — whether typed, texted, handwritten, carrier-pigeoned or whatever — must be preserved because they are potentially subject to public review.Greitens seldom paused to consider such principles. After winning office in 2016 with a campaign steeped in dark money, his short tenure as governor was marked by a level of secrecy unprecedented in modern times. It wasn’t terribly surprising when The Kansas City Star reported in December 2017 that Greitens and his top staff were communicating via the smartphone equivalent of disappearing ink.
Greitens, under pressure, banned Confide from his office, though subsequent reporting found he and others kept the app on their phones, leaving open the question of whether they actually stopped using it. Attorney General Josh Hawley investigated and found no evidence of wrongdoing — which, of course, is the whole point of using Confide in the first place: to erase the evidence.
Hawley has been elected to the U.S. Senate, and Parson has appointed state Treasurer Eric Schmitt to become attorney general in January. In the latest twist, the Post-Dispatch’s Jack Suntrup reported that Andrew Dziedzic — a former member of Greitens’ transition team and now Schmitt’s chief of staff — had the Confide app on his phone in 2017, and records indicate he may have used it to communicate with other Greitens associates.This, too, isn’t evidence of wrongdoing. But it presents an opportunity for both Schmitt and Parson — who just last week signed an executive order imposing tougher ethical standards on his administration — to push for legislation officially banning Confide and apps like it from all governmental communications.A legislative attempt at such a law this year vanished like a Confide text. But with these two prominent voices behind it, the message could get through next time."
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Editorial: Thanksgiving toasts to good works by good people,"Nov 21, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-thanksgiving-toasts-to-good-works-by-good-people/article_3374f5db-763f-59c8-87ed-9417b35c03dc.html,"The Thanksgiving table is traditionally the place where friends and family gather to take stock of their blessings and appreciate all the ways, big and small, that we make life better for one another. Out there in the wider world, first responders, homemakers, artists, military service members, office workers and, yes, even politicians have had a positive impact on the lives of people around them. Though we’ve expressed appreciation to many of them before, it’s time to raise a glass in praise of good works and offer our Thanksgiving toasts …To St. Louis Fire Capt. Leon Whitener and 29 of his colleagues at the fire department, whose heroics were recently honored by Gov. Mike Parson, for exemplifying the kinds of quick thinking and self-sacrifice that save lives and keep our communities safe. Whitener was driving home from work on April 22 when alerted to a nearby fire that had trapped a wheelchair-bound woman inside. Whitener, assisted by civilian Raymond Rayford, rushed into the blaze and carried the woman to safety.To the staff of the Capital Gazette in Annapolis, Md., which rallied after a deadly shooting in their offices in June. A gunman with a vendetta entered the newspaper building and killed five employees with a shotgun. Surviving members of the staff, steeping in grief, stayed on the job and covered the story like the professionals they are.

To Kate Wynja and Kaiden Whaley, two young athletes whose conduct in competition should serve as inspiration to other youths and a valuable lesson to adults about the importance of prioritizing character over the blind pursuit of victory. Wynja, a star golfer on her South Dakota high school golf team, led her teammates to two Class A state championship finals. On their second try at the state title, scorekeepers had under-counted the number of strokes Wynja had taken on one hole in the final round. She didn’t notice the error until after she had signed and turned in her scorecard. No one else did, either. She could’ve kept quiet and retained the individual and team championship. Instead, she spoke up and acknowledged the mistake, knowing the error would disqualify her and bump her team out of the championship. Winning wasn’t the important thing for Wynja; honesty was. Whaley was the goalie for his junior hockey team near Washington, D.C. The opposing team’s goalie couldn’t make the game. They had to sub a 10-year-old forward, Leopold Hylton — who had never played goalie in his life — in a game against Whaley’s team. In the first period, Hylton gave up seven goals. When the period was over, Whaley skipped the break with his team and, without consulting his coach, skated over to Hylton, where he conducted a crash course in goalkeeping. The lesson proved valuable. Hylton survived the next two periods, giving up “only” four more goals. It wasn’t winning that counted for either. It was all about being good sports. Wynja and Whaley were honored at Saturday’s Musial Awards in St. Louis.To John “J.K.” Reed, believed to be the last Missouri veteran to have survived the 1941 Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Reed, of Troy, was eating breakfast when the attack began. He and other enlistees grabbed the only weapons they could find — service rifles — and began firing skyward in a desperate but futile attempt to ward off the attack. He served until 1945 in the Pacific, surviving mines at sea and repeated kamikaze attacks. He died Nov. 12, one week before his 97th birthday.
To Walter Carr, the 20-year-old college student who walked 20 miles overnight to make his first day on the job at Alabama’s Bellhop moving company after his car broke down; and to police who came across him and bought him breakfast; and to Bellhop CEO Luke Marklin, who gave Carr his personal car to reward his admirable work ethic.
To Howard Brown, football and life coach at McCluer South-Berkeley High school, for his efforts beyond the call of duty to provide love, structure and guidance to the at-risk students on his team in the Ferguson-Florissant community. As was noted when his team received a $25,000 donation in honor of his efforts, Brown has used his own money to supply food, clean uniforms and gear for his players. Football talent isn’t the top priority to make the team, he says, asking them only to be “good citizens, good people, good students.”To Aretha Franklin, the Queen of Soul. The woman Rolling Stone magazine praised as “one of the greatest singers of all time” was much more than that: musical pioneer, civil rights activist, feminist icon for decades.

Franklin, 76, died Aug. 16.To Southwest Airlines pilot Tammie Jo Shults, who kept a cool head after an engine exploded and blew a hole in the cabin of the Boeing 737 plane she was commanding. One passenger was killed after being partially sucked out of the hole. The deafening roar inside the cockpit forced Shults and her co-pilot, Darren Ellisor, to communicate by hand signals. Despite chaos all around her, Shults calmly guided the plane through a harrowing 32,500-foot descent, landing it and saving the lives of all but one of the 149 people on board.To the dead and the survivors of the mass shootings in 2018: Parkland, Fla.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Top aide to Greitens looks to national role,"Nov 21, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/top-aide-to-greitens-looks-to-national-role/article_70f6333a-128e-5176-9fb7-8ba3faf0b9cb.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Former Gov. Eric Greitens’ top campaign consultant is hoping to become the next chief of the Republican Governors Association.Austin Chambers, who steered the political newcomer into the governor’s office in the 2016 election, told the Post-Dispatch he had thrown his name into the mix to take over for RGA Executive Director Paul Bennecke.“They have an open application process where anyone interested who meets the criteria can apply. I have applied,” Chambers said in a text message.

Chambers, 23, is coming off of a narrow victory as a top campaign aide to Georgia Gov.-elect Brian Kemp, who beat former state Senate Minority Leader Stacey Abrams in a nationally watched race.If Chambers gets the new post, he would continue a tradition of Georgians leading the RGA.Vice President Mike Pence’s chief of staff, Nick Ayers, formerly served as the executive director, along with Bennecke. Ayers also worked on Greitens’ campaign.All are close allies.In addition, the RGA’s chief legal counsel, Michael Adams, serves as an attorney for the controversial nonprofit Chambers established to promote Greitens’ agenda.The organization, known as A New Missouri, accepts dark money contributions and is based in the same office building as Greitens’ former campaign operation.
For Chambers, the new post would take him out of the hands-on campaign work he’s done since he was a teenager.In 2013, Bennecke recruited Chambers to serve as the political director for the Senate campaign of Georgia Republican David Perdue, who won the seat in 2014.Chambers joined forces with Greitens in 2015 at age 20.
In managing Greitens’ bid for governor, Chambers oversaw a campaign in which Greitens cast himself as an outsider in both the primary and the general election.The narrative, fueled by $13 million in contributions from the RGA, worked well in a year when Missouri voters gave Donald Trump a 19-point victory over Hillary Clinton.Despite not winning endorsements from key GOP-leaning groups such as the National Rifle Association and the Missouri Farm Bureau, Greitens beat Democrat Attorney General Chris Koster by a six-point margin, 51 percent to 45 percent.After holding 33 governorships coming out of the 2016 election, the RGA had a challenging election cycle in 2018, losing six seats.It was not immediately clear when the RGA would hire the new director.“The interview process with the panel of governors hasn’t begun yet,” Chambers said.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri school board rehires commissioner ousted by Greitens allies last year,"Nov 21, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/education/missouri-school-board-rehires-commissioner-ousted-by-greitens-allies-last/article_923f9c3b-1e4a-50b3-b7a1-da1b62b2b481.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • In a stinging rebuke to former Gov. Eric Greitens, Missouri education officials are rehiring the commissioner who was ousted from her job last year.Margie Vandeven, who was dismissed last year by a board that had been revamped by Greitens, will resume the $191,544 post she had held since 2015, officials said Tuesday.“It is an honor to return to the department, and I remain committed to doing what is best for the children of Missouri. I look forward to working with stakeholders from across our state — urban, rural and suburban. Through active collaboration among state and local leaders, educators and our families, we will — together — advance opportunities for each student,” Vandeven said in a statement.

Vandeven was among four finalists for the position, which had been vacant since December after Greitens’ failed attempt to bring in his own candidate to lead the 1,650-employee agency.The scandal-plagued ex-governor spent much of last year stacking the school board with his own appointees. Without any public explanation, the new board members then moved to fire Vandeven, despite her receiving high marks from school advocates and other education observers.The board, however, was unable to hire a replacement after members of the state Senate – angered by the governor’s actions — blocked the confirmation of the appointees, leaving the board with too few members to officially meet.After Greitens’ hasty departure, Gov. Mike Parson nominated new board members who were not opposed during a less-confrontational Senate confirmation process.In a statement, Parson highlighted that Vandeven was chosen by an “independent” state board.“Moving forward, we will continue working with Missouri’s Department of Elementary and Secondary Education to focus efforts on ensuring our students have the skills to succeed and meet the demands of tomorrow’s workforce,” Parson said.Vandeven’s rehiring comes after a monthlong application process drew five applications and seven nominations. Vandeven said she was among those nominated.The board winnowed that down to four with an eye on getting the new commissioner on board in January and agreed on Vandeven after a 90-minute interview with her on Monday.Other candidates included Rockwood School District Superintendent Eric Knost, who is retiring from the St. Louis County district at the end of the school year.
“We were blessed with really great candidates,” said school board President Charlie Shields.Shields said Greitens was not a factor in the hiring process.“This was never about righting a wrong,” Shields said. “This was about the ability to continue to move the state forward when it came to education.”“I really don’t hold any grudges at this point,” Vandeven added. “I plan to hit the ground running.”
Vandeven launched her career in 1990 as a communication arts teacher in private schools in St. Charles County. From 1995-2002 she taught high school English and served as an administrator in Maryland, before returning to Missouri as an English teacher and administrator.She started in the state’s top post in January 2015.Vandeven had been working in the private sector as director of educational partnerships for the SAS Institute.Roger Dorson, interim commissioner, has led the department since December.“I want to thank Roger for his amazing leadership during a challenging time as well as express my appreciation to the education community for its support,” Shields said. “We look forward to continuous progress for the department under Margie’s leadership.”School advocates also signaled their support of the move.“The State Board of Education has made an excellent choice to rehire Dr. Margie Vandeven as commissioner of education. Dr. Vandeven has a proven track record of effective leadership for both the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education and for public education in Missouri,” said Melissa Randol, executive director of the Missouri School Boards’ Association."

Baker has been an administrative law judge in St. Louis County for two years.
He is a graduate of the University of Michigan in 1990 and the University of Missouri-Columbia School of Law in 1993. From 1994-1999, he was an assistant public defender in St. Louis.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Editorial: Light at the end of the dark tunnel where Greitens left Missouri schools,"Nov 20, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-light-at-the-end-of-the-dark-tunnel-where/article_d3e6ecf2-0a0e-57a8-837d-b82d41f7d317.html,"Gov. Mike Parson has been very clear about his major legislative goals heading into 2019, with workforce development ranking among his highest priority items. He can make no bolder step toward improving employers’ workforce choices than by getting the state’s public schools back on track after the damage inflicted by disgraced former Gov. Eric Greitens.Margie Vandeven was the person spearheading that effort long before Parson took over from the scandal-plagued Greitens. But Greitens, seemingly hellbent on making a mess of everything he touched, decided to force Vandeven out as the state’s school commissioner. On Tuesday, she was rehired for the job she never should have been forced to leave.Greitens meddled where he had no business tinkering. The state school board was designed to be an independent, bipartisan, consensus-building group whose goals were supposed to supersede political agendas and focus solely on giving Missouri children the best education they could receive.

Despite Vandeven’s superior qualifications and high praise from education professionals, Greitens wanted to put his own stamp on public education. He never publicly explained his reasoning or legal justification since the governor has no power over who gets the job. But to get what he wanted, he tried to stack the state board with loyalists who would vote Vandeven out.As we wrote almost exactly one year ago, Greitens handled this issue exactly like the neophyte, inexperienced politician he was. Someone with political experience would’ve been skilled in the art of persuasion, compromise and negotiation to get what he wanted. Instead, Greitens drew on the only background he knew, as a former Navy SEAL, and attempted to muscle his way to victory. The result was an unmitigated disaster, which Parson inherited and is methodically working to correct.
After waiting for the 2017 legislative session to end, Greitens engineered a series of interim appointments to the school board. He threatened appointees who wouldn’t do his bidding. Friends of big donors took priority as appointees even if they had no interest or track record in public education. As pressure intensified to get rid of Vandeven, some appointees declined to serve or withdrew from consideration.
This game of musical chairs went on and on for months. This year, the Senate refused to confirm Greitens’ appointees, leaving in limbo a body that oversees about 900,000 K-12 students, including the roughly 24,000 attending St. Louis Public Schools.One of the state board’s unfinished items of business is setting the timetable for St. Louis schools to transition from appointed to elected governance. A long-awaited evaluation system for statewide school performance also is due. None of this can happen as long as the board and its commissioner remain in flux.Vandeven is an excellent choice to bring the state’s education needs into closer alignment with Parson’s priorities."
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Parson alters lobbyist gift ban rules imposed by Greitens,"Nov 20, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/parson-alters-lobbyist-gift-ban-rules-imposed-by-greitens/article_13807e22-2c47-5089-b841-250950ddf24e.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Gov. Mike Parson tweaked an order issued by his predecessor that could bring an end to a federal lawsuit over a ban on gifts from lobbyists.In a rewrite of an executive order issued by former Gov. Eric Greitens on the day he took office in 2017, Parson Tuesday altered a section that prohibited executive branch employees from accepting gifts.The new wording, which adopts descriptions found in existing law, could allow groups like a Virginia-based law firm to distribute informational books to employees of the governor’s office.

In October, the libertarian-leaning Institute for Justice said the Greitens-era ban on gift-giving violates the organization’s First Amendment rights to free speech because it prohibits them from giving workers in Parson’s office two books.Administration officials said Parson wanted to keep the ban in place, but also to bring it in line with existing statutes that allow for the distribution of “informational materials.”“During my tenure in public service, I’ve seen the good and bad in how our government works,” Parson said. “There are always areas of improvement, ways to do better and hard lessons learned. This administration will always strive to uphold the highest ethical standards.”
For years, state lawmakers have been unable to agree on regulations that could end or put limits on freebies handed out by lobbyists.In response, Greitens issued his original executive order on his first day in office in 2017.
On Nov. 6, Missouri voters voted to impose limits on lawmakers receiving gifts. The $5 threshold for expenditures made by lobbyists, however, only applies to members of the House and Senate, not to members of the executive branch.In addition to altering the gift ban language, Parson renewed a provision that bars his employees from going to work as lobbyists while he is in office.“Missourians expect and deserve that elected officials, like myself, and all public servants conduct themselves with integrity, provide transparency and uphold the rule of law,” Parson added.Attempts to reach a representative of the institute were not successful Tuesday. Court records show attorneys issued a summons for Parson on Nov. 1. The governor must respond to the summons by early December.

Eric Greitens’ ill-fated push to install his own state school commissioner may be on track to get her old job back.Margie Vandeven, who was dismissed last year by a school board that the scandal-plagued governor had stacked with his own appointees, was among four finalists interviewing for the post Monday.Vandeven confirmed she was seeking her old job as she entered a closed meeting of the board before 3 p.m. for an interview.

“That’s what we’re here to find out,” Vandeven said.Board President Charlie Shields said the board made a unanimous decision Monday to hire one of the candidates after spending about 90 minutes with each of them.An announcement, pending an acceptance of the $191,544 per year job, is expected Tuesday.Sources said Vandeven likely has the inside track because of her experience running the agency.Vandeven’s reappearance in the offices of the board comes after a year of turmoil set in motion by Greitens.Greitens, who resigned under a cloud in June, spent much of last year stacking the board with his own appointees. They then moved to fire Vandeven, who had received high marks from education advocates and other education observers.














        
            Governor finally fires Missouri's schools boss

Eric Greitens named five new people to the education board in the past four months so he could get rid of Margie Vandeven.  




Greitens’ appointees then attempted to rush through the hiring of a replacement. But members of the state Senate who were angry over Greitens’ meddling with the independent board blocked the confirmation of the appointees, leaving the board unable to meet.Greitens’ replacement, Gov. Mike Parson, nominated new board members who were not opposed during a less confrontational Senate confirmation process.
The search for a new commissioner got underway in October, when a month-long application period drew five résumés and seven nominations.The board winnowed that down to four with an eye on getting the new commissioner on board in January.To qualify, the candidates must have a doctorate. The commissioner oversees an agency with about 1,650 employees, who monitor the state’s 518 school districts.Vandeven said she did not send in an application, but rather was nominated.
Vandeven began her education career in 1990 as a communication arts teacher in O’Fallon. From 1995-2002 she taught high school English and served as an administrator in Maryland, before returning to Missouri as an English teacher and administrator.She started in the top post in January 2015.Roger Dorson, interim commissioner, has led the department since December.Shields has praised Dorson for his leadership and said the board could opt to remove the “interim” tag from Dorson’s title.Another finalist, Rockwood School District Superintendent Eric Knost, interviewed with the board after lunch Monday.In October, Knost announced his retirement after 31 years in public education.Knost, 53, has been at the helm of the west St. Louis County district — the third largest in the state — since 2014.The name of the other finalist was not available."

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Editorial: Cracks on I-44, and in the funding structure for Missouri highways","Nov 15, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-cracks-on-i--and-in-the-funding-structure/article_9e575e3d-db0b-527d-bfc3-3767d871b82b.html,"Drivers who regularly use the stretch of Interstate 44 between Shrewsbury and Hampton avenues have every reason to be outraged by the appearance of cracks on a newly renovated overpass that was only reopened a year ago. Can Missouri taxpayers return it and get their money back?A few cracks are normal. The unusual number of cracks in this project is a clear sign of a botched job. The Missouri Department of Transportation was quick on Tuesday to note that the cracks are barely the thickness of a credit card, as if to suggest that there’s nothing for folks to worry about. But if the words of Tom Blair, the district engineer for MoDOT, are to be taken seriously, there’s plenty to worry about.“I’ve never seen anything like this in my 25 years at MoDOT,” he told the Post-Dispatch’s Mark Schlinkmann.

As if to underscore the seriousness, westbound I-44 between Hampton and Shrewsbury avenues will have to shut down this weekend so work crews can seal the cracks. At the same time, major ongoing work on the eastbound half of I-44, just east of Shrewsbury, will force traffic down to the use of a single lane. The inconvenience to truckers and travelers will be unfathomable.Anyone who regularly drives this stretch in either direction can attest to the massive inconvenience resulting from years of much-needed upgrades to improve safety and reverse the steady deterioration that accompanies aging infrastructure. But the renewed and reopened parts were never supposed to be part of this plan. Someone screwed up, big time.
The contractor in question, KCI Construction, wasn’t responding to requests for comment. KCI and its subcontractors are receiving $16 million for the upgrade project’s bridge and paving work.
Despite justifiable public frustration, perhaps this is the time to consider the compromises MoDOT is being forced to make as the state’s road and bridge infrastructure deteriorates while funding fails to keep pace. Highway maintenance has been funded through a 17 cents-per-gallon fuel tax that has not been increased in two decades. The Legislature has consistently punted when presented with the cold, hard financial facts about the state’s pressing infrastructure needs.The Nov. 6 election was Missourians’ last great hope for a solution. Ballot Proposition D would have raised the fuel tax by 10 cents over four years to fund those infrastructure improvements. It had Gov. Mike Parson’s strong support, yet it failed — almost certainly because it was badly worded.The cracks on I-44 require investigation and public answers from all responsible parties. But the symbolism of their discovery, just as the Prop D vote was being decided, shouldn’t be lost on anyone. Rest assured, there will be far more cracks and far greater inconveniences to come unless the state comes up with a long-term funding answer."
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Schatz, Legislature take aim at undoing amendment","Nov 15, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/mailbag/schatz-legislature-take-aim-at-undoing-amendment/article_7fade9dc-8b73-560e-8428-df781025078c.html,"The editorial ""Missouri's new agenda"" (Nov. 13) lauds Gov. Mike Parson's and new Senate President Pro Tem Dave Schatz's desire for conciliatory politics. But Schatz's record on workforce development, for example, is well-defined by his support for ""right to work"" and lowering Missouri prevailing wages.Also of concern is Schatz's dislike for the ""Clean Missouri"" amendment. The editorial noted that Schatz ""has made  clear he's no fan of the ... proposition to reduce lobbyist influence and revise the way legislative districts are drawn."" This is not surprising, given his leadership in accepting lobbyist gifts; he's currently No. 2 on the list.

According to the Missouri Ethics Commission website, Schatz has garnered $12,400 in gifts, including $800 to see the Missouri vs. Illinois basketball game last year and $450 for two Cardinals games and $400 for three rounds of golf just this year. Two years ago, he took a nearly $4,000 all-expenses-paid trip to Israel on the cuff of a St. Louis religious organization. Nice work if you can get it.
According to the Post-Dispatch (""Challenge likely for ethics overhaul,"" Nov. 12), Schatz said of the ""Clean Missouri"" initiative, ""I think it's a major concern."" The article noted the amendment would ""limit lobbyist gifts to no more than $5."" So, unless he takes immediate action, it looks like Schatz will be watching the Cardinals next year from the bleachers instead of the executive suites.
While Missouri amendments are guidelines to craft laws, the Legislature also has some authority to undo them. Remember the gambling revenue that could only go to schools? They found a way around that. Now, some legislators (like Schatz) and lobbyist groups (like the Missouri Chamber of Commerce) are ready to undo the ""Clean Missouri"" amendment.Terry Beckmeyer  •  New Haven"
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Parson making it official: Guns OK in Missouri Capitol,"Nov 15, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/parson-making-it-official-guns-ok-in-missouri-capitol/article_0c70c681-7521-5ff1-b23e-f43c633ecd78.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Gov. Mike Parson’s administration is poised to make it official: Visitors can bring guns into the Missouri Capitol if they have a concealed carry permit.Nearly two years after Parson’s predecessor, Eric Greitens, temporarily barred most visitors and employees from bringing concealed firearms into the Capitol, Parson’s administration has proposed a rule change that would make it clear that guns are allowed, as long as they are not brought into the House or Senate chambers or into committee meetings.The issue has been in limbo since the 2017 transition from former Gov. Jay Nixon, a Democrat, to Greitens, a Republican.

Soon after taking office, Greitens prohibited guns in the building, sparking an outcry among some lawmakers.Rep. Nick Marshall, a Republican from Platte County, for example, said the ban infringed on the rights and freedoms of visitors to the Capitol.After the prohibition went into effect, Marshall erected a sign on his office door in the Capitol offering to lend guns to people while they visit the building.Greitens, who left office under the cloud of scandal on June 1, reversed course a month later and said guns would be OK if the owners had permits.That decision raised eyebrows among lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, as well as gun control advocates.
For example, although visitors must pass through metal detectors to gain entry into the building, there are no law enforcement personnel checking to see if people with weapons are going into committee hearings or the House and Senate chambers.“I am concerned about that,” Sen. Shalonn “Kiki” Curls, D-Kansas City, said at the time.
An estimated 200 members of the Missouri chapter of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America also called on members of the House and Senate to reject the changes.The change by Parson is not a surprise. As a former sheriff from Polk County, he has received perfect or near-perfect ratings from the National Rifle Association. As a legislator, Parson co-sponsored an expansion of Missouri's ""castle doctrine"" law, which allows individuals to use deadly force in defense of their homes.The rule change is being proposed by the Office of Administration. Anyone may file a statement in support or opposition to the amendment within the next 30 days.No public hearing on the change is scheduled.

Mike Parson.The honor lauds higher ranking officers who have improved safety and cooperation by trying to reduce the gulf that often exists between police and residents.

Mininni, who became head of the Normandy department 22 years after joining the force, started a community engagement program in the city involving patrol officers, and also created a lunch program in which officers eat lunch at local schools and talk to students.
In 2015, the department got an $800,000 federal grant to put school resource officers back into Normandy schools.
Mininni was awarded the Director's Leadership Medal by Parson at a ceremony Monday at Harris-Stowe State University.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,State Treasurer Eric Schmitt to become Missouri AG after Hawley's election to U.S. Senate,"Nov 13, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/state-treasurer-eric-schmitt-to-become-missouri-ag-after-hawley/article_aaa317fe-6919-5fe8-b48b-9b0a738fea37.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Gov. Mike Parson on Tuesday announced that state Treasurer Eric Schmitt would become Missouri attorney general when current Attorney General Josh Hawley resigns in January to become a U.S. senator.Schmitt, a Republican, earned his law degree from the St. Louis University School of Law in 2000. He served two terms in the state Senate representing parts of west St. Louis County, and was a partner at the Lathrop Gage law firm until being sworn in as state treasurer in 2017.“We have discussed many qualified candidates,” Parson, a Republican, told reporters in his Capitol office on Tuesday morning. “But in the end, it was important to appoint someone who has already been thoroughly vetted by the people of Missouri.”

Schmitt, 43, will take over as attorney general after a two-year period of flux within the agency. Hawley reorganized the attorney general’s office when he took over in January 2017, but critics say the agency has been plagued by high turnover and low morale with Hawley at the helm.Hawley, a Republican who defeated Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill on Nov. 6, came into office without the Missouri connections of past attorneys general. Before taking a job as a University of Missouri associate law professor in 2011, Hawley worked in Washington.Schmitt, on the other hand, has Capitol connections as well as roots within the St. Louis legal community. State Rep. Gina Mitten, D-Richmond Heights, said she and Schmitt both worked at the now-defunct Blumenthal, Kaplan & Sandweiss law firm in the early 2000s.“Aside from our ideological differences, I think that he would do a good job,” Mitten said. “Eric is an attorney that is respected within our community.”Schmitt was one of Hawley’s most visible surrogates during Hawley’s U.S. Senate campaign. He served as the honorary chairman of the Missouri Rising super PAC, which worked to elect Hawley.Joplin businessman David Humphreys gave nearly $1.17 million to the group this past election cycle, according to Open Secrets. Humphreys also supported Hawley’s bid for attorney general.Last Monday, Schmitt told the Post-Dispatch he was not lobbying for an appointment.“I’m focused on getting Josh elected,” Schmitt said.Hawley on Tuesday congratulated Schmitt on Twitter, calling Schmitt “a constitutional conservative” with “a proven track record of standing up for taxpayers & citizens.”
Congrats to @Eric_Schmitt on his appointment as the next AG of Missouri! The AG’s job is to fight for the people MO, and I know @Eric_Schmitt will dedicate himself to this work. He is a constitutional conservative w/ a proven track record of standing up for taxpayers &  citizens— Josh Hawley (@HawleyMO) November 13, 2018

Schmitt will be the state’s top law enforcer and will have wide latitude to initiate inquiries and file lawsuits. He said it was too early to say whether he would continue Missouri’s participation in a lawsuit challenging the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.The attorney general’s office also has ongoing inquiries into Google, Facebook and possible Catholic clergy sex abuse. The office has filed a host of lawsuits in recent months, including a lawsuit against the St. Louis Housing Authority and another filed against Branson Duck Boats and Ripley Entertainment after a deadly accident on Table Rock lake this summer.The attorney general’s office handles thousands of matters at any given time, ranging from enforcement of environmental laws to processing of consumer complaints. The office also acts as special prosecutor when local prosecutors request aid, and handles criminal appeals.“I’m committed to being an attorney general who listens,” Schmitt said Tuesday. “Gov. Parson has been a champion of transparency in the governor’s office. It is a commitment that I share and intend to bring that same commitment to this office as well.“Everyone in this state deserves to feel safe,” Schmitt said. “And our kids have a right to grow up and pursue their dreams without fear of violence.”In the state Senate, where he served from 2009 to 2017, Schmitt sponsored legislation after the 2014 Ferguson protests aimed at stopping St. Louis County police departments from aggressively issuing traffic tickets to raise revenue. Schmitt called the practice “taxation by citation.”Traffic citations in St. Louis County have dropped in the post-Ferguson era, after the passage of Senate Bill 5. Schmitt sponsored another bill in 2016 designed to stop municipalities from raking in revenue from nuisance violations.“In that effort we created a broad coalition to fight the abusive, revenue-generating schemes where some cities treated citizens as nothing more than ATMs,” Schmitt said. “I’ll bring the undying commitment I brought to that fight to the attorney general’s office and ensure we honor the rule of law with justice and fairness for all.”

Schmitt lives in Glendale with his wife, Jaime, and three children, Stephen, Sophia and Olivia. In the Legislature, Schmitt said he was motivated by Stephen to work on certain bills.Stephen was born with a genetic condition that causes tumors on his organs. Stephen also is on the autism spectrum and has epilepsy.In 2010, the Legislature approved a bill Schmitt supported that requires insurance companies to cover autism treatments. In 2014, Schmitt backed the first major loosening of Missouri’s marijuana laws, allowing children with epilepsy to access nonintoxicating oil derived from cannabis.When Hawley was inaugurated, he eliminated the agency’s environmental and agricultural division, raising eyebrows among former agency attorneys who said the division dealt with some of the state’s most complicated cases.Hawley also formed a Federalism Unit specifically to sue the federal government, something recent Democratic attorneys general did not emphasize.The Post-Dispatch reported in October that under Hawley’s leadership, experienced litigators departed and other staffers bolted from the attorney general’s office at a steady clip, even after the so-called transition phase of his administration.
Schmitt said he had not yet made decisions about the organization of the office. He also said he plans to reside in Jefferson City. Hawley did not move to the capital city when he took office, in possible violation of the law. He did lease an apartment in Jefferson City after the Post-Dispatch reported the issue.At 43, Schmitt will be the second-youngest state officeholder in Jefferson City after Auditor Nicole Galloway, who is 36. Schmitt is also the tallest state officeholder. He stands 6 feet 6 inches tall.A St. Louis County native, he graduated from De Smet Jesuit High School and Truman State University.By appointing Schmitt, Parson also gets to appoint a new state treasurer. It was unclear Tuesday whom he would choose.Because of the rejiggering of state offices, come January, four of six statewide offices will be filled by people who were not elected to their particular position. Parson, who was elected lieutenant governor in 2016, took over for scandal-plagued Gov. Eric Greitens when Greitens resigned in June.Parson appointed then-state Sen. Mike Kehoe, R-Jefferson City, to be lieutenant governor. The only office holders who have won their seats at the ballot box are Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft, a Republican elected in 2016, and Galloway, a Democrat who won a full term as auditor last Tuesday.Galloway is the only Democrat left in statewide office.Meanwhile, at least one Democrat is already angling to take Schmitt on in 2020, assuming Schmitt runs to keep his new job. Elad Gross, a St. Louis attorney and former assistant attorney general, announced on Monday that he intends to seek the Democratic nomination.Gross has yet to form a campaign committee. Schmitt had just under $350,000 in his campaign coffers as of Oct. 1.Gross in June sued A New Missouri, a nonprofit allied with Greitens, after the group declined to turn over financial records to Gross, a private citizen. Cole County Circuit Judge Jon E. Beetem sided with Greitens’ attorneys last week, saying Gross did not have the right to inspect the records.Gross has said Hawley’s office should investigate A New Missouri under the state’s consumer protection and anti-fraud statutes. Hawley has not done so, saying that the Missouri Ethics Commission is investigating.Hawley also has declined to update the public on two other investigations: one having to do with whether Greitens used taxpayer resources for political gain, and the other relating to Greitens’ ties with his former charity, The Mission Continues.Mary Compton, spokeswoman for the attorney general’s office, said in a statement on Friday that both investigations were “ongoing.” She did not elaborate.It is unclear how Schmitt will handle lingering controversy from the Greitens era.Editor's note: a previous version of this article misstated the amount of money Humphreys donated to the Missouri Rising Action super PAC.

Mike Parson to salute their lifesaving efforts.At a ceremony Tuesday at Harris-Stowe State University, Parson awarded a Medal of Valor to St. Louis Fire Capt. Leon Whitener III and a Civilian Partnership Award to Raymond Rayford for their heroics in April 2017.Whitener was driving home after work on April 22 when he heard a scanner call for a fire that had trapped a person in a building in the 4100 block of McRee Avenue, according to the fire department.

Being close, Whitener drove to the scene and immediately ran into the burning building. Rayford, who had been outside the building with a growing crowd, ran in behind Whitener.The pair found a woman who uses a wheelchair trapped inside and then carried her to safety.
The other 29 members of the St. Louis Fire Department honored Tuesday were lauded for their work on Jan. 24, 2017, when they rescued people from a fire in the 4600 block of Evans Avenue that left 11 injured.
On arrival, firefighters saw heavy smoke pouring from the building. Firefighters forced their way in and found eight people in a back bedroom. They carried the children out, and helped guide the adults down the stairs.At the time, Fire Chief Dennis Jenkerson said the quick first response, in less than four minutes, saved lives. ""A minute longer and we'd be having a totally different conversation — and it wouldn't have been a good conversation,"" he said.Honored for their actions related to Evans were: Battalion Chief Gary Steffens; Capts. Larry Conley, Michael Hostetler, Bryan Radley and Joe Waring; Privates Louis Bollasina, Paul Clark, Marquis Hayes, Joe Johnson, Tim Mahnken, Patrick O'Brien, Patrick Pollihan, James Reynolds, Dave Ray, Jeff Ronshausen, Dale Schultz, Tim Schultz, Galen Taylor, John Vallero, paramedic supervisor Colin McCoy; paramedics Daniel Goldfeld; Dustin Lammert; Cameron Morton and James Wilson; EMTs Andrew Beasley; Antuan Knox; Nicholas Spiess and Norman Walker; and dispatcher Angela Williams.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Editorial: In a state still reeling from Greitens' chaos, a solid choice for attorney general","Nov 13, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-in-a-state-still-reeling-from-greitens-chaos-a/article_77c9309a-419d-5a01-877a-1db8bae72ffb.html,"Gov. Mike Parson is making sound choices in the job he inherited after former Gov. Eric Greitens’ scandal-plagued administration ended June 1. Parson’s appointment Tuesday of state Treasurer Eric Schmitt, a fellow Republican, to be Missouri’s new attorney general offers hope that the state’s top lawyer will be someone actually dedicated to the job.Soon-to-be-former Attorney General Josh Hawley was never quite there, having turned his focus to this year’s U.S. Senate campaign soon after his 2016 election. Hawley’s Nov. 6 defeat of Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., means he will head for Washington in January. All indications are that Schmitt is a serious public servant who will treat the attorney general’s office as the vital one it is and not just another rung in a climb up the political ladder.

Parson now will have to fill Schmitt’s treasurer’s seat, which sets up an unusual scenario: Four of Missouri’s six non-federal statewide offices — governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general and treasurer — will be filled by people who weren’t elected to those offices. This disconcerting situation is an ongoing repercussion from Greitens’ brief, disastrous reign.Schmitt didn’t receive the editorial board’s 2016 endorsement for treasurer. We opted for his Democratic opponent, Judy Baker, who we argued had more relevant experience. But we also noted Schmitt’s positive attributes, including his history of bipartisanship as a legislator and his leadership in sponsoring post-Ferguson municipal court reforms. His performance as state treasurer has been a picture of quiet competence.

That should mark a welcome shift at the attorney general’s office, which Hawley politicized to spotlight attention-grabbing and divisive national issues — including dragging Missouri into a multistate lawsuit attempting to kill the Affordable Care Act — while neglecting less flashy but more crucial functions, like going after illegal polluters. An exodus of experienced litigators from the office was widely blamed on low morale under Hawley, whose ideological fervor and ambitions for higher office were quickly obvious.Parson’s choice of Schmitt is the kind of level-headed decision-making Missouri is learning to expect from the new governor, who has proven to be his chaotic predecessor’s opposite in just about every way. Parson earlier appointed state Senate Majority Leader Mike Kehoe to succeed him as lieutenant governor, another solid choice. It’s safe to assume Parson’s eventual decision on the new state treasurer will be a responsible one.Still, it’s a disturbing statement about what one unfit officeholder like Greitens can do to a state’s leadership landscape that, months later, we’re looking at having most statewide offices held by people the voters didn’t put there. Missouri voters’ choices in the 2016 election serve as a reminder of how important it is to prioritize substance over style and dedicated public servants over ladder-climbers."
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Editorial: Parson, new majority leader signal meeting of the minds on priorities","Nov 12, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-parson-new-majority-leader-signal-meeting-of-the-minds/article_fdd33684-845f-58cb-bb35-03eadd9292a9.html,"Gov. Mike Parson has a new apparent ally in his effort to get lawmakers in Jefferson City focused on his administration’s top priorities. State Sen. Dave Schatz, R-Sullivan, is the incoming Senate president pro tem after being elected majority leader last week. Schatz immediately made clear that he shares Parson’s goals of enhancing bipartisan cooperation while focusing on “workforce development, infrastructure investment.”Missouri is at one of those rare crossroads where both parties can find significant grounds for agreement. Democrats should have few arguments against efforts to boost urban employment and fix the state’s decaying roads and bridges. This is Missouri’s turnaround moment after the chaos and division fomented by Eric Greitens, the disgraced former Republican governor who seemed to make it his mission to thwart political moderation and bipartisan cooperation.Enough already. Parson and Schatz appear to be making healthy and concerted efforts to reduce partisan tension and restore a businesslike atmosphere in Jefferson City. “We hope to have great working relationships with both sides of the aisle,” Schatz said last week.

Likewise, the Senate minority leader, Gina Walsh of Bellefontaine, noted the close working relationship she had with Parson when he was a state senator. Though “philosophically we’re not often on the same page,” Walsh says, the friendship between the two “is an example of agreeing to disagree and still maintain a relationship to work through the things we can agree on. And I really believe that Missourians want that from their elected officials.”Parson seems to have good intentions and is committed to restoring vitality to Missouri’s most troubled urban areas. He outlined his focus on workforce development and infrastructure during a Sept. 7 meeting with this editorial board. The Democratic mayors of Missouri’s two largest cities — St. Louis and Kansas City — joined him.
Workforce development, he said, means adequately training young workers to meet the skills requirements of area employers, especially those in high-tech fields. Opportunities to put more and more St. Louisans to work in the Cortex innovation district and new National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency western headquarters will be lost if schools and professional training centers aren’t giving them the skills that employers need.
Last week’s defeat of Proposition D, which would have boosted fuel taxes to fund highway and bridge upgrades, makes it even more imperative that the Legislature find ways to fund infrastructure improvements.The upcoming legislative session in January will undoubtedly include some pronounced political differences. Schatz, for example, has made clear he’s no fan of the voter-approved Amendment 1 “Clean Missouri” proposition to reduce lobbyist influence and revise the way legislative districts are drawn.It’s up to him to ensure that such differences prove to be the rare exception to an otherwise cooperative and productive session, now that the Greitens mess is behind us."
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Gas tax defeat means Missouri lawmakers will be seeking money for roads,"Nov 12, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/traffic/along-for-the-ride/gas-tax-defeat-means-missouri-lawmakers-will-be-seeking-money/article_9a9949ab-60ce-5eb0-8f69-4b9d0be368fe.html,"Missouri voters’ rejection of a gasoline tax increase last week leaves state officials scrambling again for a successful route to solving the Missouri Department of Transportation’s chronic money problems.The measure, Proposition D, was defeated by a vote of about 54 percent to 46 percent. The gradual 10-cent-a-gallon hike carried only in St. Louis city, three metro Kansas City counties and four outstate.Rejection by voters in St. Louis, St. Charles, Jefferson and Franklin counties came despite bipartisan support from the top elected leaders in each one.

They joined Republican Gov. Mike Parson, Democratic Mayor Lyda Krewson and a long list of business and labor groups on the campaign.The loss followed the defeat in 2014 of a statewide sales tax hike for transportation also put before voters by the Legislature. More than 59 percent voted against that proposal.“I am sitting here kind of dumbfounded as to what do we do next” to deal with road and bridge funding needs, said state Sen. Dave Schatz, R-Sullivan, a key player in crafting the defeated measure.But Schatz, who will likely take over as Senate president pro tem when the Legislature reconvenes in January, said he and other state leaders intend to make transportation funding a priority next session — seeing it as a key to economic growth.He said he is meeting with Parson, Lt. Gov. Mike Kehoe, the incoming Missouri House leadership and MoDOT officials to try to come up with a proposal to the Legislature to address at least some of the estimated $825 million a year in unfunded road and bridge needs.Kehoe said the same.“I believe most Missourians feel we do have a shortage in funding for the highways,” Kehoe said. “We just haven’t been able to coalesce around the solution.”The two, in separate interviews, said at this point they weren’t pushing any particular ideas.And it’s unclear now if another ballot proposal would emerge or if the Legislature could be asked to simply pass a more limited revenue infusion itself.Under the state’s Hancock Amendment, tax and fee hikes raising revenue below a certain level — about $101 million last year, according to a report from the state auditor’s office — don’t have to go before voters. Schatz said the allowable level is now more in the $80 million range.Some lawmakers interviewed said increasing various license and registration fees might be one possibility to raise some revenue for MoDOT.Another fix conceivably could have the Legislature itself raise the gas tax incrementally (2 cents for one year would raise about $80 million) without putting it before voters.
But many lawmakers probably would be loath to do that so soon after Tuesday’s rejection at the ballot box. ”You have to respect the voters,” said Rep. Jean Evans, R-Manchester, who supported Prop D.Another idea, said Rep. Kevin Corlew, R-Kansas City, might be assigning to road projects some of a big increase in state revenue considered likely to occur following a U.S. Supreme Court ruling last June that widened the reach of state taxes on online purchases.Giving MoDOT a cut from taxes if Missouri legalizes sports betting also could be looked at, another legislator speculated.Corlew, who lost his own re-election bid last week, had chaired a bipartisan transportation task force which held hearings across Missouri last year and studied the funding issue in depth.The panel, which Schatz served as vice chairman, concluded that a gas tax hike was the best idea for the immediate future. That’s in part because it’s a user fee and paid by both Missourians and out-of-staters passing through on state roads.
Schatz said it’s possible that lawmakers might at some point consider a system in which motorists paid a fee based on vehicle miles driven, not on gasoline purchases.The task force report said that would be in response to increased use of electric or hybrid vehicles and could either be in addition or in lieu of a gas tax.Meanwhile, Kehoe and Schatz said they oppose toll roads, an idea that’s been raised on and off for decades — especially for rebuilding and widening Interstate 70 between the outer edges of metro St. Louis and the Kansas City area.Kehoe said 60 percent of the state’s population lives within 30 miles north or south of I-70 and “before you get to the letter L in toll, they start freaking out.” Moreover, the Legislature last year went on record against the idea.Sen. Bill Eigel, R-Weldon Spring, who opposed Prop D, said a majority of voters simply didn’t believe raising taxes was needed to address MoDOT’s funding issues.The convoluted wording of the proposition, which didn’t refer to legislators’ plans to channel most of the added money to MoDOT, could have been a factor as well.Eigel suggested that the Legislature consider shifting to roads some other existing state revenue, arguing that this is “a prioritization problem” and not “a money problem.”He also said the Legislature should discuss “what is the right size and scope” of the state road system. That was an apparent reference to proposals to shift some smaller lettered state roads to county responsibility.But Corlew said that wouldn’t save much. Under a state ban on unfunded mandates, he noted, the state would have to send counties money to cover their extra road costs. He added that counties would lose “economies of scale” achieved when MoDOT maintains those roads statewide."
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"BenFred: Compared to other markets, St. Louis should look even better to MLS","Nov 10, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/sports/columns/ben-frederickson/benfred-compared-to-other-markets-st-louis-should-look-even/article_e21dcb40-161c-5e70-8723-4567042be13e.html,"The home website of Major League Soccer featured a banner Friday across the top of the page that displayed the crests of the league’s 23 active teams.To the right of the elaborate designs rested three empty crests marked only by the city abbreviations for the league’s teams-to-be.An updated look around the field of play makes it easier to imagine “STL” appearing there in the near future.

League expansion, like soccer itself, is not solely dependent on your team’s plan of attack.The strength, skill and organization of your opponents matter.If the team you are facing stumbles, you gain ground.That seems to apply here.Friday made it one month since the MLS4TheLou group announced its plan to secure an expansion team. This renewed effort, backed predominantly by private funding from the Taylor family, should be appealing to the league and the city. Gone is the out-of-town ownership element and the request for $60 million from the public. In its place is increased private funding, a sensible request for a tax on concessions and other sales within the stadium, and an ask for an assist from the state in developing a piece of blighted land already deemed desirable by MLS.Since that encouraging announcement, wheels have turned quietly.The new ownership group has adopted a low-key public approach after its initial splash, but that’s not a bad thing. Those who have heard briefings by ownership group member Jim Kavanaugh have described his outlook as intensely optimistic regarding his discussions with city, state and MLS leaders. Kavanaugh shared during a recent podcast appearance with broadcaster Dan McLaughlin his hopes of checking significant boxes within the next 90 days. Asked for specifics Friday, a representative for the ownership group said more information could be available as early as next week.That 90-day timeline would be an impressive goal, considering the Board of Aldermen has not approved a financial package, and the requested tax credits have not been approved by the state. But again, optimism remains high at this point. If city leaders who donned scarves at the news conference are as eager behind closed doors as they were in front of cameras, there should be no hurdle that can’t be cleared. Gov. Mike Parson has been interested and helpful, a direct contrast from his predecessor, who was pulled down by scandal after undermining the previous attempt to secure a team.Vibes remain upbeat.Even more so if you consider the competition.
In last month’s announcement about the future of the Columbus Crew, MLS said it would solve consternation about the Crew’s potential relocation by a) welcoming in new owners who planned to keep the team in its current location and b) assisting departing Crew owner Anthony Precourt in establishing a team in Austin, Texas. What does that mean for St. Louis? Well, if the league’s previously announced plan is followed, the math would suggest MLS would have just one vacant spot to fill before reaching its goal of 28 teams by 2022.The count: 23 existing teams, plus the announced additions of Miami, Nashville and Cincinnati. And then the plans for Austin.That leaves one big TBD with more than a handful of cities in the mix. Sounds competitive. But let’s look closely.San Diego voters just sided with a college football stadium proposal for land the San Diego ownership group hoped to claim. This was after the ownership group there referred to the vote as a referendum on the hopes of landing a team.Sacramento remains without an ownership group with deep enough pockets to impress the league. Columbus staying put would spoil hopes of the Crew relocating to California.
Detroit’s plan for modifying Ford Field as a soccer venue instead of building a soccer-specific stadium has been publicly rebuked by MLS Commissioner Don Garber.Charlotte and Raleigh heard Garber say in September that he does not envision any more southeastern clubs joining the league soon.Phoenix is fascinating. The city’s United Soccer League club is strong. Billionaire Chinese investor Alex Zheng seems determined. But all the money in the world won’t change the fact that MLS would have to compete with the NFL, MLB, NHL and NBA in that market. That’s a tough act to follow.The MLS did not respond when asked Friday for an expansion update.“The timeline for announcing the next MLS expansion teams has not been set,” read an MLS statement provided to the San Diego Union-Tribune this week. “Markets and potential ownership groups remain active.”When it comes to expansion, the league is smart to keep the ball in the air.St. Louis is a prime example of how a seemingly down-and-out city can recover in time to strike.Wait too long, though, and an opponent might do the same.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Republicans pick next leader of Missouri Senate,"Nov 8, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/republicans-pick-next-leader-of-missouri-senate/article_a8f887b6-c258-55e4-869c-23da750bb7f8.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • The senator who championed Tuesday’s failed effort to raise Missouri’s gasoline tax is poised become the top-ranking officer in the state Senate in January.Sen. Dave Schatz, R-Sullivan, emerged Thursday as the Republican choice to replace Senate President Pro Tem Ron Richard, R-Joplin, who is term limited.Schatz, 54, a businessman, will be formally named to the post in January when the new Legislature is sworn in.

Schatz was first elected to the House in 2010. He moved to the Senate in 2014 and was re-elected in Tuesday’s balloting with 64 percent of the vote over Democrat John Kiehne.During the spring legislative session, Schatz sponsored the legislation that put the gasoline tax increase on the ballot. The proposal, which failed, would have phased in a 10-cent increase in the state’s 17-cent per gallon fuel tax to help finance road construction and bridge improvements.As the leader of the Senate, Schatz said he hopes to work with Gov. Mike Parson on his agenda of workforce development and infrastructure improvement.The failure of the gas tax, he said, presents a problem for the latter.“We’re going to have to address that,” Schatz said.He also said he anticipates no significant changes in the procedures used in the Senate, which encourage debate and negotiation.
“We want to make sure we maintain the traditions of the Senate,” Schatz said. “We hope to have great working relationships with both sides of the aisle.”Others vying for the top post included Republican Sens. Bob Onder of Lake Saint Louis, Ed Emery of Lamar and Mike Cunningham of Rogersville.Schatz said it took three ballots to pick a winner.
After Tuesday’s election, the partisan makeup of the Senate and the House remained unchanged, with Republicans holding a 24-10 advantage in the Senate and a 116-47 majority in the House.Sen. Caleb Rowden, R-Columbia, was named to the No. 2 post in the Senate. Rowden, who is in his first term as senator after serving in the House, will take over as Senate majority floor leader replacing Mike Kehoe, who left to become lieutenant governor. Kehoe also was term-limited.Republicans in the House earlier nominated their leadership team, which includes Speaker Elijah Haahr of Springfield and Majority Floor Leader Rob Vescovo of Arnold.Rep. John Wiemann of O’Fallon succeeds Haahr in the position of House speaker pro tem.Wiemann, an insurance broker, is in his third term in the House.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"The gas tax won't go up, so what happens to roads and bridges?","Nov 7, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/online/the-gas-tax-won-t-go-up-so-what-happens/article_8fda4ad9-c5b1-5234-9ab3-38ad29e3e0e8.html,"A vehicle follows a detour for a closed road near the state Capitol in Jefferson City, Missouri, on Friday, Nov. 2, 2018. AP photo. 


David A. Lieb


The short answer? Triage.State officials had called the gas tax that Missouri voters rejected Tuesday a first step toward meeting more than $800 million a year in road and bridge needs. The measure would have raised the current state tax (17 cents a gallon) by 2.5 cents each year until it hit 27 cents in 2022. 

It would have assigned an estimated $123 million a year, when fully in effect, directly to cities and counties for local road and bridge improvements and $288 million to the Missouri Highway Patrol.
That's a significant amount of money transportation officials will just have do without, MoDOT Director Patrick McKenna said Tuesday night.
So now, it means ""setting priorities among the many equally important transportation projects will be a tough job with limited resources,"" he said.Infrastructure remains a top priority for Gov. Mike Parson's administration. Parson had traveled throughout the state to campaign for Proposition D.A spokesperson for the governor could not immediately be reached about Parson's next steps for road and bridge improvement."
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,The Hawley win could have domino effect on Missouri Republicans,"Nov 6, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/the-hawley-win-could-have-domino-effect-on-missouri-republicans/article_8fc2883c-e4b8-554a-a2ef-29b370d5f0e6.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • For the second time in his short tenure as Missouri’s chief executive, Gov. Mike Parson may be appointing someone to a statewide office .If Missouri voters elect Republican Josh Hawley to the U.S. Senate on Tuesday, Parson will be charged with filling the vacant attorney general post, just as he filled the lieutenant governor’s seat after he took over as governor on June 1.On Monday, however, Parson and other top GOP officials were staying tight-lipped on any deliberations they might be having over picking someone to serve out the remaining two years of Hawley’s term if he beats Democratic U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill.

“The governor is very much focused on ensuring Josh Hawley is successful in the election Tuesday,” Parson spokesman Steele Shippy said.Parson was on the campaign trail with Hawley and other top Republicans Monday urging voters to back the 38-year-old candidate in a tight race that could determine which party controls the U.S. Senate.Aides said no decision has been made about the appointment process and there is no short list of potential replacements.To qualify as the state’s chief legal officer, the attorney general must be a citizen of the United States, a resident of Missouri for one year and be licensed to practice law.Earlier speculation had former Missouri House Speaker Todd Richardson, an attorney from Poplar Bluff, as a possible pick, but Parson last month appointed Richardson to a $225,000-per-year job overseeing the state’s Medicaid program.Republican Treasurer Eric Schmitt, a former state senator from Glendale who is in his first term in statewide office, has been active on the campaign trail for Hawley, speaking last week at Hawley events in Chesterfield and La Plata.He also endorsed a ballot initiative last week to raise the state’s 17-cent per gallon gas tax by 10 cents, which has been championed by Parson as a way to rebuild the state’s roads and bridges.But Schmitt said Monday he said he’s not lobbying for the appointment.“I’m focused on getting Josh elected,” Schmitt told the Post-Dispatch.Republican Lt. Gov. Mike Kehoe, who was appointed by Parson to take over his old job, said he’s unaware of any front-runners for the attorney general post.
“I haven’t been involved in any behind-the-scenes conversations. I don’t think the governor would think that’s appropriate anyway,” Kehoe said.Republican Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft, also an attorney, said he doesn’t plan to discuss the opening with Parson.“That’s up to the governor. I’m not going to tell the governor what to do,” Ashcroft said.
Another name in the mix is St. Louis attorney William Corrigan Jr., who ran as a Republican for St. Louis county executive in 2010. Corrigan, who works at the Armstrong Teasdale law firm, was among those vying to become U.S. attorney in Missouri’s eastern district last year.Attorney Bev Randles, who was beaten by Parson in the 2016 Republican primary election for lieutenant governor, also could be considered. A Sikeston native, Randles now practices law in Kansas City. Randles served on the board of the Missouri Club for Growth, a political action committee funded largely by retired St. Louis financier Rex Sinquefield.A potential internal selection could happen with Darrell Moore, a former Greene County prosecutor who is serving as Hawley’s $130,000-per-year deputy attorney general.If either Schmitt or Ashcroft were chosen, that would open up another statewide office for Parson to fill, potentially leaving four of the five statewide offices filled by someone who was not elected to that particular post during the 2016 election.Parson, for example, was elected as lieutenant governor, but took over when former Gov. Eric Greitens resigned amid scandal.He appointed Kehoe as his successor on June 18.Editor's note: This article was published in print on Nov. 6.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Hawley knocks off McCaskill in bid for Missouri's U.S. Senate seat,"Nov 6, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/national/govt-and-politics/hawley-knocks-off-mccaskill-in-bid-for-missouri-s-u/article_0d324e56-f0a6-54c7-84f7-aff7f37ef1ea.html,"Updated at 11 p.m.JEFFERSON CITY • Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley is headed to the U.S. Senate after handily beating Democratic U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill on Tuesday.In a race that saw massive amounts of outside spending, Hawley was poised to win by a 55-42 margin buoyed largely by strong support in rural areas of the state.

He spoke to a crowd gathered in Springfield moments after McCaskill conceded.""Tonight the people of Missouri have said we're up to the challenge,"" Hawley said.. ""Tonight the people of Missouri have said we're ready to answer the call at this hour. Tonight the people of Missouri have said we believe in America, we believe that our best days are ahead, we believe in our future and we are ready to fight for it.""McCaskill, speaking to supporters in St. Louis, said there were some positive moments to the evening, including Democrats taking control of the U.S. House.""Obviously we fell short and that's disappointing,"" said McCaskill, who will leave after two terms in the Senate.

    var pymParent1000 = new pym.Parent('map-us-senator', '//graphics.stltoday.com/apps/elections/livemaps/missouri.html?race=missouri-us-senate', {});
McCaskill decried the nastiness of the campaign, but said she's been blessed to have worked in an interesting job seeking to help people.""I want to save my biggest thanks for the people of Missouri,"" McCaskill said. ""This state drives me crazy but I love every corner of it.""Hawley, 38, tied himself closely to President Donald Trump, who won the state by 19 point in 2016. Trump contacted Hawley to congratulate him as the votes were being counted.Republican Sen. Roy Blunt lauded Trump’s campaigning on Hawley’s behalf.“No president in the history of the country has made this kind of effort for a ticket he is not on,” Blunt said.While he noted the loss of the House of Representatives, Blunt said the pickup of several Senate seats was significant because an individual senator’s leverage over legislation goes down.“You can do a whole lot more with 53 Republican or 54 Republican senators than you can with 51,” Blunt said.EARLIERUpdated at 10:25 p.m.Jefferson City • Although votes were still being counted in Democratic strongholds, the chairman of the Missouri Republican Party believes Attorney General Josh Hawley has won one of the most pivotal Senate races in the nation.In a statement, Missouri GOP chief Todd Graves said Hawley's vote totals are a carry over from 2016, when voters gave President Donald Trump a resounding 19 point victory.""Tonight, we kept the winning streak going with Josh Hawley's incredible defeat of Claire McCaskill,"" Graves said.""Months of hard work, knocking on doors, and tireless efforts to get out the vote across the state contributed to this win. I couldn't be prouder of the hundreds of volunteers and staff that sacrificed their time and resources to make this happen, and I'm honored to call Josh Hawley our next Senator from the great state of Missouri,"" Graves added.With more than half of the precincts reporting, Hawley held a 59 percent to 37 percent lead over the two term senator.Hawley tied himself closely to Trump during the high profile campaign that saw more than $76 million in outside spending, much of that from leaders in the Senate on both sides of the aisle.In Springfield, at Hawley's election night party, former Lieutenant Gov. Peter Kinder told the crowd that with Kansas City in and most of St. Louis County in “we don’t think Claire McCaskill can climb the wall that outstate Missouri is delivering.” “You and I both know this should have happened six years ago,” Kinder said.Moments later he came back out to tell the crowd Fox News had called the race for Hawley. The room erupted.Updated at 10:10 p.m.JEFFERSON CITY • Attorney General Josh Hawley continued to hang on to a sizable lead in his bid to oust Democratic U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill Tuesday.Although Missouri's reliably Democratic urban areas were still not fully counted, attendees at McCaskill's election night watch party were showing concern as the results rolled in.As of 10 p.m., Hawley was up by a 60-37 margin.“I’m trying to stay as optimistic as I can,” said Laura Rossmann, of St. Louis County, who watched the results with her hand covering her face at the McCaskill party’sA groan went through the crowd when it was projected that Democrats would not be able to take control of the Senate.St. Louis Mayor Lyda Krewson stopped by the McCaskill party about 9:30 p.m. to show support for McCaskill.“All we can do is wait now,” Krewson said. “And hope that the senator will get another six years to represent Missouri.”In Springfield, where a crowd had gathered for Hawley, top state officials stopped by in support of their GOP candidate, who was the recipient of multiple visits by President Donald Trump over the course of the campaign.Gov. Mike Parson revved up the crowd around 10 p.m., telling them Hawley would truly represent them and support “Christian” and “moral” values in the Senate.EARLIERUpdated at 9:25 p.m.JEFFERSON CITY • Republican Attorney General Josh Hawley was making a strong showing in rural Missouri Tuesday as vote totals in one of the most closely watched U.S. Senate races continued to trickle in.According to early returns reported by CNN, Hawley was up by 60 percent to 36 percent over Democratic incumbent U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill.The vote tallies looked to mirror the 2016 election, in which President Donald Trump beat Democrat Hillary Clinton by 19 points. Rural areas were strongly red. Vote totals in Missouri's urban areas were not complete.Trump's presence in the race drove big turnout numbers in some precincts, where long lines meant the polls stayed open well after their 7 p.m. scheduled close.In St. Louis, Stephen Webber, chair of the Missouri Democratic Party, took the stage at the McCaskill watch party at about 9 p.m. to say election officials expected the last vote to be cast around 9:30 p.m.“It’s shaping up to be a typical Missouri election night,” Webber said, adding it would be a long night but they are hoping for good news for McCaskill.Kevin McGilly attended the McCaskill watch party after a week of knocking on 432 doors as a volunteer for the campaign. McGilly traveled from Washington D.C. to volunteer because he said he’s long respected McCaskill and thought it was one of the most important races in the country.“Whatever ways this goes Claire is a survivor,” McGilly said.In Springfield, where Hawley was holding his watch party, Frank Gillham of Springfield talked enthusiastically about Trump.
“Half of my Teamster buddies supported Trump,” he said. “They still do.”Hawley is more of an unknown for Gillham. But he took a similar leap of faith with Trump and “has never seen the country turn around this quick.”“You just have to trust he’ll do the right thing,” Gillham said of Hawley.Missouri Treasurer Eric Schmidt addressed the Springfield crowd shortly after 9 p.m., and said models based on rural vote tallies made Hawley’s camp “cautiously optimistic” about the night’s outcome.EARLIERUpdated at 8:45 p.m.JEFFERSON CITY • With an estimated 16 percent of the vote counted, Republican Attorney General Josh Hawley is leading Democrat Claire McCaskill in her bid for a third term in the U.S. Senate, according to one report.With Missouri Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft holding off on releasing vote counts until all polls are closed, CNN is reporting that Hawley is up by a 58-38 margin.The vote totals show Hawley running strong in rural areas of the state that helped propel President Donald Trump to a 19-point victory in 2016.Meanwhile, the New York Times reports McCaskill with a lead of about 5 percentage points. The Times relied on different county election data than did CNN.The Missouri Secretary of State's Office is keeping the official tallies secret until all voters are able to cast ballots. ""We are estimating the final vote cast will be after 9:30 p.m.,"" the office tweeted at 8:51 p.m. Among the places voters were waiting more than an hour after polls closed: Washington University in St. Louis.Hawley ran much of his campaign on a promise to support the president, while McCaskill argued that she will support Trump initiatives when they make sense for Missourians.Springfield resident Jeremy Boyts, selling ""Make America Great Again"" hats outside of Hawley’s election night party in Springfield, was confident the night would end well for Republicans. He sees how many people come to rallies for Trump and other candidates when he sets up his merchandise stand.“There is no blue wave. It’s a fallacy,” he said. “The amount of people I see who take off work on a Tuesday to go support Trump or Josh amazes me.”EARLIER
Updated at 7:50 p.m.JEFFERSON CITY • The first unofficial returns in the pivotal race for U.S. Senate in Missouri have been reported, with incumbent Democrat Claire McCaskill leading by a slight margin over Republican challenger Josh Hawley.The 51 percent to 46.5 percent count comes primarily out of Jackson County in the Kansas City region, an area where McCaskill is expected to fare better than her GOP counterpart.The tally represents just 10,755 votes out of an expected turnout of more than 2 million voters.In Springfield, where Hawley is holding his election night party, Will Shafer, sporting a Make America Great Again hat, cast his first vote this year.  The 18-year-old who worked on the presidential campaigns of both Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and later President Donald Trump, wasn’t ready to write off McCaskill.“In the past, I felt super-confident... I don’t today,” he said. “Claire, I have to give her credit, she did a good job of making herself look moderate.”His “jam-packed” polling place in Lampe, near Branson, made him feel better.“It made me more confident voting this morning,” he said.McCaskill supporters also were nervous as they began to gather in a ballroom of the Marriott St. Louis Grand hotel in downtown St. Louis after the polls closed.“I couldn’t sleep last night because I was so anxious, I don’t know if I can take another gut-punch like the 2016 election,” said McCaskill supporter Anne Schrupp, 30, a nurse from St. Louis, as she watched the results start to trickle in. “Trump was a wake up call for me.”EARLIERJEFFERSON CITY • With control of the U.S. Senate on the line, Democratic U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill and Republican state Attorney General Josh Hawley closed out their often ferocious campaigns Tuesday hoping they’ve convinced their supporters to get to the polls.Fueled by over $76 million in outside spending, the marquee race in Missouri has been in a virtual tie for months, according to polls.McCaskill, who is running for a third term in a state where President Donald Trump won by 19 points in 2016, has focused on health care and Hawley’s attempt to get rid of Obamacare as she’s traversed the state in what will likely be her last election.

	var pymParent1 = new pym.Parent('chart-us-senator', '//graphics.stltoday.com/apps/elections/missouri/1.html', {});
McCaskill, 65, has described herself as a moderate who also supports increased border security. She ran an ad in the closing week of the race trying to distance herself from what she called “crazy Democrats.”Hawley, 38, who is serving his first term as the state’s chief legal officer, has sought to cast McCaskill as out of touch with a state that has turned red in recent elections.He has made McCaskill’s votes against the confirmation of Supreme Court Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh a key component of his campaign, arguing that she won’t support Trump on major issues.Before making final campaign stops, Hawley voted in Columbia while McCaskill voted in Kirkwood.Those votes followed a day-long barnstorming tour by Hawley and top Missouri Republicans on Monday culminating in a rally with Trump in Cape Girardeau.McCaskill appeared in Columbia Monday with veterans, saying she had worked to improve veterans' livelihoods since taking office in 2007.Hawley is in Springfield awaiting vote tallies, while McCaskill will be in St. Louis Tuesday night.Jacob  Barker contributed to this story from Springfield.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Voters say yes to 'Clean Missouri' ethics overhaul, $12 an hour minimum wage by 2023","Nov 6, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/voters-say-yes-to-clean-missouri-ethics-overhaul-an-hour/article_c3a88bf4-9037-54fa-b462-51a1092ac968.html,"Updated 12:00 a.m. With almost all votes counted, Missouri appears to have overwhelmingly approved a plan to gradually raise the state's current $7.85 minimum wage.Proposition B will bump the minimum rate to $8.60 an hour starting Jan. 1, and increase it every year by 85 cents until reaching $12 in 2023.

	var pymParent11 = new pym.Parent('chart-missouri-proposition-b', '//graphics.stltoday.com/apps/elections/missouri/11.html', {});


With 95 percent of precincts reporting, the proposition won 62 percent of the vote. St. Louis attempted to raise its own minimum wage in 2015, but the ordinance was challenged in court. When it finally became law, the victory was short-lived as the Missouri Legislature passed an override. In the months that followed, proponents turned to a ballot initiative to hike the wage statewide. 

	var pymParent7 = new pym.Parent('chart-missouri-constitutional-amendment-1', '//graphics.stltoday.com/apps/elections/missouri/7.html', {});
Also appearing to win big as the final results trickled in is Amendment 1, better known as ""Clean Missouri."" The proposal includes a ban on most lobbyist gifts to lawmakers, a reduction of campaign contribution limits and would extend the application of open records laws to state lawmakers.Its most controversial provision would change Missouri’s system for drawing state legislative districts with a model designed to have the number of seats won by each party more closely reflect its statewide vote.Still, the measure won approval from more than 60 percent of voters, according to unofficial results from the Missouri Secretary of State's office. Updated 11:35 p.m. The Associated Press has called victories for both Missouri Auditor Nicole Galloway and Amendment 2, one of three medical marijuana ballot initiatives. The measure, backed by New Approach Missouri, asked voters for approval to impose a 4 percent tax on retail marijuana sales, which would go toward veterans’ health care. The state estimates the proposal would generate $18 million in fees and sales tax each year.

	var pymParent1002 = new pym.Parent('chart-marijuana-issues', '//graphics.stltoday.com/apps/elections/missouri/marijuana-issues.html', {});
As of 11:30 p.m., Galloway led her Republican challenger, Saundra McDowell, by five points: 50 percent, to 45 percent for McDowell. 

	var pymParent6 = new pym.Parent('chart-missouri-state-auditor', '//graphics.stltoday.com/apps/elections/missouri/6.html', {});
Amendment 2 won more than 65 percent of the vote. Two other medical marijuana initiatives on the ballot Tuesday lost by wide margins. Missourians also defeated Proposition D, a measure to raise the gas tax for infrastructure improvements. The measure's backers conceded, but said ""seeking new funding for Missouri’s proven critical infrastructure needs was still the right thing to do.""Updated 11:15 p.m. Missouri Auditor Nicole Galloway has now taken a razor-thin lead in her race to remain Missouri's top fiscal watchdog. With 87 percent of precincts reporting, Galloway has 48 percent of the vote to 47 percent for Saundra McDowell, her Republican opponent. McDowell has led by a fairly large margin for most of the night, but the Associated Press has now called the race for Galloway. Updated 11 p.m. Republican Ann Wagner has won re-election to the U.S. House, defeating Democrat Cort VanOstran in Missouri's 2nd congressional district.

	var pymParent3 = new pym.Parent('chart-us-representative-district-2', '//graphics.stltoday.com/apps/elections/missouri/3.html', {});
Final numbers are not in, but VanOstran has conceded. As of 11 p.m., Wagner held a four point lead. Updated 10:50 p.m. Missouri Auditor Nicole Galloway has tightened Republican Saundra McDowell's lead, but with 66 percent of precincts reporting, she's still behind. McDowell has 49 percent of the vote so far, to Galloway's 45 percent.  Updated 10:45 p.m. With roughly half of all precincts reporting, incumbent U.S. Rep. Ann Wagner holds a five point lead over her Democratic opponent in the 2nd District, with 52 percent of the votes to Cort VanOstran's 47 percent. Updated 10:20 p.m. Three of the most-watched proposals on the Missouri ballot Tuesday took an early lead and appear to be cruising to victory. With half of the state's precincts reporting, Amendment 1, the ""Clean Missouri"" ethics overhaul, won nearly 60 percent of the vote, according to unofficial results from the Missouri Secretary of State's office. One of three medical marijuana initiatives won big on Tuesday night. Amendment 2 is headed for passage with 61 percent of voters approving it so far. The other two medical marijuana proposals are losing by wide margins. It's also unlikely Missouri will see a hike in its gas tax, with a measure pushed to fix up the state's roads and bridges losing big, 44 percent to 56 percent. It appears Missouri's minimum wage will increase statewide, with Proposition B holding a 16 point lead. That proposal will gradually raise the wage to $12 an hour by 2023. Amendment 4, which would change prerequisites for bingo volunteers, holds a very narrow lead, 51 to 49 percent. Updated 10:00 p.m. U.S. Rep. Ann Wagner now holds a three point lead over Democratic challenger Cort VanOstran. Amendment 1, the ""Clean Missouri"" measure, has won 59 percent of the vote with more than 40 percent of precincts reporting. Proposition B to raise the minimum wage and Amendment 2 for medical marijuana hold similarly large leads. The other two marijuana proposals are losing handily, as is a measure to raise Missouri's gas tax. Updated 9:45 p.m. With roughly 30 percent of precincts reporting, several of Missouri's high profile ballot initiatives have established early leads. The “Clean Missouri” initiative, an overhaul of state ethics laws, has won approval of 57 percent of voters, to 43 percent, according to unofficial results from the Missouri Secretary of State's office. Proposition B to raise Missouri’s minimum wage has sizable early lead, with 55 percent in favor.One of three medical marijuana initiatives is winning big so far, with nearly 60 percent in favor. The other two measures, Proposition C and Amendment 3, are trailing, with only 39 percent and 30 percent, respectively.A plan to increase the state's gasoline tax for road work and the Missouri Highway Patrol was losing in early returns Tuesday night. With nearly a third of the vote counted statewide, the measure - Proposition D - was losing by a 57 percent to 43 percent.Missouri State Auditor Nicole Galloway is trailing Republican challenger Saundra McDowell by about nine points, with about 34 percent of precincts reporting.The race between Republican U.S. Rep. Ann Wagner and Democrat Cort VanOstran is neck-and-neck so far, with VanOstran winning 50 percent of the vote to Wagner’s 48.5 percent, with about 8 percent of precincts reporting.
Updated 9:10 p.m.: Missouri Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft's office was delaying posting any statewide vote tabulations Tuesday night until people in long lines at polling places in St. Louis County and Jackson County in the Kansas City area had finished voting.Maura Browning, a spokeswoman for Ashcroft, said the office was holding off posting any partial results so as not to influence people still waiting in line to vote. State law allows people in line at the official 7 p.m. closing time to vote.
Latest update: We are estimating the final vote cast will be after 9:30 p.m. Please be patient. Every vote matters. #MOvotes #moleg #MOSen— Missouri SOS Office (@MissouriSOS) November 7, 2018

Ashcroft's office tweeted that shortly after that officials estimated the final vote in Missouri would be cast after 9:30 p.m. ""Please be patient. Every vote matters,"" the tweet read. Eric Fey, Democratic director of elections for St. Louis County, said about 200 people were still waiting in line at 7 p.m. at the polling place at the Washington University Field House that serves voters who live on campus. He said it was expected that all waiting there would have voted by about 8:30 p.m. He said polling places at the Maplewood and Black Jack city halls and Pattonville Heights Middle School had smaller lines at 7 p.m.ST. LOUIS • For many, the wait to cast a ballot on Tuesday was a long one. But the polls have now closed and Missouri voters will soon know the fate of several high profile ballot issues, their new state auditor and the results of a nationally watched suburban St. Louis congressional race. This story will be updated as results come in. • Results for all area elections• Results for Missouri elections• Results for St. Louis County elections• Results for St. Louis City elections• Results for St. Charles County elections• Results for Jefferson County elections
U.S. Representative, 2nd District

	var pymParent3 = new pym.Parent('chart-us-representative-district-2', '//graphics.stltoday.com/apps/elections/missouri/3.html', {});
A Missouri congressional district that’s long been solidly Republican has nonetheless drawn national attention heading into this Tuesday’s election, as political newcomer Cort VanOstran will attempt to unseat incumbent U.S. Rep. Ann Wagner in her bid for a fourth term.It'll be an uphill battle for the Democrat, as Wagner has a deep political resume and has raised significantly more money. But the race is one of several that have been largely viewed as a referendum on President Donald Trump, who won the district in 2016 by a wide margin.  Missouri State Auditor

	var pymParent6 = new pym.Parent('chart-missouri-state-auditor', '//graphics.stltoday.com/apps/elections/missouri/6.html', {});
Missouri State Auditor Nicole Galloway, the lone Democrat in Missouri holding statewide office, will attempt to ward off a challenge from Republican Saundra McDowell, attorney who formerly worked for the Missouri Secretary of State’s office.Missouri Constitutional Amendment 1

	var pymParent7 = new pym.Parent('chart-missouri-constitutional-amendment-1', '//graphics.stltoday.com/apps/elections/missouri/7.html', {});
Better known as ""Clean Missouri,"" voters will decide on a potential overhaul of state ethics rules on Tuesday. It includes a ban on most lobbyist gifts to lawmakers, a reduction of campaign contribution limits and would extend the application of open records laws to state lawmakers. Its most controversial provision would change Missouri’s system for drawing state legislative districts with a model designed to have the number of seats won by each party more closely reflect its statewide vote.Missouri Constitutional Amendment 4

	var pymParent10 = new pym.Parent('chart-missouri-constitutional-amendment-4', '//graphics.stltoday.com/apps/elections/missouri/10.html', {});
This measure would amend the Missouri Constitution to change the restriction on the experience required for workers to run bingo games.Missouri Proposition B

	var pymParent11 = new pym.Parent('chart-missouri-proposition-b', '//graphics.stltoday.com/apps/elections/missouri/11.html', {});
The state initiative known as Proposition B would gradually raise Missouri’s minimum wage to $12 an hour. It's $7.85 an hour now. That change wouldn't happen overnight if it wins approval on Tuesday: Proposition B would bump the minimum rate to $8.60 an hour starting Jan. 1, and increase it every year by 85 cents until reaching $12 in 2023.Missouri Proposition D

	var pymParent13 = new pym.Parent('chart-missouri-proposition-d', '//graphics.stltoday.com/apps/elections/missouri/13.html', {});
State transportation officials and other supporters – including Missouri Gov. Mike Parson – say Proposition D is an essential first step toward meeting $825 million a year in unmet state road and bridge needs.Under the proposition, put on the ballot by the Legislature, the current 17-cents-a-gallon state tax would increase 2.5 cents each year starting next July until it hits 27 cents in mid-2022.Medical marijuana initiatives

	var pymParent1002 = new pym.Parent('chart-marijuana-issues', '//graphics.stltoday.com/apps/elections/missouri/marijuana-issues.html', {});
Voters weighed in on three medical marijuana ballot initiatives on Tuesday. Missouri would be the 31st state to legalize marijuana for medicinal use if any of the three pass.Amendment 2 from New Approach Missouri asks voters for approval to impose a 4 percent tax on retail marijuana sales, which would go toward veterans’ health care. The state estimates the proposal would generate $18 million in fees and sales tax each year.Amendment 3, funded by Springfield physician Ben Bradshaw, would impose a 15 percent tax on medical pot sales to finance a state institute to conduct research on cancer and other diseases.Proposition C, sponsored by Missourians for Patient Care, would change state statutes to make marijuana legal for medical use and impose a 2 percent retail tax on medical marijuana, channeling revenue to early childhood education, veterans care, public safety and drug treatment.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Vote yes on Missouri’s Proposition D for safety and savings,"Nov 2, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/columnists/vote-yes-on-missouri-s-proposition-d-for-safety-and/article_a1f887d7-04ec-5fb2-8fc6-16bb87f711c5.html,"Missouri’s population and economy are growing, which is great news for the strength and vitality of the state, but it also means our highways and residents are feeling the pressure — literally. Since 1996, drivers have been paying 17 cents per gallon in fuel tax to maintain Missouri’s roads and bridges. Meanwhile, the cost of construction materials, just like bread and milk, have tripled. Due to these rising inflation and construction costs, this 17-cent fuel tax that we have had for over 20 years now equates to seven cents in purchasing power.Residents are feeling the heat as they spend an average of $604 annually in vehicle repairs due to poorly maintained roadways, compared with $533 per driver nationwide. This money could instead be going toward our roads and bridges to make them safer and stronger. Our state’s highways need new investment in infrastructure because of new innovations in safety design of highways. In April, the American Society of Civil Engineers Missouri Sections (Kansas City and St. Louis Sections) released the 2018 Report Card for Missouri’s Infrastructure. The Report Card assessed infrastructure categories and assigned Missouri with the overall grade of “C-.” The Roads category received a D+, which means they are poor and at risk and the Bridges category received the grade of a C, which means they are mediocre and require attention. Missouri has the 7th largest system of roads and bridges in the country but ranks 49th in funding to maintain these investments, with only Alaska below us.Proposition D is a statutory referendum to fund Missouri state law enforcement and maintenance for highways, bridges, roads, and streets, which will be possible by increasing the motor fuel tax by 2 1/2 cents per gallon annually for four years beginning July 1, 2019. This initiative will cost the average Missourian only $1.28 per month initially and will improve the state’s roads and bridges. These improvements will save time spent in traffic, save money on maintenance costs, and allow $1 billion in federal matching funds for states and bridges. The Missouri State Highway Patrol is currently funded by the fuel tax. Prop D will provide new funding for highway patrol, which will free up current fuel tax revenues to go toward funding for construction and maintenance of roads and bridges. It will also ensure state law enforcement will have the funding needed to effectively protect the public. This initiative is a win-win-win.

While Missouri has made major strides in roadway safety, there is still work to be done. The American Society of Civil Engineers Missouri Sections offered a few solutions in the 2018 Report Card for Missouri’s Infrastructure, which provided steps we can take to work on how to raise Missouri’s infrastructure grades. Solutions including investment and preparing for the future. We argued that a long-term revenue stream for transportation must be identified in order to improve our competitiveness and keep residents safe. The full report card may be found online at infrastructurereportcard.org/Missouri.
As civil engineer experts, we are stewards of public health, safety and welfare as we plan, design, construct and maintain our infrastructure networks, which is why we endorse Prop D.On Tuesday , Missouri voters can have the final say on making roads and streets safer by voting yes on Prop D to ensure safety on roads and money back in the pockets of the driver. Missouri’s transportation infrastructure, with 34,000 miles of road and well over 2,000 bridges is a vital factor in our state’s economic growth. For these reasons, Prop D is a bipartisan effort supported by Gov. Mike Parson, Lt. Gov. Mike Kehoe, St. Louis County Executive Steve Stenger and St. Louis Mayor Lyda Krewson. Other supporters include a statewide coalition that includes business owners, labor, city and county leaders, farmers, law enforcement supporters, and professional associations.
The future of Missouri’s infrastructure investment is up to voters. Mark yes on Proposition D to build a better and safer future for Missouri.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,One of Josh Hawley's first moves as Missouri AG: scrapping his environmental division,"Nov 1, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/one-of-josh-hawley-s-first-moves-as-missouri-ag/article_b135dc8e-6889-5b5d-8abc-ba0e9e917509.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • When Attorney General Josh Hawley took office in January 2017, he eliminated his agency’s agriculture and environment division.For years, the state described the division in its “Blue Book” as one that “aggressively protects Missouri’s natural resources and agricultural productivity.” Some of the office’s best lawyers were assigned to the division, which handled some of the state’s most complex cases, ranging from Missouri River water rights to dealing with pollution left behind after generations of lead mining.Hawley, a Republican who won election as attorney general after 25 years of Democratic administrations, startled at least some state lawyers when he cut the division.

“I was surprised that that was one of his first administrative moves in the office,” said Joseph Bindbeutel, who was the consumer protection division’s chief counsel before Hawley took office. “I think it sent a really chilling message to staff — that that was no longer what he considered to be an important part of the mission.”“I don’t think environmental problems have gone away,” added Bindbeutel, who resigned on Hawley’s inauguration day.“That was a big red flag to me,” one attorney who still works in the office, and who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation, said of the division’s elimination. After Hawley’s inauguration, “poof, it was gone.”When asked about his office’s reorganization, and the environmental team’s dissolution, Hawley, now running for U.S. Senate, spoke only in general about the reorganization.“We pursued a fairly significant reorganization of the office,” Hawley told the Post-Dispatch. “We consolidated the many different divisions in the office, which had sort of proliferated — you know, they gathered over the years — add a division, add a division, add a division.”Mary Compton, Hawley’s office spokeswoman, said in a statement: “The Office carefully reviews all referrals and enforces Missouri’s environmental laws.”ReorganizationOut of nine divisions that existed under Democrat Chris Koster, Hawley’s predecessor, Hawley dissolved only the environmental division. He downgraded the remaining eight divisions into sections and placed the various sections under two general divisions: civil and criminal.














        
            How Josh Hawley shook up the Missouri attorney general's office — and what happened next

Critics say Hawley's administration bled staffers and dedicated limited resources to firing salvos toward the federal government. Hawley said a reorganization was long overdue.




Scott Pruitt, a Republican who became attorney general in Oklahoma in 2011, also dissolved his environmental unit upon taking office, according to E&E News, which covers energy and environmental issues. Like Hawley, Pruitt also formed a Federalism Unit that was dedicated to challenging federal laws and regulations.Pruitt later served as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency under President Donald Trump. Critics say Pruitt worked to dismantle the agency from the inside.• Hawley vs. McCaskill: Coverage of the 2018 Senate raceFormer Attorney General Jay Nixon, a Democrat who later became governor, formed the environmental division in 1993. In so doing, he elevated environmental issues to the highest organizational status within the office.“I think clean air and clean water and a good environment to work in — hunt, fish, live, breathe — are important,” Nixon said in explaining the move.




















        
            Nixon Tire Fire

Attorney General Jay Nixon speaks at a blazing tire dump about the importance of a state account that funds environmental cleanup efforts. The…




Having a division focused on environmental and agricultural issues “allowed folks to get expertise, not only in a certain area concerning air and water and permits and whatnot,” Nixon said, “but equally importantly, to make sure that when the state was needing something that it was done in a strong and consistent way.”When Hawley dissolved the division, he split its duties between the office’s government affairs and litigation sections.
The Post-Dispatch and The New York Times have reported that the litigation section of the attorney general’s office has been plagued by departures since 2017. Michael Quinlan, who worked in the office for less than a year, left weeks after a female employee complained that Quinlan had lectured her about her sex life, the Times reported.














        
            Josh Hawley has announced multiple lawsuits and investigations. What has he accomplished?

While his adversaries portray him as someone more interested in headlines than actual results, Hawley lists a number of actions in the two years he's been in office.




When asked about the environmental team’s dissolution, Quinlan said in an interview: “It’s emphatically not the case that environmental matters were given less attention or handled any less vigorously.”EnforcementEven after Hawley’s changes, the attorney general’s office remained in charge of handling environmental cases.The Missouri Department of Natural Resources, which also came under Republican leadership in 2017, said the attorney general’s office was handling about 180 of its cases; many of them take years to resolve.
Compton said the DNR made 58 enforcement referrals in 2015 and 48 enforcement referrals in 2016.She said DNR had made 36 enforcement referrals to the office since January 2017. The attorney general’s office has “taken action” on 25 of those referrals and is preparing actions on the remaining 11, Compton said.“The Attorney General’s Office does not have original jurisdiction over most environmental matters and relies on client agencies to refer matters for enforcement,” she said in a statement.Past staffers said that while the office generally does wait for referrals before taking action, the attorney general can push for referrals behind closed doors; or, the office can take action unilaterally on environmental matters.Bill Bryan, who served in Nixon’s environmental division before working for his gubernatorial administration, said the attorney general’s office could act independently of regulators to enforce environmental laws.“It is always an answer to say that ‘Nobody’s asked me to do that,’ but that doesn’t mean it’s the right thing to do,” Bryan said. “There are mechanisms for the attorney general to be an advocate for the people and protect the environment when they think it’s necessary.”When asked for highlights of Hawley’s environmental record, Compton pointed to a settlement with the owners of the Bridgeton Landfill; a letter Hawley wrote to Illinois regulators in opposition to proposed levee rules; continued legal action against a North Dakota/Missouri River water project; finalizing a trust connected to a settlement with Volkswagen over its emissions; and ensuring St. Joseph-based HPI Products continued to clean up hazardous waste.The Post-Dispatch reported in October that under then-Gov. Eric Greitens and current Gov. Mike Parson, both Republicans, the DNR has emphasized compliance checks over enforcement measures.For example, the number of “notices of violation” peaked at 4,266 in 2014 before trending downward. Last year, there were 2,360 notices of violation; through Sept. 26 this year, that figure stood at 1,283.

While critics worry that the state is going soft on polluters, the DNR contends that its role is to partner with industry to ensure compliance.In a Senate debate this month, Hawley acknowledged that humans cause climate change and then segued into a defense of cutting government regulations.“We should look at science and see what the outcomes can be,” Hawley said. But, he said, “I am very concerned about environmental regulations coming from the EPA and elsewhere that choke off family farms, that choke off small businesses.”

Galloway entered the final stage of the race before the election next Tuesday with $546,000 on hand.Republican Saundra McDowell, who broke through a four-way GOP primary in August, again posted anemic fundraising figures. She raised $41,000 in October and spent $43,000, ending the period with $24,000 on hand.

Besides fundraising problems, McDowell's campaign has been dogged by scrutiny surrounding her family's finances — and whether she is even eligible to be on the ballot given her apparently brief time in Missouri.All three medical marijuana campaigns showed a pulse heading into the final week.That said, the only donations Missourians for Patient Care — a shadowy group backing Proposition C — recorded in October were two in-kind donations totaling $93,000.Missourians for Patient Care again declined to disclose its donors, even though the Missouri Ethics Commission has criticized the concept. The committee faces an ethics complaint alleging it is intentionally concealing donors in violation of the law.The only way the proposed statutory change will go into effect is if it passes and two other proposed constitutional amendments fail.New Approach Missouri, backing Amendment 2, received almost $192,000 in October and spent $132,259. The committee had $99,341 on hand going into the final week of the campaign.Find The Cures, which is backing Amendment 3, reported raising $344,000, $309,000 of that coming in the form of loans from Springfield physician and trial lawyer Dr. Brad Bradshaw.The campaign reported spending almost $300,000 during the reporting period, and had $89,000 on hand.Raise Up Missouri, which is backing Proposition B, an effort to raise the state's minimum wage to $12 per hour by 2023, spent an eye-popping $4 million in October, raised an additional $811,000, and entered the final stage of the campaign with nearly $600,000 on hand.
The Sixteen Thirty Fund, a liberal ""dark money"" group, donated $4.7 million of the roughly $6.6 million Raise Up Missouri has raised for its campaign.SaferMO, which is backing a gradual 10-cent increase to the state's fuel tax, Proposition D, raised almost $2.5 million in October and spent almost $888,000 during the reporting period. Construction groups and local governments appear to be heavily invested in the effort.Gov. Mike Parson and Lt. Gov. Mike Kehoe, both Republicans, are also backing the ballot initiative.Clean Missouri, which is sponsoring a suite of ethics changes contained in Amendment 1, spent $2.2 million and raised $1.1 million, leaving $341,000 on hand before election day.
Missourians First, leading the anti-Amendment 1 campaign, raised $201,500 in October. St. Louis financier Rex Sinquefield donated $200,000 of that.Missourians First had $144,000 going into election day after spending $57,000.The Democrats' Missouri House Victory Committee raised almost $136,000 in October and spent $220,000. The committee ended the fundraising period  with $113,000 on hand.According to the report, the Democratic committee was working to influence 18 races though direct financial assistance, indicating the party believes its best shots are in select metropolitan districts across the state.2018 Missouri House races
The party infused cash directly into St. Louis County's 70th, 94th, 95th, 96th 99th and 100th districts. It is also playing in St. Charles County's 65th District and Jefferson County's 97th and 113th districts.The committee also aided three Columbia-area campaigns, one Springfield campaign, and five western Missouri districts, including the St. Joseph-based 10th, and the Kansas City-area 14th, 30th, 31st and 35th districts.Of the 18 in the report, the 10th and 97th districts are the only districts that Democrats currently control.

Under the proposition, put on the ballot by the Legislature, the current 17-cents-a-gallon state tax would increase 2.5 cents each year starting next July until it hits 27 cents in mid-2022.That, MoDOT says, would restore the tax’s purchasing power it had when it was last increased back in 1996. Now the tax, the 49th lowest among the 50 states, has the buying power of only 7 cents.

“The gas tax does not grow with the general growth of the economy the way income or sales tax does,” McKenna said.The keep-up-with-inflation message has been a centerpiece of some TV ads for Safermo.com, the gas tax campaign committee which has raised more than $4.3 million.Much of that has come from companies and unions that stand to benefit if road and bridge work increases.Leading the way have been the Laborers Union’s Eastern Missouri District Council based in Bridgeton, which has kicked in $1 million, and the Heavy Constructors Association of Greater Kansas City, which has contributed $650,000.No organized opposition effort has emerged. But some state lawmakers who opposed the plan in the Legislature complain that the ballot wording and the proposition are misleading.The measure assigns a projected $123 million a year from the tax hike when fully implemented directly to cities and counties for local road and bridge improvements and $288 million to the Missouri Highway Patrol.However, there is no mention of more gas tax money for MoDOT in the ballot listing or the proposition.But supporters say assigning all of the state share of the tax hike to the patrol would allow the Legislature to then redirect from the patrol to MoDOT a like amount in projected revenue from the current gas tax proceeds.How much more money, if any, the patrol would receive than it would otherwise get from revenue from the existing gas tax rate is hard to project, campaign officials say.That’s because the Legislature has been steadily increasing the patrol’s percentage share in recent years and could be expected to do so anyway even if Proposition D fails, campaign supporters say.But the proposition would stabilize the patrol’s future funding, they say.The critics say the ballot listing as passed by the Legislature overstates the benefit to the patrol because of polling showing strong public support for law enforcement.“I voted against it (in the House) because it’s an intentional shell game,” said Rep. Kurt Bahr, R-O’Fallon. He also says he doesn’t like tax increases in general.He added, however, that he doesn’t doubt that MoDOT would in the end get much of the extra revenue that campaign supporters say it would.Sen. Dave Schatz, R-Sullivan, who helped craft the language, acknowledged that supporters made sure the patrol is in the ballot listing because of polling results and proven voter support for raising taxes for police.But he said the wording is fair. He said also that legislators were limited by a law restricting the length of the ballot listing.
He noted that they also needed to include references to an unrelated bill that the gas tax measure was tacked onto in the final day of the legislative session.That bill — which is now also part of Proposition D — would exempt from state taxes prizes and medals won in the Olympics and similar events.While the Legislature would have the final say each year on the exact amounts from the gas tax going to MoDOT and the patrol, Schatz pointed out that the state Constitution doesn’t allow the state’s share of the gas tax to be used for any other purpose.Proposition D also includes a provision authorizing the Legislature to set up a fund in future years for major road projects aimed at alleviating truck traffic bottlenecks. But the measure doesn’t assign any money or revenue source for that.Unlike in some past tax hike campaigns to aid MoDOT, an itemized highway project list to be funded hasn’t been released.Instead, MoDOT officials have been holding public meetings with local officials around the state to get input on what types of improvements they want the most.“It’s very important that regional planning commissions and transportation advisory committees have the opportunity to weigh in on this,” McKenna said.Schatz added that not issuing an itemized list avoids any internal fighting among advocates for their favored priorities.
However, McKenna and others have pointed out some big-ticket items already in MoDOT’s plans likely would be accelerated if voters approve the tax hike.In the St. Louis area, for example, reconstruction of a big stretch of Interstate 270 in north St. Louis County and reconfiguration of overpasses, ramps and access roads, has been cited.With existing revenue, MoDOT has been able to commit over the next four years only $250 million of the estimated $700 million cost.McKenna said advancing the 270 project “is critical to the economic vitality of the region” and the entire state, partly because of its integral part of freight trucking operations. Doing the work in one unified project is the best way to accomplish that, he said.“We are hundreds of millions of dollars away from that reality right now,” he said.In addition to steering $288 million in new state money to MoDOT, supporters say the gas tax increase would potentially qualify the state to receive hundreds of millions more a year in federal aid should Congress expand its highway programs.The pro-gas tax effort has gotten campaign help from a bipartisan list of elected officials.That includes Republicans such as Gov. Mike Parson and Lt. Gov. Mike Kehoe and leading Democrats such as St. Louis County Executive Steve Stenger and St. Louis Mayor Lyda Krewson. The top elected officials in St. Charles, Jefferson and Franklin counties, all Republicans, also are on board.The campaign estimates that local governments in the St. Louis area would get an estimated $34 million more a year in gas tax money when the increase is fully implemented. St. Louis County and its municipalities get the biggest cut, about $16 million.Supporters have taken pains to call the gas tax plan a user fee, since individuals and companies using roads and bridges are the ones that would pay the tax hike.That removed a key argument made in 2014 by opponents of the proposed sales tax for roads that year — that it would have shifted the burden for highways from the trucking industry and others that use it to the general public.In addition to gas and diesel, this year’s proposition also would increase the tax on some other motor fuels such as compressed natural gas beginning in 2025.Moreover, the measure requires state agencies by 2023 to come up with a way to tax electric-powered vehicles “at substantially the equivalent rate” and to implement it by 2026. That provision also applies to alternative fuels.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,5-year-old on quest to meet Missouri's mayors hits jackpot at Municipal League meeting,"Oct 26, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/year-old-on-quest-to-meet-missouri-s-mayors-hits/article_f19b500a-96c3-5fa5-abc2-fa86d5d18347.html,"Five-year-old Taylor Duncan's goal this year has been to have ice cream with as many Missouri mayors as she can. On Thursday night at the Municipal League of Metro St. Louis meeting in Florissant, she boosted her tally wholesale.Taylor, who has also shared a frozen treat with Gov. Mike Parson in her half-year campaign, added 22 St. Louis County mayors, who partook in ice cream as part of their attendance. She toured the room, asking brief questions of each, and posed for a group picture.Before Thursday, Taylor had met with 118 mayors this year. Now she has a running total of 140, plus one governor.

""This will run through the end of the year,"" said her mother, Therese Duncan, who home schools Taylor. ""That's mostly because my husband is military.""He has been stationed at Fort Leonard Wood, about 10 miles from the family's home in Waynesville.The Duncan family has set up a gofundme account to help cover the gas for their trips around the state to continue Taylor's quest.In addition to eating ice cream on Thursday, league members approved by resolution their annual priority list, urging Missouri lawmakers to:
• Restore the right of municipal courts to impose penalties on those who fail to appear in court.
• Enforce the collection of internet sales tax, as allowed by a U.S. Supreme Court ruling.• Have a local expenditure database, provided that it applies to all governments and not just municipalities.• Work to establish a high-speed internet overlay district as has been done with local participation in the Columbia and Kansas City areas.• Create a statewide prescription drug-monitoring program.• Oppose statewide votes on strictly local issues.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Can anyone beat Steve Stenger for St. Louis County executive?,"Oct 25, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/can-anyone-beat-steve-stenger-for-st-louis-county-executive/article_2d3fe1f7-a5dd-597f-b740-5cc0b0f81c75.html,"ST. LOUIS COUNTY • Political ads for pivotal races in Missouri and Illinois are crowding St. Louis airwaves, but one important contest has been uncommonly quiet: the race for St. Louis County executive.Many pundits believed the county executive race was decided in August; that the winner of the Democratic primary would cruise to victory in the general election.Incumbent Steve Stenger seems to believe it, barely campaigning after his razor-thin victory over deep-pocketed challenger Mark Mantovani in a bruising primary marked by negative campaigning and big spending on both sides.

Stenger spent just $33,000 in September, or less than 1 percent of the $4 million he raised overall during his campaign. He did not buy radio or TV time. He still has $679,000 on hand.He’s on a different financial plane than his three challengers. Republican Paul Berry III, a bail bondsman who has hosted a political TV show, had spent $12,600 on the entire election and had less than $1,000 at the end of September. He received a $30,000 contribution Oct. 19, campaign finance records show. Libertarian Nick Kasoff, an IT consultant and rental property owner in Ferguson, has raised less than $500. Andrew Ostrowski, from the Constitution Party, did not submit campaign finance reports to the Missouri Ethics Commission.Stenger declined to meet with Post-Dispatch journalists to discuss the November election. A campaign official noted that Stenger had already sat for a lengthy interview before the primary and saw no benefit to doing it again.Is Stenger safe?Veteran political watchers say Stenger seems likely to be re-elected.Any Republican candidate for a St. Louis County race in a general election could expect about a third of voters to select a straight GOP ticket, said E. Terrence Jones, a professor emeritus in the political science department at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, a veteran politics watcher.To have a chance, Berry would have to add significantly to that base and hope the independent candidates divert voters from Stenger.Although the county leans strongly Democratic, the GOP has shown it can compete. Stenger beat Rick Stream for county executive in 2014 by less than a point, with neither candidate capturing a majority. Stream did not concede the race until after Christmas. But Stream was an experienced politician with wide support in his party. He raked in $173,000 in donations in September 2014, riding a red wave.Berry has no such party support, no such wave, Jones said. The Republican Central Committee of St. Louis County endorsed Berry but gave him just $2,000.“You’ve got to be able to go out and raise your own money in this county,” said the former chairman, Bruce Buwalda.Republican leaders said they were happy with Berry’s effort, particularly in placing yard signs across north St. Louis County, said Rene Artman, the county’s GOP chairwoman. “He is working, working, working, working, working,” she said. “You see Paul Berry signs everywhere. You don’t see Stenger signs.”Berry lacks influential backers among area elected officials. No members of the County Council have endorsed a candidate, despite their abysmal relationship with Stenger. Berry emphasized that he has appeared at events with officials including Missouri Gov. Mike Parson and U.S. Rep. Ann Wagner but had not sought their endorsements because they would not help him in north St. Louis County.At least one high-profile Republican, state Rep. Shamed Dogan, R-Ballwin, endorsed Kasoff. So has a prominent Democrat, state Sen. Maria Chappelle-Nadal, D-University City.“Berry’s party has abandoned him,” Jones said. “The odds of pulling this off are in the one-in-50 range.”UMSL political science professor Dave Robertson said Stenger appeared to have several advantages. A generic Democrat in an average countywide race could expect a six- to eight-point advantage. And Kasoff and Ostrowski lean conservative, meaning they may be more likely to siphon votes away from Berry than from Stenger.
Primary returns put a spotlight on Stenger’s relatively strong position in the general election, Jones noted. Stenger trounced Mantovani, a wealthy businessman, in the working-class areas of north and south St. Louis County, while Mantovani fared well among college-educated progressives and wealthy voters across the central corridor.Berry, who did not graduate from college and has struck a populist tone in the style of President Donald Trump, is not likely to fare well in areas that went for Mantovani, Robertson said. People in the central corridor are “a group that by and large is predisposed to vote Democratic, and is going to be largely for Claire McCaskill in the U.S. Senate race,” he said. “They might express dissatisfaction with Stenger by not voting for anyone for county executive, but I doubt if they will vote for a Republican candidate.”Chasing StengerStenger has pointed to many successes: a diverse cabinet, a prescription drug monitoring program, the county’s AAA bond rating.Still, all three challengers say they believe Stenger can be beaten. Voters may be weary of his long-running political war with both Democrats and Republicans on the County Council. And he has been dogged by disclosures in the Post-Dispatch that contributors to his campaign enjoy favorable treatment from county government.Ostrowski, 56, of Maryland Heights, said he thought Mantovani would have won the Democratic primary if Stenger had not called him out for having supported Gov. Eric Greitens.
The three candidates chasing Stenger can make it close because voters are looking for alternatives, he said. Politics isn’t about wooing voters, he said, “it’s about getting them to vote against the other guy.”Ostrowski, who owns a cleaning services franchise, wants to institute a sales tax to set up an investment fund that would ultimately eliminate property taxes in St. Louis County. He also wants to build high-speed trains along all area interstates.Berry, 40, the only African-American in the race, believes he will get votes from Democrats who don’t like Stenger, particularly black voters in north St. Louis County. He has published a series of videos attacking Stenger with unsubstantiated allegations of corruption and dishonorable acts. Challenged by journalists to back up his claims, Berry cited unnamed political insiders.Berry borrows heavily from Trump’s political style. His Facebook posts blast news organizations, including the Post-Dispatch, as “fake news.” He refers to his opponents by sarcastic nicknames. He calls his platform “St. Louis County First.” Among the highlights:He would work to oppose a merger of St. Louis and St. Louis County. He says the city is “hurting from failed government policies.”He would require all security on Metro to be handled by St. Louis County police, and not by Metro’s own armed security force.He would abate the first $50,000 of property taxes for any resident who is at least 70 and who has paid county property taxes for 40 years.He would try to ensure that county residents who work in the city would not have to pay the city’s 1 percent wage tax.












Political Fix





        
            Paul Berry has had financial issues





Kasoff, 52, described himself as a “social justice libertarian.” Among his aims is to help homeless people by developing a village of tiny houses on county-owned land near the St. Charles Rock Road MetroLink station. He said he could improve lives “at a very low cost with minimal government involvement. And that’s what it means to me to be a libertarian.”Kasoff said he wanted to ensure that every county employee was helping improve quality of life. “It doesn’t mean we’re going to fire people, but it may mean that people’s jobs change,” he said. He said the county was doing a “lousy job” on some things, including maintaining county roads and unincorporated neighborhoods.Berry and Kasoff have jousted online, with Kasoff, a landlord, calling attention to Berry’s history of being evicted from apartments several times for not paying rent.But they have both blamed Stenger for the cloud hanging over county government, and think they can do better bridging the gap.“It’s shameful that we have a county council and county executive that are so at odds that they’re suing each other,” Kasoff said. “About half of the Democrats didn’t support Mr. Stenger (in the primary). I know the people who didn’t support Mr. Stenger. It isn’t that Mr. Stenger was their second choice. It’s that they by no means wanted Mr. Stenger to be re-elected as county executive.”

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"After Greitens' school board meddling, search for new commissioner narrowed to four","Oct 23, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/after-greitens-school-board-meddling-search-for-new-commissioner-narrowed/article_bb655bf4-4c22-564d-aea5-9f3331e0ab60.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Missouri school officials are set to launch interviews with four finalists seeking to be the state’s next education commissioner.In a meeting Tuesday, state Board of Education President Charlie Shields said the month-long application period drew five resumes and seven nominations before it closed last Friday.The board met behind closed doors Monday to review the 12 potential commissioners, winnowing them to four with an eye on conducting final interviews by Nov. 19.

“I think we’re excited about the opportunities that are before us. We intend to move forward with all due speed,” Shields told members gathered for a regular meeting of the board at the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education headquarters.The current salary for the post is $191,544, and candidates must have a doctorate to be considered.The board hopes the new commissioner can start in January.
Roger Dorson, interim commissioner, has led the department since December, when the board fired former Education Commissioner Margie Vandeven.The board became powerless in January when the Senate refused confirm former Gov. Eric Greitens' nominees to the panel. A search for Vandeven's replacement then ended because the panel could not form a quorum.
Greitens' replacement, Gov. Mike Parson, has re-stocked the board, allowing members to launch the search process again.Shields has praised Dorson for his leadership and said the board could opt to remove the ""interim"" tag from Dorson's title by the end of any selection process.On Tuesday, Shields did not announce the names of the four finalists. Among possible contenders is Rockwood School District Superintendent Eric Knost, who announced earlier this month he will retire after 31 years in public education at the end of this school year.During the scuttled search process in January, 10 people applied to replace Vandeven.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Parson taps speaker of Missouri House to run Medicaid program,"Oct 22, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/parson-taps-speaker-of-missouri-house-to-run-medicaid-program/article_959530f5-ae6a-5474-bfd1-fc21b385497d.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Missouri Gov. Mike Parson has chosen the outgoing speaker of the Missouri House to run one of the biggest programs in state government.Rep. Todd Richardson, 41, a Republican from Poplar Bluff, was named director of the state’s Medicaid operation Monday, marking the first time in nearly two years that the program has had a permanent director.Richardson, an attorney, replaces Joe Parks, who served as the director of the program, known formally as MO HealthNet, from 2013 to 2016.

Richardson’s salary will be $225,000, up from the $210,000 Parks was earning when he left. As speaker, Richardson was paid $38,400 per year.Parson and Department of Social Services Director Steve Corsi defended the high salary, which is more than the governor and other agency heads earn.“This is a $10 billion department in this state. It’s huge,” Corsi said.“This isn’t an easy role, and it comes with many challenges,” Parson said.MO HealthNet provides health insurance services to nearly 1 million residents at a total cost of nearly $10 billion, making up about one-third of the state budget.The federal government pays for a significant portion of the program, which provides prescription drugs, nursing home services and managed care to low-income seniors, children and disabled Missourians.Richardson, a member of the House since 2010, was elevated to the speaker’s post in 2015, following the forced resignation of John Diehl after Diehl had an inappropriate relationship with a college-age intern. Richardson is term-limited.Corsi acknowledged that the previous two permanent directors of MO HealthNet were physicians, but said Parson had taken a “bold step” by choosing Richardson.
As director of MO HealthNet, Richardson will oversee one of the fastest growing programs in state government.In the state’s most recent budget, lawmakers approved an additional $700 million of spending, primarily to fund higher-than-expected health care costs.Total Medicaid spending in Missouri grew by 6.2 percent last year, with managed care premiums and mental health services driving most of the increase.
During his last session as speaker, which ended in May, the GOP-controlled House expanded MO HealthNet benefits for pregnant women to provide substance abuse treatment for up to year after giving birth.But the Republican-controlled Legislature has repeatedly rejected requests to expand Medicaid eligibility to more recipients as part of the Affordable Care Act. Missouri is among 14 states that haven’t done that, which has limited the state’s ability to provide coverage to low-income adults without children.That has created a coverage gap among the working poor, who earn too much to qualify for Medicaid coverage but too little to afford subsidized coverage under Obamacare.It also has hurt rural hospitals that take care of a large number of uninsured patients.Although the federal government would pick up a majority of the funding for the expansion, state lawmakers have declined, citing concern about long-term funding.Richardson and Parson signaled the GOP position on expansion is unlikely to change.“My focus is not going to be on expanding Medicaid eligibility,” Richardson said.Richardson was already set to be replaced as speaker in January by Rep. Elijah Haahr, R-Springfield.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri's state vet saddles up; Parson administration sniffing around for new animal czar,"Oct 22, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-s-state-vet-saddles-up-parson-administration-sniffing-around/article_d1620ef7-0c8e-5124-b413-92441916a6e7.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Linda Hickam is resigning her post as state veterinarian, a Missouri Department of Agriculture spokeswoman told the Post-Dispatch on Monday.Hickam, who oversees the state's animal welfare laws and health programs, submitted her resignation last week. It is effective Oct. 31, said Sami Jo Freeman, spokeswoman for the department. Hickam held the post since September 2011.""We accepted her resignation,"" Freeman said. Freeman said she wasn't aware of any ""force out"" by department leaders. ""We know that she was was a great state vet and did many things for the department of ag.""

Hickam said in a statement the agency ""has accepted by resignation, effective Wednesday, Oct. 31, to enable me to pursue other career opportunities that will contribute back to Missouri agriculture.""She said the animal health team made ""great strides"" in improving the state's ""animal health laboratory equipment, testing capabilities and ability to respond quickly during a disease incident. We have also worked hard to implement animal health and care programs in a way that improves and protects the health and well-being of Missouri’s livestock.""She added a new program ""will enable producers to market meat and poultry interstate from State Inspected Plants.
""The future of Missouri agriculture is bright, especially with a Governor and Director of Agriculture who are both farmers themselves,"" Hickam said. ""I wish the team at the Department of Agriculture well in all of their future endeavors.""Hickam, a Columbia, Mo., native and graduate of the University of Missouri College of Veterinary Medicine, joined the department in 2007.
In 2011, Missouri lawmakers approved the Canine Cruelty Prevention Act, which Hickam helped enforce. The law increased standards for kennel owners and led to many breeders leaving the business.The Post-Dispatch reported in August that the Department of Agriculture had dramatically reduced referrals of bad breeders to the attorney general's office in recent years. The attorney general's office has since sued one kennel owner in Phelps County; the agriculture department referred a second breeder, in Douglas County, to the attorney general's office in September.Dr. Taylor Woods, who preceded Hickam, will take over on an interim basis, Freeman said, ""to just kind of provide a steady hand"" while the department, under Gov. Mike Parson's administration, searches for a new state vet.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Josh Hawley has announced multiple lawsuits and investigations. What has he accomplished?,"Oct 22, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/josh-hawley-has-announced-multiple-lawsuits-and-investigations-what-has/article_d29d1f4f-7116-561b-bf6d-38036bfe62a5.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Gov. Eric Greitens stormed into power the same day Attorney General Josh Hawley took his seat in a suite of offices across from the Capitol. A year passed before Greitens’ administration began to collapse. Greitens made few friends in the capital city. In April, he took aim at Hawley.Hawley had said at a news conference that Greitens likely committed felony computer tampering before taking office. Greitens fired back with a statement saying that Hawley was “better at press conferences than the law.” A little more than a month later, Greitens resigned, retreating to his Warren County lake house.The episode was striking — two young, conservative outsiders trading barbs.

But Greitens is not the only person to question Hawley’s motivations and effectiveness.Adversaries portray Hawley, 38, as a young man in a hurry — someone more interested in headlines than results.Hawley points to accomplishments that range from helping to orchestrate a sex trafficking sting in Springfield, Mo., to launching an initiative seeking to link service members with pro bono legal help.Now that Hawley is running for U.S. Senate against Democrat Claire McCaskill, his two years as attorney general — the only public office he’s ever held — provide the only work sample voters have to judge his effectiveness as an elected leader.AccomplishmentsWhen he took office in early 2017, Hawley oversaw a chaotic office-wide restructuring that was followed by high turnover, the Post-Dispatch reported Sunday.Despite that turnover, Mary Compton, Hawley’s spokeswoman, cited several accomplishments, including: settling a lawsuit with the Bridgeton Landfill that Hawley’s predecessor filed; collecting a record amount of Medicaid fraud restitution; and earning more than 100 convictions at the trial court level.Hawley also settled a decadelong legal battle between blind Missourians and the state over the Blind Pension Fund.After reporting by the Columbia Missourian on the state’s sexual assault kit testing backlog, Hawley launched an audit of the problem. He documented 5,424 untested kits, though many police agencies did not respond to questions. His office also landed a federal grant to help ease the backlog.Hawley said his consumer protection section has obtained $30 million for Missourians; it was not immediately clear how that figure compares to past administrations. He praised his prosecutors for their criminal convictions and successful judgments on appeal.“They often do it at less pay than they could get in the private sector,” Hawley said in an interview. “And they’re doing a good job.”Hawley’s new Federalism Unit took 14 actions to torpedo federal laws and regulations, including the Affordable Care Act, the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau and several environmental protections. Some former employees complain the emphasis diverted attention away from more pressing (and less glamorous) state business.The attorney general has made other moves that garnered both praise and criticism.On Aug. 31, Hawley filed a lawsuit seeking to enjoin Branson Duck Boats and Ripley Entertainment from operating the vehicles in Missouri. In July, 17 people died when a duck boat sank in Table Rock Lake in Branson during a storm.The company owners questioned the accuracy of his allegations and insinuated the lawsuit was filed to burnish Hawley’s credentials.“The Attorney General’s suggestion that BDV and Ripley flouted safety concerns in the name of profits is nothing more than baseless hyperbole, aimed at leveraging and stoking passions in the aftermath of this tragedy in an effort to polish the Attorney General’s prosecutorial credentials,” the companies’ attorneys wrote in court documents.“People will fight me, accuse me of things all the time,” Hawley said. “I would just say to the Branson duck boat folks — Duck Boat Vehicles and Ripley Entertainment — they better check their rhetoric and take responsibility for their actions, because they’ve got a long road ahead of them.“I don’t want them operating duck boats anywhere in Missouri,” he added.Hawley also has announced several investigations during his tenure, including one into possible Catholic clergy sex abuse, two related to tech companies Google and Facebook and another related to pharmaceutical companies under allegations of opioid pill pushing. He also announced an investigation into Equifax after a data breach last year.“I’m most proud of standing up to the big and powerful on behalf of the people of Missouri — no matter what, no matter who,” Hawley said. “We’ve done that, whether it’s big pharma, big tech or organized crime — human traffickers, Medicaid fraudsters.”Hawley sued several pharmaceutical companies last summer. The Google and Facebook investigations are ongoing. His Catholic clergy probe involves potentially hundreds of thousands of documents.Joseph Bindbeutel, who served three of Hawley’s predecessors, said he was struck by how many times Hawley has publicized his probes.
“Those investigations are going to take years to complete,” Bindbeutel said, referring specifically to the tech probes. “When you yell them (investigation announcements) from the mountaintops, it makes one wonder, ‘Is this about yelling from the mountaintops, or is this about doing a straight up, legitimate, thorough investigation of an issue?’”Greitens’ ghostsHawley has not updated the public in months on his investigation into Greitens’ former charity, The Mission Continues, and whether Greitens or others illegally used charity resources for personal or political gain.He was also investigating to see whether Greitens or his staff illegally used taxpayer resources for campaign purposes, but it is unclear where that probe stands.Hawley said at an August press gaggle that the probes were ongoing. He has unsurprisingly avoided mention of Greitens on the campaign trail.“Greitens’ resignation handed Hawley a great gift,” said Terry Smith, political science professor at Columbia College. “I’m sure Claire was really sad when he left office. It was going to be a real albatross.”Meanwhile, two private attorneys have continued to probe the Greitens administration. Elad Gross, a former assistant attorney general under Democrat Chris Koster, sued Greitens’ nonprofit, A New Missouri, in June after the dark money group declined to turn over financial information to Gross.
Gross is sparring with Gov. Mike Parson’s office over a $3,618 bill for documents. He sued Parson’s administration last week. He also mailed Hawley’s office a packet explaining why he thinks Hawley can investigate A New Missouri, but the office still contends it cannot.Mark Pedroli, a St. Louis County attorney, sued the Greitens administration in December over Greitens’ use of the text-message destroying smartphone app Confide, which he says violated state records retention laws.While Pedroli continues to gather evidence that he says shows Greitens and his staff broke the law, Hawley’s office said in March it found no evidence of wrongdoing.In another case, Hawley used the merchandising practices law to sue the St. Louis Housing Authority and McCormack Baron Management, which both manage the Clinton-Peabody Housing Complex south of downtown St. Louis.Hawley alleged in his August lawsuit that the housing authority and McCormack Baron fraudulently marketed complexes as habitable, when, in fact, the units were not. He wants the two entities to return rent payments to tenants.Problems at the complex, built in 1942, became widely known after mice invaded the complex last fall. While mice infested an estimated 165 of 358 units last December, the St. Louis Health Department said in August that an estimated six units showed evidence of mice after an inspection that month.The housing authority and McCormack Baron have called the lawsuit unhelpful. Cheryl Lovell, director of the authority, said her staff has worked “tirelessly” to solve the problems on a shoestring budget. She said Hawley did not meet with the housing authority before filing a lawsuit.The housing authority and McCormack Baron also say that Clinton-Peabody has not been able to access federal funds that would allow for interior renovations.Hawley says the criticisms sound like “excuses.”“We are going to hold them accountable no matter how much they kick and scream and make excuses,” he said. “These are people’s homes were talking about.”To Hawley’s critics, the headline-grabbing announcement was just that: a headline-grabbing announcement. The two sides are not even scheduled to appear in court for an initial review until Nov. 13, after the election.“I think it’s more political than anything,” said Sen. Jamilah Nasheed, D-St. Louis. “He’s trying to keep his name out there.”

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Parson names SLU president Pestello to Bi-State/Metro board,"Oct 18, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/parson-names-slu-president-pestello-to-bi-state-metro-board/article_3b9c5c29-336e-549a-a71f-e7673b309b64.html,"St. Louis University president Fred Pestello was appointed Thursday by Missouri Gov. Mike Parson to the panel that oversees MetroLink and the Metro bus system.Pestello joins the board of the Bi-State Development Agency as the 10-member panel searches for a new president and CEO to succeed John Nations, who has announced his resignation.The appointment of Pestello, who was recommended by St. Louis Mayor Lyda Krewson, along with the June decision to add Washington University official Rose Windmiller, gives Krewson and St. Louis County Executive Steve Stenger two presumed allies on the board as the CEO selection process continues.

Krewson and Stenger, who both had recommended Windmiller, have been pressing for a role in deciding who succeeds Nations.Stenger has clashed publicly over MetroLink security issues and other matters with Nations and former Mayor Vincent C. Schoemehl Jr., who lost his spot on the Bi-State board when Pestello was appointed.A selection committee of the board met Thursday and was scheduled to meet again Friday. Krewson was at the meeting Thursday, her spokesman, Koran Addo, said.In August 2017, Krewson and Stenger announced they wanted to shake up the Bi-State board.They sent panels of nominees to then-Gov. Eric Greitens to replace four Missouri members on the board whose terms had expired and to fill one vacancy.
Greitens did not act on their request before his resignation in June. After Parson, who had been the lieutenant governor, succeeded Greitens, the county executive and mayor urged him to act on the Bi-State appointments.Pestello wasn’t on the list of nominees originally submitted in 2017 by Krewson for Schoemehl’s seat. He later was added to it, replacing Windmiller on a list of Krewson nominees. Windmiller also had been on a Stenger list for the county seat she now fills.
Pestello’s appointment requires Missouri Senate confirmation. But he can start serving now since the Senate won’t be in session again until January. The Senate signed off on Windmiller last month.The Bi-State board is made up of 10 commissioners, five from Missouri and five from Illinois.Two of the Missouri members represent St. Louis, and two represent St. Louis County for five-year terms. The fifth alternates between city and county residents and is named to a three-year term.Commissioners whose terms have expired, such as Schoemehl, are allowed to continue serving until successors are appointed.Schoemehl on Thursday applauded the appointment of Pestello as his replacement. Schoemehl said when he was CEO of the Grand Center arts district before his retirement in 2015, he got to know Pestello well and believes he will do a great job at Bi-State.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Violence down in St. Louis but homicides hold steady. Are tougher penalties for gun crimes the answer?,"Oct 17, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/violence-down-in-st-louis-but-homicides-hold-steady-are/article_53c935eb-5065-5cd8-b242-8ada666e91dd.html,"ST. LOUIS • Violent crime in the city is down 10 percent compared to last year, St. Louis Police Chief John Hayden said Tuesday, but the homicide rate is fairly constant, with 152 homicides in 2018, compared to 158 at the same time last year.At least half are drug-related, Hayden told members of the city’s Board of Aldermen.There was a flicker of hope in September, when the city was down 25 homicides compared to the previous year, but that shifted after six murders were reported during a particularly violent weekend toward the end of that month. Twenty-eight slayings have been reported in St. Louis since Sept. 23, less than a month ago.

Hayden and St. Louis Public Safety Director Jimmie Edwards provided the numbers as they spoke to members of the Board of Aldermen on Tuesday about the police department’s effort to address crime in St. Louis.They also delivered some more positive news: There have been decreases in robberies and aggravated assaults citywide, the officials said, and police have seized 2,085 guns this year.One specific area where officers have seen progress is in “Hayden’s rectangle,” a trapezoidal area named for the police chief, where law enforcement has focused resources due to its high crime rates. It’s bordered by Goodfellow Boulevard to the west, Vandeventer Avenue to the east, Martin Luther King Drive to the south and West Florissant Avenue to the north.In that rectangle, homicides are down from last year by 13, or 19 percent; robberies are down by 38, or 16 percent; and aggravated assaults with weapons are down by 62, or 11 percent; with violent crime overall down 13 percent, Hayden said.“That strategy is continuing to work,” Hayden said.But many challenges remain, official said. The department is still down more than 130 officers. Witnesses to crimes remain reluctant to come forward for fear of retaliation, making it difficult to close cases. And a lack of state laws to deter gun crimes has forced the police to turn to federal courts to indict some suspects.On Tuesday, Edwards made a new pitch: He wants to see the mandatory minimum sentence for armed criminal action raised from its current ceiling of three years to at least 15 years for nonfatal shootings, and 25 years for fatal shootings.Anyone who commits a felony through the “use, assistance or aid of a dangerous instrument or deadly weapon” in Missouri is also guilty of armed criminal action, in addition to the underlying charge. Edwards said amending this state statue provides a new avenue to crack down on gun crimes in Missouri’s urban areas.
“What I want is for the offender, the person with that gun, to think about the consequences,” Edwards said. “People commit crimes based on risk and reward. What I would like to do is put some teeth in our law and to have this law to address risk and consequences. And the consequences must be significant enough that I am somewhat deterred, or will pause and think about my actions.”Some aldermen expressed concern over that proposal: over its potential effectiveness, if it would lead to higher numbers of incarcerated people, or if it would disproportionately target poor, marginalized communities. Edwards argued it would be applied “irrespective of one’s station in life,” and only to those who intended to do harm with a gun.But it’s unclear whether the idea would get traction in the GOP-led Missouri Legislature, which in 2016 passed a measure allowing gun owners to carry weapons without a state-issued permit, to the chagrin of city officials already facing a region awash with firearms.
“With all due respect to our rural legislators, we don’t shoot turkey and deer and duck with AR-15s and AK-47s in the city of St. Louis,” Edwards said.The public safety director said he has already begun discussions with Missouri Gov. Mike Parson and state legislators to begin pursuing the change, and the next step will be to make sure St. Louis and Kansas City present a united front on the matter.St. Louis Mayor Lyda Krewson and Kansas City Mayor Sly James have already met with Parson in recent months to appeal to him for stronger local control on gun policy, arguing that St. Louis and Kansas City should be able to more tightly regulate guns in their respective regions for the sake of public safety.Parson hasn’t taken a firm stance, but he said he’d keep an open mind should a bill be introduced in the Legislature to address it.In the meantime, St. Louis aldermen on Tuesday asked the police department to begin tracking and reporting the numbers of guns stolen from homes and cars throughout the city the same way they track and report other crimes.{p style=”text-align: center;”}• Crime Tracker: St. Louis city{p style=”text-align: center;”}• Map: St. Louis-area homicides in 2018

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,WGU Missouri Added to Eligible Institutions List for Access Missouri Program,"Oct 16, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/pr/business/wgu-missouri-added-to-eligible-institutions-list-for-access-missouri/article_bfd66a58-d18b-11e8-a738-5cb9017bff18.html,"Thanks to bills passed in Missouri’s House and Senate, eligible WGU Missouri students who already enjoy the university’s low-cost tuition are now able to apply for grant money at the state level – making college even more affordable for hundreds statewide. Effective immediately, low-income students attending the online, nonprofit university can apply for funds through Access Missouri, the state’s need-based grant program. WGU Missouri students have always been able to apply for financial aid through the federal student loan program, however, this is the first time students are also eligible to receive funds through Access Missouri since the university was established in 2013 by former Gov. Jay Nixon. The original bills, Senate Bill 682 and House Bill 1267, introduced by Sen. Brian Munzlinger and Rep. Donna Lichtenegger, respectively in 2017, were amended in March 2018 to SB 807, sponsored by Senator Jay Wasson, and SB 603, co-sponsored by Sen. Robert & Rep. Bryan Spencer. The bills were officially signed into law this summer by Gov. Mike Parson, naming WGU Missouri as an approved virtual institution. Previously, students at all brick-and-mortar colleges in Missouri could apply for Access Missouri funds, but there was debate about whether online institutions like WGU Missouri, which has 750 students eligible for the funds this year, fit the criteria.

“We’ve been working with legislators over the past several years to have WGU Missouri added to the list of institutions whose students are eligible to receive funds through the Access Missouri program, and we are thrilled that our low-income students now have a chance to access these much-deserved funds,” said Dr. Angie Besendorfer, Chancellor of WGU Missouri. “WGU Missouri was created to help meet the needs of working adults by providing them with an affordable, flexible, high-quality, higher education option, and the Access Missouri program will help thousands of students around the state to fulfill their educational goals for years to come.”Financial eligibility for Access Missouri is determined by the Missouri Department of Higher Education using a student’s Expected Family Contribution (EFC) as calculated through the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Award amounts for eligible students range from $1,500 to $2,050 each school year, depending on expected family contribution, which must be $12,000 or less to qualify. For a complete list of requirements, visit https://dhe.mo.gov/ppc/grants/accessmo.php.
WGU Missouri offers more than 50 bachelor’s and master’s degree programs in business, information technology, teacher education and health professions, including nursing. Unlike a traditional college program, WGU caters to adults with previous work experience or who are currently working and looking to further their careers through education. WGU Missouri’s competency-based education model allows adult students to take advantage of prior learning and experience to move quickly through material they already know so they can focus on what they still need to learn.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Parson joins St. Louis area leaders in pushing for state gas tax hike,"Oct 16, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/parson-joins-st-louis-area-leaders-in-pushing-for-state/article_6948ca30-50c6-569f-a0d6-a12f3682810a.html,"BERKELEY • Gov. Mike Parson and a bipartisan group of St. Louis area governmental leaders came together Tuesday to push for passage of Proposition D, the proposed state gasoline tax increase on the Nov. 6 ballot.“It’s probably not the most politically popular thing to do,” Parson, a Republican, said of the idea of endorsing a tax hike. “But at some point you have to take a real reality look at where we are in the state of Missouri and how are we going to move forward.”Parson spoke at a news conference at the Renaissance Airport St. Louis Hotel about the measure, which would phase in a 10-cent-a-gallon increase over four years.

The event kicked off a weeklong statewide tour by the governor on the proposed boost in the fuel tax, which funds state and local road and bridge projects and the Missouri Highway Patrol.Also endorsing the measure were St. Louis Mayor Lyda Krewson and St. Louis County Executive Steve Stenger, both Democrats, and the top elected leaders of St. Charles, Jefferson and Franklin counties, all Republicans.Earlier, Parson talked up Prop D before about 300 people at a Missouri Chamber of Commerce and Industry conference, also at the hotel. He pointed out that the current 17-cent gas tax hasn’t been increased since 1996 and now has the buying power of just 7 cents.He said passage is a key to updating the state’s infrastructure. That’s one of his main priorities, along with workforce development — the subject of the chamber conference. At the news conference, Krewson said: “It’s not often that all of us are together on one issue.”Stenger said: “Unless we make long-overdue investments in our roads and bridges,” the county will lose economic development momentum he says it has picked up in recent years.
Among the projects likely to be funded by the state’s share of the extra money, Stenger said, is reconstruction of Interstate 270 and its overpasses. He said that’s the Missouri Department of Transportation’s top priority in St. Louis County.Scott Charton, a spokesman for the Safermo.com committee funding the gas tax campaign, said local governments in the St. Louis region would get about $34 million more a year once the increase is fully phased in.
That includes more than $16 million for the county and its municipalities and $6 million for St. Louis.St. Charles County Executive Steve Ehlmann called the measure “a user fee” because it would hit only those people who use the roads. “If you don’t drive, if you’re not on the highways, you don’t pay,” he said. “The more you drive, the more you pay.”No formal opposition group has emerged to argue against the tax hike, but supporters have raised more than $2.5 million so far for their pro-Prop D campaign.Under the measure, the tax on gas and diesel would go up 2.5 cents each year starting next year, topping out at 27 cents in 2022. The measure also would increase taxes on alternative fuels such as natural gas and propane.Analysts say the tax hike would generate at least $123 million more a year for local road work and at least $288 million more for state road work. The proposition would earmark $288 million to the state patrol, allowing the Legislature to redirect from the patrol a like amount in revenue from the current gas tax.Transportation officials say the added money will help the state begin catching up on $825 million in unfunded road and bridge needs.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"After hospital visit, Missouri governor says his heart is fine","Oct 16, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/after-hospital-visit-missouri-governor-says-his-heart-is-fine/article_4225497e-4c70-5a69-bea3-0d2e0d54468e.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Missouri Gov. Mike Parson went to a hospital in recent weeks after feeling something wrong in his chest.After a series of tests, including an MRI, he was released without being admitted, the 63-year-old Republican told the Post-Dispatch on Tuesday.Parson, who was sworn in as Missouri’s 57th governor on June 1, said the medical episode occurred between one and two months ago while he was in the capital city.

After Parson felt discomfort, a member of his security detail took him to Capitol Regional Medical Center.“I felt a little uneasy one evening,” Parson said, adding that he decided to go to a hospital “just to get it checked out and make sure everything was OK.”“It was 100 percent, so I’m fine,” Parson added.“He just went to the emergency room out of an abundance of caution,” his press office told the newspaper. “He’s been given a clean bill of health.”Parson underwent open heart surgery on Dec. 24, 2016, just weeks before he was set to be sworn in as lieutenant governor alongside former Gov. Eric Greitens. The surgery came after doctors discovered some blockage in arteries around Parson’s heart.Parson was able to attend inauguration ceremonies at the Capitol in early January 2017.
The governor spoke to the newspaper in St. Louis on Tuesday, where he launched a weeklong series of events in support of Proposition D, a question on the Nov. 6 ballot asking if voters want to raise the gasoline tax by 10 cents to pay for road and bridge construction projects.He was interviewed about his health scare after his appearance at a news conference with St. Louis area governmental leaders at the Renaissance St. Louis Airport Hotel.“I think I probably overreacted because of what happened (in 2016),” Parson said.
Parson takes medication for his heart, but doctors have not limited his activities in any way.“He’s been cleared to do whatever he wishes to do,” his press office said.The Missouri Constitution calls for the lieutenant governor to become governor for the remainder of the term if a governor dies, resigns or is convicted or impeached.Parson, a former state lawmaker and sheriff, took over as chief executive after Greitens’ abrupt resignation amid a scandal and possible impeachment.Among Parson’s first actions was naming Republican Mike Kehoe as lieutenant governor.Kehoe, the former Senate majority floor leader, is 56. A north St. Louis native, Kehoe lives in Jefferson City and represented the 6th Senate District for eight years.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Proposition D is essential to maintain safe highways,"Oct 11, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/columnists/proposition-d-is-essential-to-maintain-safe-highways/article_3d039cb7-5808-5118-8cb7-008da7fc5149.html,"The Nov. 6 election is only weeks away. The people of Missouri have a rare opportunity to do something great on that day for our state, our counties and our cities that will benefit not only our generation but that of our grandchildren and their grandchildren.Proposition D will ask voters to raise the per-gallon fuel tax in 2½-cent increments totaling 10 cents over four years. If this ballot issue is passed, then Missouri will almost catch up with the loss in purchasing power that the current 17-cent gas tax had in 1996, which is the last time that tax was adjusted.I was a panel member of the 21st Century Missouri Transportation Task Force, and we heard testimony from stakeholders from every corner of Missouri. The consensus was that the Missouri Department of Transportation has been an outstanding steward of our limited highway resources, and that with more resources MoDOT is definitely positioned to provide Missourians with safe roads, bridges and overpasses to ensure that travel on our roads is safe and comfortable.

Unfortunately Missouri is ranked 47th in highway funding with the seventh-most miles of roads to maintain. One of every 10 bridges and overpasses in Missouri is compromised, and eventually when a bridge and overpass is closed or weight limits are reduced, we are in big trouble.There is a roadblock ahead if Prop D does not pass. Instead of “Caution, construction ahead” signs, we will see “Detour, road closed ahead” signs that will take us miles and hours out of our way and discourage anyone from investing in our community or state.Fortunately, the campaign to pass Proposition D has endorsements from many organizations, from both rural Missouri from farm organizations and urban Missouri from municipalities and industry organizations. Prop D has bipartisan support, led by Gov. Mike Parson and Lt. Gov. Mike Kehoe, and many cities, including Florissant, have passed resolutions in favor of the passage of Prop D.Over the next 10 years, Proposition D funds will mean more than $2 billion in new state funding for roads and bridges. That will pay for about 46,000 miles of highway pavement and fixing or replacing more than 1,700 bridges on the state system. The federal government is matching the funding states put toward building and maintaining roads and bridges. This initiative will allow Missouri to receive more than $1 billion over just four years in federal funding that would otherwise go to other states.
Prop D is needed to continue funding safety improvements, like adding guard rails and repairing the more than 2,000 bridges rated in poor condition or weight restricted that are getting more dangerous for our families, school buses and emergency responders to cross every day. Proposition D will add more than $100 million in funding to state law enforcers, who risk their lives for us every day.
For every $1 spent on highway construction, $4 of economic activity is generated, meaning that Proposition D will result in over $1 billion of new economic activity and will also generate more than 5,000 jobs a year. That means more money for our schools and better-paying jobs, all while improving our roads.Missouri is in an enviable geographical location in the heart of our nation’s breadbasket, at the confluence of two mighty rivers and at the very center of the continental United States. But we must be able to compete with surrounding states with highways that encourage investment and travel. A safe and efficient highway infrastructure is vital to take advantage of our tremendous potential for economic growth and the jobs that will come with it.The revenue generated from Proposition D will be regularly audited and constitutionally designated to ensure it is spent the way it was intended — on vital repairs and improvements to Missouri’s roads and bridges.My plea is to not take this issue lightly because this important decision has been kicked down the road for way too long already. Please visit the campaign website Safermo.com and learn how Missouri can win big with Proposition D.Thomas P. Schneider has been the mayor of Florissant since 2011 and was a member of the 21st Century Missouri Transportation Task Force."
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Unions challenge Missouri law making it easier to fire nearly 25,000 state workers","Oct 11, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/business/local/unions-challenge-missouri-law-making-it-easier-to-fire-nearly/article_872de04b-57cd-52b7-be9a-a20bbfbae95b.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • A coalition of Missouri labor unions is trying to block a law championed by Republican lawmakers and former Gov. Eric Greitens that makes it easier to fire state workers.In a lawsuit filed in Cole County Wednesday, the unions say the changes infringe on state workers’ collective bargaining rights, which are enshrined in the state Constitution’s Bill of Rights.“Former Governor Greitens may have thought he could throw away the hard-won rights of dedicated public service workers on his way out the door,” said Danny Homan, president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Council 61.

“But the Missouri Constitution says otherwise. We are fighting this unjust and illegal attack on the rights of our members every step of the way, and we are confident that justice will prevail.”Under the state’s merit system, most employees are hired based on their performance on standardized tests, rather than their allegiance to a particular politician or political party.The changes are part of a deal the scandal-plagued Greitens laid out in his budget proposal in February, in which he said he’d sign off on small raises for the nation’s lowest-paid state workforce if lawmakers send him legislation that could make it easier for the governor’s administration to hire, fire and reward government workers.Lawmakers included $700-per-year raises in the budget, but the increase won’t go into effect until Jan. 1.Greitens signed the bill on his final day in office before turning the reins over to Lt. Gov. Mike Parson, who also supports the changes.
In all, an estimated 25,000 state workers — nearly half of the state workforce — are affected by the new law.In the 32-page lawsuit, the unions say the law “made drastic changes to essential terms and conditions of employment for state employees by purportedly designating them as ‘at will’ employees, thereby subjecting them to termination for ‘no reason or any reason.’”
The lawsuit says the changes to employees’ work rules and conditions ignored contractual rights that had already been agreed to — in contracts that still are in effect and in contracts that expired this year.Communications Workers of America Local 6355 President Natashia Pickens called the changes an attack on workers’ rights to organize and collectively bargain.“We fight for the workers and the state is trying to alienate workers and crush the very organizations with the ability to help workers have a voice on the job,” Pickens said.As part of the rules being adopted to implement the law, officials have proposed eliminating a requirement that someone can be demoted or fired if they are found guilty of certain activities.The changes would allow a firing if a worker is merely “engaged” in certain negative activities.Brittany Ruess, spokeswoman for the Office of Administration, which is overseeing the rule changes, said the change was needed “in order to clarify that a criminal conviction is not a prerequisite to finding cause to suspend, demote or dismiss an employee for the inappropriate behaviors.”

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Group backing Missouri gas tax hike launches ad as governor prepares to lend support,"Oct 11, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/group-backing-missouri-gas-tax-hike-launches-ad-as-governor/article_e06f4d06-330d-573c-bb68-24f1e2af7005.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Armed with a robust campaign fund and no known organized opposition, supporters of raising Missouri's gasoline tax launched a 30-second television ad Thursday designed to fuel support for the 10-cent hike.The ad by SaferMo.com focuses on how the added cash will be used to make the Show-Me State's roads safer.

""Proposition D is a bargain to keep my family, and yours, safer,"" the narrator says.The ad comes as Republican Gov. Mike Parson is set to campaign for the increase next week in a series of stops throughout the state. He is tentatively scheduled to be in St. Louis on Tuesday to highlight the need for more spending on roads and bridges.Lt. Gov. Mike Kehoe, also a Republican, has been traversing the state to promote the hike for the past several weeks.
If voters approve, a 10-cent increase in Missouri's 17-cents-per-gallon motor fuel tax would be phased in over the next four years.The tax on gas and diesel would go up 2.5 cents each year starting next year, topping out at 27 cents in 2022.  The measure also would increase taxes on alternative fuels such as natural gas and propane.
Analysts say the tax hike could generate $293 million more for the state road fund when fully implemented.Transportation officials say the added money will help the state begin catching up on $825 million in unfunded road and bridge needs. The gas tax, among the lowest in the nation, has not been raised since 1996.Among projects that could be in line for funding are a revamping of traffic-choked Interstate 270 in north St. Louis County.SaferMo.com has received dozens of large political contributions since it was formed after the Legislature placed the question on the Nov. 6 ballot.Contributions of $100,000 apiece have come from the Site Advancement Foundation, the St. Louis Construction Training and Advancement Foundation and the Missouri Construction Industry Advancement Fund in Jefferson City.The biggest single donation so far has been $250,000 from the Missouri Realtors Association. Engineering firms that could see an uptick in business also have contributed.Loading...

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri making plans for renovation of state Capitol — with price tag unknown,"Oct 11, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-making-plans-for-renovation-of-state-capitol-with-price/article_c0b20565-3931-599d-b36d-1f57abb7a3bc.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • With nearly $30 million in renovations already underway on the exterior of the Missouri Capitol, a panel of state officials is now turning to what could be an expensive and long-lasting makeover of the interior of the century-old building.But the long-sought renovation of the centerpiece of Missouri government continues to face a number of hurdles, ranging from the potential cost to how long the project will take. And, there are unanswered questions about where lawmakers and their aides will go when their offices are being torn apart and rebuilt.In a meeting Tuesday, a consultant hired to map out a series of upgrades and historic fixes told state officials he wouldn’t have cost estimates until the end of December.

And the work could take as long as seven years if it is phased in and not done in one fell swoop, said David Hart, executive vice president of Salt Lake City-based MOCA.When mention of that time span raised eyebrows among members of the Missouri Capitol Commission, Hart said, “I don’t want to sound rude, but you just have to put up with it.”State officials have been mulling an overhaul of the offices, hearing rooms and marble-lined corridors that make up the nearly 500,000-square-foot building for more than a decade.In recent years, officials were considering a $35 million plan to turn the nearby Missouri Department of Transportation headquarters into an annex of the Capitol, connected via a tunnel.The move would have freed up space in the crowded first floor offices to allow workers to remove mezzanines that house freshman and minority party legislators but are inaccessible to constituents who cannot climb stairs.

Paul Fitzwater, R-Potosi, who resigned after being appointed to the state's probation and parole board. Photo by Robert Cohen, rcohen@post-dispatch.com

The mezzanines also block windows that allow natural light into the building, leaving some hallways darker than the original designers intended.Under a new plan being worked on by MOCA, Hart said the state could gain an estimated 100,000 square feet of space for lawmakers by extending the Capitol basement south toward High Street, which is Jefferson City’s main downtown street.There also could be an underground visitor center on the north side of the Capitol that could be the entry point for the estimated 450,000 people who visit the building annually.For now, however, there are no cost estimates.
“Things are fluid. Just stay tuned for the next few months,” assistant House Clerk Dana Miller told members of the commission.Commission member Sarah Steelman, who oversees the Office of Administration, would not say whether Gov. Mike Parson supported the latest version.“I think we have a long way to go. I think the cost is where the rubber meets the road,” Steelman said.In other states, similar renovation projects have been big budget items. In Utah, an overhaul of the Capitol in 2004 cost $260 million. A rehab of the Minnesota Capitol that ended last year cost $310 million.Even if lawmakers and Parson agree to move forward with the project, Rep. Scott Fitzpatrick told the commission that finding space for Capitol employees when the work is underway could cause headaches during the multiyear duration of such a project.
“It will be a political nightmare to get everyone to move out,” said the Shell Knob Republican who chairs the House Budget Committee. “I’m just trying to be realistic about it. People are going to have to be flexible.”

As for finding money to pay for the upgrades, Fitzpatrick said it could be done if people understand that the renovations are needed if the building is going to remain viable in the coming decades.“I think we can figure out a way to pay for it. I don’t want to put a Band-Aid on it,” Fitzpatrick said.Meanwhile, the exterior work is set to continue until late 2020. Workers have already enclosed much of the building in scaffolding and are repairing cracked and crumbling stone on the exterior walls.In the coming weeks, workers will surround the dome with scaffolding and remove the bronze statue of Ceres, the ancient Roman goddess of agriculture, grain crops, fertility and motherly relationships.The 1921 statue, atop the dome, will be removed with a crane and sent for a year-long cleaning and refurbishment.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Attorney forges ahead with Greitens secrecy probe, months after Hawley found no wrongdoing","Oct 10, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/attorney-forges-ahead-with-greitens-secrecy-probe-months-after-hawley/article_271b9d05-f87e-5c18-a42d-226505fb2d10.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • A St. Louis County attorney said in a Wednesday court filing that former Gov. Eric Greitens and his staffers should be forced to testify about their use of a smartphone app that automatically destroys text messages.Mark Pedroli, who sued the Greitens administration in December, said that Greitens and his team violated a May 31 court order from Cole County Circuit Judge Jon Beetem, which ordered the governor’s attorneys to turn over the names of anyone in the office who at any time downloaded or used the Confide app.Greitens’ attorneys turned over a list of 20 people who used the app, but Pedroli said in a Wednesday motion for sanctions that Greitens’ office “concealed from this Court at least seven Office of Governor persons who downloaded and/or used Confide.”

Pedroli said that because of the alleged omissions, Greitens and his staff should be forced to testify as punishment.The filing marks the latest development in Pedroli’s nine-month probe of Greitens’ alleged violations of state open records laws, months after Attorney General Josh Hawley, who like Greitens is a Republican, found no evidence of wrongdoing. Hawley is running for U.S. Senate.Pedroli said “evidence revealed” after June 1 showed at least seven staffers who were not mentioned in the list used or downloaded the app, including deputy legislative directors Brad Green and Jeffrey Earl.“Defendants’ concealment directly challenges the authority of this Court and calls for significant sanction,” Pedroli wrote in his motion. “The former governor and some of his staff, at minimum, have long thumbed their noses at the Sunshine Law and the authority of this Court and they must be held to account.”Pedroli wants to depose Greitens, his custodian of records Michelle Hallford, general counsel Lucinda Luetkemeyer, special counsel Sarah Madden, chief of staff Mike Roche, press secretary Parker Briden, deputy chief of staff Nick Maddux and policy director Will Scharf.Hallford and Earl are the only staffers mentioned in the filing who still work in the governor’s office, now led by Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican.Pedroli also wants to depose the seven people concealed from the list “and any other person this Court believes is responsible for the evasive, incomplete or deceptive responses.”
Pedroli has released copies of screenshots he obtained during discovery that he says show the governor’s office used the Confide app to discuss substantial public business.The Kansas City Star reported last month that Greitens’ staff discussed Confide among themselves, and with people outside of the governor’s office.Pedroli said deposing witnesses would allow him to determine “the breadth and the scope” of Confide’s use in the governor’s office.“Evidence continues to pour in demonstrating the use of Confide to conduct public business in the Greitens administration,” Pedroli told the Star. “Based on comments of others in and around government, I’m wondering if any public business was conducted on the record.”
Pedroli, on behalf of his client Ben Sansone of the Sunshine Project, has continued his probe despite Hawley’s report in March that found no evidence of wrongdoing on the part of the Greitens administration.Hawley complained that he did not have subpoena power as he investigated Greitens. He issued a report on March 2 containing no evidence of wrongdoing, but his office only interviewed a handful of Greitens staffers and did not attempt to interview Greitens.Hawley also did not attempt to obtain text messages by Greitens staffers that were not deleted, and his office did not try to reconstruct messages deleted by the app.Pedroli, meanwhile, filed a lawsuit against the governor’s office when it denied his Sunshine request last December — and copies of text messages he gleaned during discovery show, he says, that the app was used for substantial public business in violation of the law.Pedroli thinks Hawley failed to aggressively investigate.“A lawsuit should’ve been filed, which would’ve given him the subpoena power that he needed to get the answers to the questions under oath,” Pedroli told the Post-Dispatch. “The question that the attorney general’s office should ask itself is: How did a private attorney go ahead and get the subpoena power that he claims he couldn’t get?”

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Gordo: Dream of MLS in St. Louis is alive, but it's not just about soccer","Oct 10, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/sports/columns/jeff-gordon/gordo-dream-of-mls-in-st-louis-is-alive-but/article_53a7b375-025a-5d3a-ab14-081a0b355639.html,"The Taylor family has built the area’s biggest privately owned company, Enterprise Holdings, and a legacy just as large.Family members have donated hundreds of millions to support Forest Park, the St. Louis Symphony, the Gateway Arch grounds renovations, various local charities and professional sports as well.That civic commitment began many years ago through company founder Jack Taylor, who died in 2016. It continues today with the renewed initiative to build a downtown soccer stadium and land a Major League Soccer expansion team.

“My father started our business here in St. Louis 62 years ago with $25,000 in borrowed money, in partnership with the Lindburg Cadillac family,” said Andy Taylor, executive chairman of Enterprise Holdings. “Our business has become a global business, based here in St. Louis.“It’s a total, absolute privilege for us to be able to do some of these things. We love St. Louis and this (MLS quest) just makes sense.”Fans in every city rely on franchise owners to attract teams and keep them competitive. St. Louis has seen good, bad and ugly ownership groups in recent decades.Bill DeWitt Jr. assembled a model ownership group while buying the Cardinals from Anheuser-Busch in 1995. DeWitt and Co. plowed through political resistance to eventually build Busch Stadium III and launch the Ballpark Village project.After Bill Bidwill moved the football Cardinals to Phoenix following the 1987 season, St. Louis failed to attract an NFL expansion team because of conflicting ownership bids. Then native Missourian Stan Kroenke helped engineer the work-around, partnering with Georgia Frontiere to move the Rams here from Los Angeles in 1995.Fans had high hopes for Kroenke when he succeeded Frontiere as majority owner. But he ultimately bailed on the city — insulting it vigorously on his way out — to move the team back to LA in 2016.“Compared to all other U.S. cities,” Kroenke argued in his relocation application to the NFL, “St. Louis is struggling.”The Blues endured an unfortunate ownership history until Tom Stillman’s group rescued the team from Dave Checketts and his cash-poor group in 2012. Andy Taylor and Jo Anne Taylor Kindle joined Stillman, World Wide Technology CEO Jim Kavanaugh and other investors to provide financial stability.The Taylors increased their support this year, with Enterprise buying naming rights for the team’s downtown arena.“When the Scottrade name went away on the Enterprise Center, it made good sense for us,” Andy Taylor said. “It was a good business deal besides being the right thing to do. Our 6,000 employees in the area, when they go to the hockey games, they can be proud their name is on it.”
Now Taylor family members are joining the persistent Kavanaugh to revive the downtown soccer stadium project and bid for a Major League Soccer expansion team. The project was dead until Andy Taylor approached Kavanaugh to discuss it.“I didn’t know if he was serious,” Kavanaugh said. “So we met. I filled him in on what needed to be done to really make this work. We continued to talk and the more we talked, the more we collectively got excited about what this could mean for St. Louis.“We connected all the dots on the investment side and felt that this was a really strong local investor group that is interested in doing great things for the city of St. Louis and soccer.”
This time around, financing for the proposed 20,000-seat, $250 million stadium will largely come from private sources. The only taxes would be site-specific, so this initiative will not require a city-wide vote like the one that failed in the city in April 2017.There is no $60 million handout in this proposal. So Lewis Reed, president of the Board of Aldermen, is on board along with St. Louis Mayor Lyda Krewson and Missouri Gov. Mike Parson.“The MLS opportunity really isn’t just about the sport,” Andy Taylor said. “It’s about redevelopment, and being part of the resurgence that is happening in St. Louis. And boy, oh boy, it’s happening, it is for real.”Carolyn Kindle Betz, senior vice president of Enterprise Holdings and executive director of the Enterprise Holdings Foundation, will head the potential majority ownership group. It will also include Enterprise chief operating officer Christine Taylor-Broughton and other members of the Taylor family.Assuming this stadium project clears all political hurdles, this potential ownership group will have a compelling case to get one of the two MLS expansion teams up for grabs. The league has been interested in this market for years.“We’re going to focus all of our efforts on showing them that St. Louis is indeed the best city for a club, and that we want the club, and we can support a club,” said Kindle Betz, a granddaughter of Jack Taylor and a niece of Andy Taylor.So this bid is viable. The persistent Kavanaugh and the generous Taylors have thrust St. Louis back into the game. What a turn of events this was.While other companies and other business leaders have given up on this city, the Taylors have remained steadfast with their support. St. Louis sports fans can be thankful for that.“Carolyn is leading the third generation on this effort, five women,” Andy Taylor said. “This is a multi-generational family business. I think we’re good for another generation. We’re not going anywhere.”

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Soccer gets another shot in St. Louis as family that owns Enterprise launches bid for MLS team,"Oct 10, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/business/local/soccer-gets-another-shot-in-st-louis-as-family-that/article_f77a29a7-9a97-577e-84ea-92107ace964c.html,"ST. LOUIS • For those who thought the city’s ambitions of becoming a Major League Soccer town died at the ballot box last year, there is hope — and its name is Taylor.A multigenerational cohort of the founding family of global car rental behemoth Enterprise Holdings is making a bid for one of the last two planned MLS expansion team slots. The Taylor family members forming the group would make the team majority-owned by women, the first in the league and one of few ownership groups controlled by women in all of professional sports.“We’ve had such a great tradition of soccer here with our youth clubs,” said Carolyn Kindle Betz, a granddaughter of Enterprise founder Jack Taylor who works as a senior vice president at Enterprise and executive director of the Clayton-based company’s charitable foundation. “We also fill a void in the Midwest if you look at how the MLS has awarded its teams in the past.”

        At an announcement ceremony Tuesday at the Mathews-Dickey Boys & Girls Club, where officials touted the relationship the nonprofit group has with the Scott Gallagher Soccer Club, Kindle Betz said her family has “a long-standing commitment to the revitalization of St. Louis” and an MLS team would leave “a lasting legacy to the city we love.”A roughly $250 million stadium dedicated to the soccer franchise would be “overwhelmingly” privately financed, the Taylors say. Public help would likely come from dedicated sales taxes on concessions and other merchandise sold to patrons, a property tax break from a city agency owning the stadium site and leasing it to the group, state tax credits and a break on the city’s 5 percent ticket tax.The Taylors are teaming with the family of Jim Kavanaugh, CEO of Maryland Heights-based World Wide Technology and a former professional soccer player who was part of last year’s failed bid to build a stadium and win a team from the growing professional soccer league. He also is part-owner of St. Louis FC, the United Soccer League franchise that plays in Fenton, which would serve as a development club if St. Louis lures an MLS team.“As you all know, the Taylor family has been soccer fanatics for a number of years,” Kavanaugh joked to the crowd.It wasn’t a long-standing love of soccer that initially drew the Taylors to form a partnership — though Kavanaugh said they are really starting to get into the sport now — but instead “because the entire Taylor family is so passionate about St. Louis.”

Enterprise, the largest privately owned company in the region, is known for its participation in sports ventures and area philanthropy. It recently took over naming rights for the Blues arena, and some of the family shares a stake in the hockey club’s ownership. Jack Taylor, who died in 2016, was said to have given some $860 million over the years to area cultural institutions such as the St. Louis Symphony and Forest Park, and charities that work with youths, such as Boys & Girls Clubs of Greater St. Louis. The Enterprise Holdings Foundation is an active philanthropic organization, and the family has been heavily involved in the Gateway Arch grounds revamp. Kindle Betz serves as chair of the Gateway Arch Park Foundation board.In recent years, the family has watched MLS develop and is confident it is in good health and will grow in popularity.“We are also a family that is very interested in the city of St. Louis,” said Andy Taylor, Kindle Betz’s uncle and executive chairman of Enterprise Holdings who formerly worked as the company’s CEO.The two stressed that, unlike last year’s effort that sought $60 million in city help from a sales tax, the request for public resources to support this MLS bid is minimal.The ownership group is in negotiations for a break on the city’s 5 percent “amusement” or ticket tax charged for sporting events, an arrangement similar to deals given to the city’s other professional sports franchises.Because they are not seeking any commitment of citywide resources, a public vote like the one that doomed the financing package for the last effort in April 2017 won’t be necessary. St. Louis aldermen would need to pass legislation approving the deal.“It’s certainly a more attractive arrangement that we’re intending and hope to come out with than the previous (MLS proposal), which was certainly more expensive for the city,” Taylor said. “This is an addition (of revenue) to the city.”Though details on the financing package are still being negotiated, St. Louis Mayor Lyda Krewson said early projections suggest the stadium could add a net $1.5 million a year to city revenue. She called it an “excellent business deal for our community.”“St. Louis is a soccer town,” she said. “We play it. We watch it. Now let’s score us a franchise.”Similar to the last MLS proposal, the Taylors and Kavanaugh are eyeing the same land just west of Union Station, along Market Street, for a downtown stadium. The land, currently owned by the Missouri Department of Transportation, is expected to be freed up as part of a revamp of the Jefferson Avenue interchange with Highway 40 (Interstate 64). A city option on the land recently expired but is expected to be renewed by the agency as soon as next month.A 20,000-seat stadium could cost around $250 million total, according to information from the group. The city’s Land Clearance for Redevelopment Authority would own the stadium and the MLS team would operate under a long-term lease, resulting in an exemption from property taxes.
A tax on concessions and other sales within the stadium could contribute to its operation, according to information that was on an early version of the group’s website accessed Monday, though Taylor and Kindle Betz said it would be overwhelmingly privately financed. Taxing districts allowing up to a 3 percent charge on sales within the stadium could help pay for its operation and construction.Soccer fans “might pay an additional 3 cents on your $1 hot dog,” Krewson said, but only users of the stadium would be paying that tax.There are also talks to establish a fund to help with future stadium upkeep and renovations, or to repurpose or demolish it should something happen to the team or league. That could help allay fears of a repeat of last year’s heavy political lift, criticized by some elected officials, to update the publicly owned Enterprise Center (then Scottrade Center) where the Blues play.The group is also seeking state tax credits — around $15 million in 2018 and 2019 according to a past version of the group’s website — to help prepare the MoDOT site for development. That’s similar to the $40 million the last ownership group had sought from the state in 2016, a plan that sank after former Gov. Eric Greitens expressed opposition to it following his election in November.

An official in Gov. Mike Parson’s administration previously told the Post-Dispatch it is interested in working on a stadium proposal.
St. Louis Comptroller Darlene Green expressed tentative support.“St. Louis has a strong history in U.S. soccer, and I welcome the renewed effort to seek an MLS expansion team,” she said in a statement. “I look forward to reviewing the financing proposal and my office stands ready to help ensure it is fiscally responsible for city taxpayers.”Aldermanic President Lewis Reed, in attendance at the announcement Tuesday, was confident city legislators would back the plan.“I think it has good legislative support,” he told the Post-Dispatch. “The last deal put a lot more of the burden on taxpayers.”Alderman Christine Ingrassia, whose 6th Ward includes the proposed stadium site, was there Tuesday and called the proposed plan “the model of what a public-private partnership should look like.”But first, the group needs to secure a franchise.“It’s getting to the point where if we’re going to do something with MLS, there’s not many team slots left,” Taylor said. “Right now we’ve just got to get the club and things will start falling together.”The league has previously charged a $150 million franchise fee, though Taylor said the league is being “purposely vague” on a final figure. But the group did hear back from the league just Monday.“They told us they are very interested in our proposals,” Taylor said.MLS has said it wants to grow the league to 28 teams, meaning two slots are left following the pending additions of Cincinnati, Miami and Nashville, Tenn. St. Louis could be going up against Detroit, San Diego, Phoenix and Las Vegas for one of those two teams.In a statement, Dan Courtemanche, MLS executive vice president of communications, said the league was “impressed by their commitment to the MLS effort. We look forward to spending time with them during the coming months to learn more about their plan.”The MLS Board of Governors is scheduled to meet in mid-December in New York, though the league said there is no set schedule for awarding the final two franchises.Taylor said a timeline is still in flux but that he hopes the league could make a decision within months.“Figuring out a calendar here is difficult, but I’m not getting any younger so I want this to happen soon,” Taylor said.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Lawsuit targets lobbyist gift ban in Missouri governor's office,"Oct 9, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/lawsuit-targets-lobbyist-gift-ban-in-missouri-governor-s-office/article_b51fefb9-4c0b-5a87-b987-d9605562f421.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • A Virginia-based law firm is suing Missouri Gov. Mike Parson over an executive order banning employees in the governor’s office from accepting gifts from lobbyists.In a lawsuit filed in federal court last week, the Institute for Justice said the ban on gift-giving violates the organization’s First Amendment rights to free speech because it prohibits them from giving workers in Parson’s office two books.“IJ cannot freely distribute its publications to communicate with state employees of the executive branch because those employees must reject the publications, purchase the publications, or be subject to disciplinary action, up to termination of employment, for knowingly accepting IJ’s publications from lobbyists,” the complaint states.

For years, state lawmakers have been unable to agree on regulations that could end or put limits on freebies handed out by lobbyists.In 2017, in one of his first acts, former Gov. Eric Greitens issued Executive Order 17-02 barring gifts to his employees. After Parson took over in June, he kept the order in place, despite previously being the lone statewide officer who accepted gifts.
His spokeswoman signaled Tuesday the governor isn’t planning to change the policy.
“The Governor’s Office does not comment on pending litigation, but pursuant to Executive Order 17-02, the governor and his staff will not accept lobbyist gifts,” Kelli Jones said.The institute advocates for libertarian causes, including school choice, civil forfeiture reform and loosening regulations on hair braiders.The suit comes as Missouri voters will get a chance to vote on a referendum Nov. 6 that would bar lawmakers from accepting gifts worth more than $5.Supporters of the change said lobbyists distributed more than $1 million worth of gifts in 2017, the highest reported total since 2006.

Claire McCaskill is now considering a run for governor.Paperwork filed with the Missouri Ethics Commission shows Tony Monetti formed an exploratory committee to run in the August 2020 gubernatorial race.Monetti has not filed a financial report showing whether he has raised  money for the run.

Gov. Mike Parson, who took over as Missouri’s chief executive in June following the departure of scandal-plagued Gov. Eric Greitens, has not said he is seeking election to a full term.In a September interview on his farm in Bolivar, Parson told the Post-Dispatch he would be happy if he successfully serves out the remainder of his current term.But, he didn’t rule out seeking another four years at the helm of state government.“I’ve got at least two-and-a-half years to get some things done. Whenever it’s over, I’m going to sit out here and look at cows,” Parson said.In the GOP primary for U.S. Senate, Monetti received 9.75 percent of the vote in an 11-way race won easily by Attorney General Josh Hawley.
Monetti is a graduate of the U.S. Air Force Academy and served in the Air Force, where he flew the B-2 stealth bomber.Monetti also was an assistant dean of aviation at the University of Central Missouri. He resigned from that job to make his run for the Senate.
The political newcomer raised nearly $450,000 during the race, Federal Elections Commission records show.Although vastly outspent by Hawley, Monetti did wrangle a high profile endorsement when former vice presidential nominee and Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin campaigned for him during an appearance in Kansas City.Monetti did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday.Others who are listed in Missouri Ethics Commission records as running for governor in 2020 include Greitens and Republican state Rep. T.J. Berry of Kearney.Berry said Monday he is not seriously considering a run for governor.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Missouri revenue lags, but budget cuts not on horizon","Oct 2, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-revenue-lags-but-budget-cuts-not-on-horizon/article_4a3ee297-8a5f-586f-89f7-b28df56661c0.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Tax revenues fell short of expectations during the first quarter of Missouri’s fiscal year, but the state’s budget chief says he sees no need to start limiting spending.In a report released Tuesday, tax revenue for the first three months of the fiscal year was down by 3.2 percent, with much of the decrease coming via a drop in individual income tax collections.In prior years, that might have triggered mid-stream cuts in spending out of the state’s $28.3 billion checkbook, said budget director Dan Haug.

For example, revenue shortfalls in 2016 led former Gov. Jay Nixon to withhold more than $150 million in spending in his final months in office. Former Gov. Eric Greitens slashed $250 million in spending in 2017 when revenue figures lagged.Among the cuts imposed by Greitens was a reduction in school busing costs and cuts to universities.But, Haug said the state ended the last fiscal year on June 30 with higher-than-anticipated revenue growth. Budget writers had planned on revenue growing by 1.9 percent last year, but the final figure was closer to 5 percent.“That’s given us a big cushion. We feel we’re okay at where we are right now,” Haug said.In addition, the House and Senate approved $100 million to pay for supplemental spending, which also provides another layer of security against current Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican, having to cut spending.
“Right now, we seem to be in a pretty good place,” Haug said.Haug said the drop in tax collections may be due to a change in reporting times under the federal tax cut package approved by Congress.
But, he said a strong economy should result in a rebound as the fiscal year goes forward.“I think revenue will be stronger in the second half of the year,” Haug said.He added that the additional revenue received last year means the state can meet its current budget needs if revenue grows by just .3 percent.Nonetheless, Haug said the budget office is watching the situation to determine if spending cuts will be needed.“We’re paying close attention to it. We’re continuing to monitor it. But right now, I don’t think it’s necessary,” he said.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Will we step up as a region for soccer stadium?,"Sep 29, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/mailbag/will-we-step-up-as-a-region-for-soccer-stadium/article_5245655a-c93f-586d-9cb6-6600ce8a71c2.html,"With Missouri Gov. Mike Parson's expression of interest in a Major League Soccer stadium in our area, the question arises as it has before: will we step up as a two-state, multicounty region to support this important economic development initiative? Or will it once again be just one state with perhaps one county or city participating, a formula that failed with the earlier soccer stadium proposal and before that with a National Football League stadium?Will the state of Illinois, St. Louis city, St. Louis County, St. Charles County and St. Clair County step up? After all, many soccer fans are residents of these jurisdictions. Or will they continue to be “free riders” on the backs of residents of the participating jurisdictions?

And will Bi-State and East-West Gateway, each with their regionwide economic development mandate (and Bi-State with its bonding authority), be helpful this time around? Or will they just sit it out as they have on prior opportunities that have screamed out for a truly regional approach?
It’s time, folks, for regional leadership to emerge and make truly regional economic development happen with this soccer stadium opportunity and many more opportunities to come.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Editorial: Missouri is failing domestic violence victims. The good news is, it's fixable.","Sep 29, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-missouri-is-failing-domestic-violence-victims-the-good-news/article_1c618348-6a0b-5dc8-8665-250cb6cf77e4.html,"In 2017, more than 45,000 Missourians reported incidents of domestic violence. In about 28,000 of those cases, the victims — usually women and children — were unable to obtain shelter or other requested services because of inefficient and uneven distribution of domestic violence funding across the state.That’s according to a recent state audit that shows Missouri is failing badly in this important area. The problem isn’t just inadequate funding but a more frustrating issue: bureaucratic morass that is preventing existing funds from getting to the people they’re meant to serve.The audit provides a list of common-sense, uncontroversial fixes that deal largely with cutting red tape and allowing more efficient disbursement of funds. Missouri’s leaders should read it cover to cover and get moving on its recommendations.

One of the first and most important things domestic violence victims need is somewhere to go — immediately — when staying home isn’t a safe option. It is in this crucial area that Missouri’s failure is most apparent. As the report by state Auditor Nicole Galloway notes, Missouri has just two domestic violence shelters for every three counties.And even among those existing shelters, services are hampered by funding lapses caused in part by burdensome and duplicative regulations on the shelters, and inefficiency in the way state and federal funds are disbursed to those shelters via local governments.
“State statutes regarding the distribution requirements for domestic violence fees collected are burdensome and unclear, resulting in a lack of compliance with requirements, and some county funds going undistributed,” the audit states.
As Galloway put it in a news conference: “Victims of domestic violence shouldn’t be turned away because red tape is holding up shelter funding. Unfortunately, that’s happening in Missouri.”Another problem is that state law doesn’t specify requirements for how or when local authorities are supposed to distribute funding to the shelters. This “decentralized” system, the audit says, means “funds are not being distributed where there is a demand for services,” with some counties just holding onto unused funds rather than getting them to other counties that might have unmet funding needs.Recommendations in the audit include rewriting documentation requirements for the shelters to make them easier to follow, and revamping the funding disbursement system so money isn’t sitting unused in one place while it’s needed somewhere else.Not that more funding wouldn’t always help, but how refreshing to be told that much of Missouri’s failure here could be turned around before spending the first additional dollar. The audit charts a clear path. Gov. Mike Parson and legislators should start fixing this eminently fixable problem as soon as possible."
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Boeing's St. Louis plant wins major $9.2 billion contract for new Air Force training jet,"Sep 28, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/business/local/boeing-s-st-louis-plant-wins-major-billion-contract-for/article_29acfa46-3c71-51f3-992f-5ebd95e682a8.html,"Updated at 5:40 p.m.In a generational win for Boeing Co.’s north St. Louis County manufacturing operations, the U.S. Department of Defense on Thursday awarded the company a contract worth up to $9.2 billion to build the Air Force’s new training jet.The contract, which is expected to extend until 2034, should secure the future of Boeing’s St. Louis operations and the 14,000 regional jobs they support for more than a decade. Combined with the uptick of foreign and U.S. Navy purchases of the plant’s signature fighter jet — the F/A-18 Super Hornet — the T-X Trainer contract represents a reversal of fortune for an assembly line whose future seemed tenuous only a few years ago.
















        
            Big military budget refuels St. Louis-built Super Hornet

A few years ago, many feared the Super Hornet assembly line here would already be gone. 




“They were concerned with the numbers going down here in St. Louis off the line,” said Jeff Windau, an analyst at Des Peres-based Edward Jones who follows Boeing. “That’s a pretty significant piece of what the trainer brings here in St. Louis, just more runway from a manufacturing” standpoint.Boeing teamed with Sweden’s Saab AB to develop a new plane for the competition, beating out Lockheed Martin Corp. and Leonardo DRS. Boeing had said last year that the T-X Trainer would be assembled at its North County campus, where it has produced the Navy’s workhorse Super Hornet fighters for 20 years.The Air Force plans to purchase 351 of the T-X jets, and the military will be able to purchase up to 475 aircraft and 120 ground-based training systems, according to the DOD contract announcement.The win is significant for Boeing, which reorganized its defense business more than a year ago, including moving its headquarters and top executives from St. Louis to the Washington area, in the hopes of a “franchise level” win such as the trainer.“Today’s announcement is the culmination of years of unwavering focus by the Boeing and Saab team,” Leanne Caret, president and CEO, Boeing Defense, Space & Security said in a statement. “It is a direct result of our joint investment in developing a system centered on the unique requirements of the U.S. Air Force. We expect T-X to be a franchise program for much of this century.”

Boeing beat out Lockheed, which was offering a modified version of its T-50 training jet developed jointly with Korea Aerospace Industries Ltd. and also beat Italy’s Leonardo DRS, which offered the T-100, a modified version of the Italian aerospace company’s M-346.“I have expected all along that Boeing was the front-runner because it had the only plane that was designed specifically for the T-X competition,” said Loren Thompson, COO of the Lexington Institute, a Washington-area think tank on security issues that counts Boeing among its contributors.The Air Force wants to replace its aging fleet of T-38 planes, which are nearly 50 years old, and analysts have said it could eventually buy up to 600 planes.
“Missouri has had a rich history of supporting aerospace ventures, from Charles Lindbergh, to the Mercury space program, to the latest innovation represented by the T-X,” Missouri Gov. Mike Parson said in a statement following the announcement. “We look forward to working with Boeing to provide support for the training of its skilled workforce and other incentives that will allow Boeing to meet its obligations to the U.S. Air Force.”While not initially expected to be a huge net boost to St. Louis area jobs, the contract is expected to secure the future of the company’s St. Louis assembly line, which had been passed over for new fighter and bomber contracts. Most recently, Boeing had hoped to win a major long-range bomber contract that was awarded in 2015 to rival Northrop Grumman Corp. And the wind-down of Super Hornet purchases as the Air Force and Navy looked to the new F-35 joint strike fighter made by Lockheed Martin put its future as a military jet maker in doubt.

Boeing had teamed up with Lockheed Martin for $50 billion contract





But with a slower-than-expected adoption of the F-35 by the Navy, Boeing has continued to get Super Hornet orders, recently winning a contract to extend the flying life of older Super Hornets and upgrading their systems. The federal budget also included 24 new Super Hornets in both the 2018 and 2019 budgets, and the Navy says it wants to buy dozens more. That will keep Super Hornet production humming into the middle of next decade.Last month, Boeing won a contract worth up to $805 million to build the MQ-25A Stingray, the Navy’s first unmanned aerial refueling drone. That work will be mostly performed here, bringing the company’s local production line into the unmanned age.“Boeing’s had a nice resurgence in military jet production in the last few years,” said Richard Aboulafia, a military aircraft analyst for the Teal Group.














        
            Refueling drone could be big contract for Boeing St. Louis plant

Boeing has already built a prototype of the drone designed for aircraft carriers and it expects to hear whether it wins the contract by this summer. 




Had the St. Louis facility run out of orders, the military faced a situation where only one location — Lockheed Martin’s Texas operations — assembled fighter jets.Winning the T-X contract became “critical” for Boeing after it missed out on big military awards in past years, said Windau, the Edward Jones analyst.“The defense business is a smaller piece of its overall portfolio, but I think it is still a significant win for them,” he said. “Over the last year or so, things have gotten onto a more solid footing for the fighter business.”Reuters contributed to this report.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Robberson: It's candidate endorsement time. Why do editorial boards do this?,"Sep 27, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/columnists/robberson-it-s-candidate-endorsement-time-why-do-editorial-boards/article_70f30d44-ee64-5094-b443-2d9c8e4f05d3.html,"It’s election time again, which means endorsement time for this newspaper. Which means a lot of people will be upset when we don’t see it their way regarding the candidate we recommend for major elective offices. Elections are all about differences of opinion. Relax, it’s democracy, not war.The most important thing for readers to remember with endorsements is that we are not handicapping this election as if predicting the winner in a football game. We don’t know any better than you who will win any given race. And after the outcome of the 2016 presidential and Missouri gubernatorial elections, many voters have learned that the best candidate isn’t always the person who ultimately gets the job or whom the polls projected as the likely winner.Our editorial board does its best with a small staff and grueling daily schedule to bring in as many candidates as we can for hour-long interview sessions. The questions we ask are designed to test candidates on their breadth of knowledge about the office, preparation on the major issues the office deals with, and candidates’ ability to engage in intense discussion while keeping the conversation civil.

We also want to know whether their political values align with this newspaper’s modern editorial priorities as well as the time-honored traditions outlined in The Platform, Joseph Pulitzer’s 1907 declaration that we publish on our editorial pages every day.But a candidate’s alignment with us is not necessarily a deal-breaker. If, say, a Republican candidate disagrees with us editorially but is more civil, better informed and politically engaged than his or her opponent, that’s someone we definitely can endorse.We poke for holes in their arguments and try to force them to go deeper than mere surface knowledge to make sure candidates aren’t merely reciting talking points by rote memory. This experience rattles and flusters some candidates. In 2016, then-gubernatorial candidate Eric Greitens lost his cool simply because I asked him, in response to his plan for an urban anti-crime initiative, whether he supported police stop-and-frisk policies.“You’re making my head hurt,” he complained, insisting that Missourians don’t care about that stuff. Later, still flustered, Greitens got in my face while we were standing in the Post-Dispatch newsroom. Reporters were watching. He left and never came back.We don’t play favorites. We put Greitens’ Democratic opponent, then-Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster, through the same wringer. Koster left our building red-faced and angry, accusing me of asking “gotcha” questions.
Our editorial board split on whom to endorse but wound up supporting Koster because Greitens came off as untrustworthy, uninformed, insincere and a political opportunist. Voters disagreed and elected him. Greitens was able to complete fewer than 18 months in office before resigning in disgrace amid multiple criminal investigations.We didn’t endorse Greitens’ successor, Gov. Mike Parson, when he ran for lieutenant governor, but we were careful in our endorsement not to criticize him because he struck us as sincere, earnest and likable. We had no major argument with him, but his Democratic opponent had positions closer to those we’ve advocated editorially. Parson took no offense. He keeps in touch with us, sends us an occasional op-ed, and recently made a point of visiting our offices for a chat.
In the race for the Metro East 12th District congressional race, we chose Republican incumbent Mike Bost over his inexperienced and unprepared Democratic challenger in 2016. But we made a point of holding onto the recordings and notes of Bost’s remarks — including his criticisms of then-presidential candidate Donald Trump. This year, we’re measuring Bost on whether he honored his promises and stayed true to his values — exactly as Illinois voters should do.We’ve repeatedly asked Rep. Ann Wagner, R-Ballwin, to come talk to us. She has declined, despite having received our endorsement in 2012. All we want is to hear her explanations about her political choices, including her reversal after initially rejecting Trump’s presidential bid.So why does the editorial board go through this contentious exercise? First and foremost, we recognize that voters rarely have the time to attend all the campaign rallies and public debates to fully inform themselves about the candidates. And even in those forums, the candidates aren’t always pressed on the issues they need to address. We do our best to fill in the gaps and serve as the eyes and ears of our readers.To reiterate: We are not picking winners and losers. All we’re trying to do is tell readers that we’ve spent a lot of time investigating these candidates and hammering them with tough questions designed to test their knowledge and preparedness. This is our assessment.Many readers take our recommendations with them to the voting booth. Some use it, as it’s designed, to better inform themselves. Others call in to boast that they deliberately vote against the candidates we recommend, as if to punish us. The latter do themselves — and democracy — a disservice."

Mike Parson planned to speak Thursday at the Governor’s Conference on Tourism in St. Charles about the record year for Missouri tourism in 2017. 

Last year, tourism generated an all-time record $16.8 billion in economic impact, 42 million visitors, and more than 313,362 jobs were associated with tourism, according to the Missouri Division of Tourism.

The annual Governor’s Conference on Tourism, sponsored by the Missouri Division of Tourism, is attended by members of the tourism industry from throughout the state.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Soccer stadium talks back on in St. Louis,"Sep 27, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/business/local/soccer-stadium-talks-back-on-in-st-louis/article_d66a9e8e-1439-57be-be85-b697715d6b79.html,"St. Louis hasn’t given up on major league soccer.An official in Gov. Mike Parson’s office told the Post-Dispatch that officials with the state Department of Economic Development met with Major League Soccer representatives as recently as Tuesday, and that the Parson administration was interested in working on a stadium proposal.The Parson official did not immediately know which St. Louis sites were under consideration nor how many times state officials had met with MLS representatives. The official had no information on construction plans, timelines or who else might be involved with discussions.

A DED spokeswoman said the department “cannot comment on active negotiations.”St. Louis Mayor Lyda Krewson confirmed there was still local interest in the MLS.“I know there is a group trying to bring a team here,” Krewson said in a statement. “We are hopeful that it will come to fruition. It’s a complex process and it’s too early to comment right now.”The meeting with state officials follows a recent statement by Major League Soccer Commissioner Don Garber that St. Louis remained a potential expansion team city, even after voters in April 2017 rejected public funding for a stadium.Earlier this month, Garber talked about league expansion and once again put St. Louis in the mix, saying the city has “been floating around a little bit” as a potential city to get one of two new teams.It’s likely to be the beginning of another drawn-out process in which MLS officials seek to engage with municipal leaders about potentially helping to fund a soccer stadium to pave the way for a team.St. Louis, of course, is familiar with the narrative.The city was broadly seen as one of the strongest contenders to land one of the soccer league’s first two expansion teams. But the league last year chose Nashville and Cincinnati, leaving the door open for two additional expansion cities.St. Louis’ previous bid, led by an ownership group that included area businessmen Dave Peacock and Jim Kavanaugh along with Boston businessman Paul Edgerley, was largely undone by St. Louis voters who rejected a use tax on businesses to help fund a downtown soccer stadium. The facility would have been built just west of Union Station on land that is now the 22nd Street exit off Highway 40 (Interstate 64).Expansion cities
Garber, in his most recent comments, also mentioned Detroit, San Diego, Charlotte, Las Vegas and Phoenix as cities the league is still considering.“We’ll engage with all of those cities but we don’t have any hierarchy or pecking order, if you will, because it kinda moves around, where they are with their discussions with their specific stadiums, how their ownership groups are coming together and how it all kinda plays out with a well-rounded league for us, in terms of covering as much of the country and Canada as we can,” he told The Tennessean newspaper.The league in 2015 announced plans to expand to 28 teams. Nashville and Cincinnati were teams 25 and 26. Garber previously said he was “confident” St. Louis would get an expansion team in the league if the stadium got public financing.“We continue to believe that with the right ownership group, stadium plan and support from the corporate community, St. Louis could be a successful Major League Soccer market,” MLS Executive Vice President Dan Courtemanche said in a statement Wednesday.The previous St. Louis ownership group, called SC STL, had offered to pay $95 million to help build a 22,000-seat soccer stadium, as well as cover any maintenance and operations costs for 30 years, plus a $150 million fee to the MLS for the expansion franchise. Public funding would have totaled $60 million.
More than half of city voters rejected the ballot proposition that would have provided the public’s portion of the stadium financing plan.‘A collective effort’It’s unclear who would be part of an ownership group for a new plan brewing for a soccer stadium in St. Louis. “I’d say that the League would love to be here and that the (stadium) site identified still sits vacant,” Peacock told the Post-Dispatch. “Beyond that, it’s all I know.”The Taylor family, owners of Clayton-based rental car giant Enterprise Holdings, has been a big backer of sports efforts in St. Louis in recent years. In May, Enterprise landed naming rights for the former Scottrade Center — home of the St. Louis Blues NHL hockey team — and the facility was renamed Enterprise Center.One of Enterprise’s car rental brands, National Car Rental, was to be the moniker on a riverfront football stadium proposed in 2015 that never materialized.Asked whether the Taylor family is part of revived efforts for a soccer stadium in St. Louis, Enterprise spokeswoman Laura Bryant said in an email to the Post-Dispatch: “St. Louis has a rich soccer tradition and history. Of course we’d love for the city to get a soccer team and are among the many people who believe the city would benefit from having one here. But to do so will take a concerted and collective effort by a number of people and organizations, so it is premature to comment on any specific efforts to do so.”A city economic development arm’s option to purchase the downtown site where the last stadium proposal was planned is close to expiring. An affiliate for the St. Louis Land Clearance for Redevelopment Authority entered a two-year option agreement with the Missouri Highways and Transportation Commission in September 2016 to buy some 30 acres west of Union Station.Garber, the MLS commissioner, has said the league likes downtown stadiums, and the Missouri Department of Transportation land that the prior stadium backers had hoped to build on is likely to become available when an anticipated new interchange is built at Jefferson Avenue and Highway 40 (Interstate 64). The project is one the city has committed to in order to help traffic flow from the new National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency north of downtown.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Advocates want Gov. Mike Parson to give Hawley subpoena power in Catholic clergy probe,"Sep 26, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/advocates-want-gov-mike-parson-to-give-hawley-subpoena-power/article_a9f68440-267f-5991-b23c-ea25cafb87fc.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Advocates for survivors of Catholic clergy sex abuse gathered outside the state Capitol on Wednesday urging Gov. Mike Parson to give Attorney General Josh Hawley subpoena power in his ongoing investigation of possible sex crimes within the Catholic Church.The attorney general's office told the Post-Dispatch last week that it can gain special prosecutor status — and thus, subpoena power — with the help of either the governor or a local prosecutor who requests aid.“Yes, there are procedures through which a local prosecutor and/or the governor can initiate a process that would result in our office being appointed special prosecutor,” Daniel Hartman, Hawley's chief of staff, said in a statement. “However, our office has no legal authority to initiate those procedures and thus it would require action by a local prosecutor or the governor on their own initiative.”

But on Wednesday afternoon, Parson's office cast doubt on his ability to name Hawley special prosecutor, saying the governor first needed a request from a local prosecutor seeking assistance.""Until then, our office lacks the Constitutional and statutory authority to compel any further actions,"" Kelli Jones, Parson's spokeswoman, said in a statement. ""The Governor fully supports the Attorney General's independent review on this extremely important matter.""State law says: ""When directed by the governor, the attorney general, or one of his assistants, shall aid any prosecuting or circuit attorney in the discharge of their respective duties in the trial courts and in examinations before grand juries, and when so directed by the trial court, he may sign indictments in lieu of the prosecuting attorney.""Hawley announced an investigation into the state’s dioceses last month. The announcement followed the release of a Pennsylvania grand jury report that uncovered widespread abuse of more than 1,000 children by more than 300 priests over a period of 70 years.
But Hawley has said he lacks criminal jurisdiction, and is relying on the state's four dioceses to cooperate voluntarily with his investigation. The St. Louis-based Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, or SNAP, also delivered a letter to Parson's office on Wednesday. The administration had no immediate comment.
Tim Lennon, president of SNAP, has gone so far as to call Hawley's investigation of possible abuse a ""sham"" because he does not have the subpoena power to compel testimony and the production of documents.Hawley's office said that it is searching of a mechanism in state law that would allow it to subpoena the church, if the office decided that was the right course.At the moment, any action Hawley takes is amplified by his ongoing bid to unseat U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., this November. Advocates have urged Hawley to avoid politicizing the probe in the heat of campaign season.Hawley's office has cautioned that its probe will take time because of the volume of records attorneys must examine. Officials said last week they had identified at least 100 boxes of records that can each hold about 2,000 documents across the state's four dioceses.SNAP also wants Hawley to expand his investigation to include priests that have ""quietly"" been sent to Missouri to live at church facilities after allegations of child molestation surfaced.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Citing success in other cities, Lewis Reed urges St. Louis to adopt anti-violence program","Sep 26, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/citing-success-in-other-cities-lewis-reed-urges-st-louis/article_363602d2-bb0d-5a13-a2fa-6d4bdc187b1b.html,"ST. LOUIS • Aldermanic President Lewis Reed is calling on city officials to adopt a nationally known program to curb violence in St. Louis, citing the project’s success in cities including Boston and Chicago.The “Operation Ceasefire” initiative was first developed in Boston in the 1990s by criminologist David M. Kennedy, and the city saw a 63 percent reduction in youth homicides two years after it was implemented, prompting dozens of other cities to attempt their own versions of the program.Proponents of what is now known as Group Violence Intervention say it reduces crime through a network of law enforcement and social service providers, who engage with a small but active number of people involved in street groups.

“It would allow us to begin to break down those silos that exist between all these agencies that are all out there working to do good things for the city,” Reed said. “There are families being devastated daily by the crime happening in our city. When there’s something out there that can work, that is within our grasp, I think we should pursue it.”According to the National Network for Safe Communities — a research center directed by Kennedy that works to introduce similar anti-violence initiatives locally — readily identifiable groups of individuals commit the majority of homicides, shootings and other acts of extreme violence. Using data and shared information in a network of police, local nonprofits and service providers, high-risk individuals can be targeted for resources and support and deterred from violence.Reed announced on Wednesday that he had been in contact with the U.S. Department of Justice and St. Louis Public Safety Director Jimmie Edwards about the program, and that he also had support from organizations such as the NAACP and Civic Progress.His announcement comes in the wake of six homicides in the city in a 24-hour period. St. Louis Police Chief John Hayden and Mayor Lyda Krewson have already called on the public to help them solve the crimes.
“Going into Friday afternoon, we were 25 homicides down compared to last year, so we were trending in the right direction,” Hayden said on Monday. “Now we are 19 homicides behind last year.”
Reed said he had been interested in bringing the program to St. Louis for several years, and floated the idea again in 2017 when the city surpassed 200 murders in a single year for the first time since 1995. There hasn’t been any real momentum before now, he said.“Everyone is working hard and doing their best, but this tool begins to focus all of that energy, and begins to unify that energy, in a way that will address our public safety issues in a much more meaningful way, taking many more guns off the streets,” Reed said. “This gives us that structure.”Reed said Edwards was receptive to exploring the idea, but it’s unclear if the city will ultimately take steps to implement the program in St. Louis. Edwards could not be reached for comment.Reed could not offer an estimate of the program’s cost, but he argues that most of the money is already in the city’s public safety budget and could be paid for with “a realignment of resources.”Discussion of the program is on the agenda for a meeting between Reed and Missouri Gov. Mike Parson this week. A spokesman for Krewson said that she did not connect with Reed before he gave a news conference about the program on Wednesday but that they would try to talk soon.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Gov. Mike Parson calls for reforming troubled tax credit program, names two to housing board","Sep 24, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/gov-mike-parson-calls-for-reforming-troubled-tax-credit-program/article_4f67c888-7f4f-5610-8274-73ae607c5be3.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Gov. Mike Parson on Monday named two men to the Missouri Housing Development Commission, which oversees controversial low-income development tax credits.Allies of former Gov. Eric Greitens, a Republican, stopped the state's participation in the program last December, keeping Missouri from matching some $140 million in federal low-income housing tax credits.Parson, also a Republican, was a backer of the credits and opposed Greitens' move, which sent waves through the state's development community. Greitens resigned in June, and Parson was elevated to the state's top job.

The program has long been criticized for inefficiencies, but Parson has praised the credits' role in spurring development in poor areas.
Parson named Mark Elliff, of Carthage, and Rick McDowell, of Parkville, to the commission on Monday. Elliff is the president, CEO and director of Economic Development at Carthage Chamber of Commerce, according to a news release. McDowell is president and CEO of Lee’s Summit Economic Development Council.Parson, in a statement, repeated his promise that the state would not again issue tax credits until the program is reformed.
“We are confident in the legislature’s ability to develop tax credit reforms that address housing needs, while ensuring greater accountability and an increased return on the investment of taxpayer dollars,” Parson said. “As a member of the Commission, I am committed to considering current federal tax credit applications, but until substantial reforms are enacted, state tax credits will not be issued.” Parson was able to make the appointments after the state Senate rejected three of Greitens' nominees to the panel earlier this year.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Missouri's new Gov. Mike Parson charges attorney $3,618 for records on ex-Gov. Eric Greitens","Sep 24, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-s-new-gov-mike-parson-charges-attorney-for-records/article_16f09140-0db0-5105-8331-816474a84974.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • St. Louis attorney Elad Gross shot off a 54-point open records request to Gov. Mike Parson's administration on Aug. 18 seeking documents that could offer clues into the dark money mysteries of Parson's predecessor, Eric Greitens.Last week, Gross received the bill: $3,618.40.""We have found 13,659 records that may be responsive to your request,"" Parson's general counsel, Christopher Limbaugh, wrote to Gross. ""Before we begin preparing the information, please forward to this office a check in that amount.""

Gross was a former assistant attorney general under former Attorney General Chris Koster, a Democrat, and has been described by Greitens' campaign attorney as a ""Democratic operative."" Parson, who like Greitens is a Republican, took office on June 1 when Greitens resigned after months of scandal.On Monday morning, Gross wrote a letter back to Parson's office. 















        
            Post-Dispatch coverage of Greitens, his campaign and The Mission Continues

Greitens, a former Navy Seal, founded The Mission Continues in 2007. His alleged use of a fundraising list from the charity is under investigation. 




""Instead of providing those documents you already identified, you attached an invoice for $3,618.40,"" Gross wrote. ""You also stated it would take at least 120 business days after receipt of the money to produce the records — which comes out to more than half a year.""In Gross' request, he asked that the governor's office waive any fees. The Sunshine Law, Gross wrote, says that fees may be reduced or waived if ""that waiver or reduction of the fee is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the public governmental body.""Gross continued:""I hope that the Governor agrees that law enforcement, consumer protection, campaign finance laws, government transparency, the potential need for legislative reform, and rooting out corruption are all in the public interest.""I ask you and the Office of the Governor to reconsider the imposition of fees for my Sunshine Requests,"" he wrote. ""The Sunshine Law was intended to make Missouri’s government more transparent and responsive to Missourians, not to discourage the public’s engagement with their government. That is why the fee-waiver provision is included.""The invoice Gross provided the Post-Dispatch from the governor's office describes an anticipated 90.46 hours of work at a rate of $40 per hour.
It was unclear Monday if the $40-per-hour rate is standard within the governor's office. The Post-Dispatch reviewed old invoices it had received from Greitens' administration when the newspaper sent the office unrelated records requests.Greitens' office waived processing fees when research time was minimal, but also sent invoices with a $19-per-hour rate for larger requests. It was initially unclear Monday whether the governor's office gives journalists — who disseminate information to the public — a reduced rate.Without addressing the cost discrepancy, Kelli Jones, spokeswoman for Parson, said in an email: ""Our office treats all sunshine requests seriously and works diligently to ensure transparency. Every effort is made to accommodate all requests, keep costs reasonable, and provide timely responses.""We routinely receive large requests, some containing tens of thousands of documents, which requires a significant amount of time and office resources to review and complete. We will continue abiding by Missouri law when responding and processing sunshine requests.""
Gross also said he filed a complaint with the office of Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley. He said that his request was made in the public interest, that the Parson administration had already identified more than 13,000 documents possibly responsive to Gross, that the office ""may be charging excessive fees,"" and that the six-month processing time was unreasonable.""I am considering how best to proceed, so please let me know whether you intend to act on this matter,"" Gross wrote to Hawley, a Republican running for U.S. Senate.Gross has said that Hawley should be the person investigating the dark money activities of Greitens. In June, Gross sued Greitens' campaign and a dark-money group allied with the governor, A New Missouri, in order to obtain records from the two groups.A court hearing in that case is scheduled for Oct. 4 in Cole County Circuit Court.""I have no commercial interest in the material requested,"" Gross wrote to Parson's office. ""In fact, the opposite is true. I have spent significant time and resources investigating corruption in our state’s government, a function that should be completed by Missouri’s Attorney General under Missouri’s consumer protection laws.""Hawley has declined to investigate A New Missouri even though he has jurisdiction to investigate non-profits under state law. He has said that he has no jurisdiction because the non-profit was operated as a campaign account, not a charity.Hawley has said that the Missouri Ethics Commission is investigating Greitens.A spokeswoman with Hawley's office said Monday morning the office had not received Gross' complaint, and thus did not yet have a comment.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Gov. Parson names Silvey new chairman of Public Service Commission,"Sep 23, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/business/local/gov-parson-names-silvey-new-chairman-of-public-service-commission/article_9490b8e1-08e9-5870-a605-a48698b4c663.html,"Gov. Mike Parson has appointed Ryan Silvey as the new chairman of the Missouri Public Service Commission — the agency that regulates utilities and other monopolistic businesses in the state.The move went into effect Monday, Silvey told the Post-Dispatch. He and former Chairman Daniel Hall were notified of the governor’s decision late the previous week, and Silvey performed his new role by leading discussion at Wednesday’s PSC meeting.Hall, meanwhile, remains on the five-person commission. Silvey said he hopes that under his watch, the commission will continue to enjoy the bipartisan conduct that it saw under Hall.

“I look forward to having a harmonious commission,” Silvey said. “Chairman Hall did a great job of trying to build consensus within the commission. The commission in my short time has not been acting in a partisan fashion at all. Most decisions have been 5-0.”Silvey, a Kansas City Republican and a former state senator, was appointed to the commission in January by then-Gov. Eric Greitens. Despite being the PSC’s newest commissioner, Silvey said there is “quite a bit of precedent” of newcomers to the commission getting elevated to chairman within their first year of service or sometimes right away.
Commissioners are confirmed by the Missouri Senate and serve six-year terms. Terms of two members — Hall and Bill Kenney — are set to expire next year, with commissioner Scott Rupp’s tenure winding down by April 2020.
A spokesman for the governor’s office said Silvey’s appointment provides an opportunity for “stability and continuity long-term.”Silvey said the chairman position is not bound by term limits and can typically shift when governors of different political parties take office. While the four other commissioners were all chosen by former Gov. Jay Nixon, a Democrat, those appointments included Republicans such as Rupp and Kenney.As a state senator, Silvey dealt with utility issues as chairman of the Committee on Commerce, Consumer Protection, Energy and the Environment. He also sponsored legislation pushed by utilities, including Ameren, that sought to overhaul the way electricity rates are structured in the state.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri education board launches search for top official,"Sep 19, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/education/missouri-education-board-launches-search-for-top-official/article_49447db0-d9cb-5085-a501-0af690b56902.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • The search for Missouri's next top education official has begun.The State Board of Education is accepting applications for the next education commissioner beginning Wednesday. The deadline to apply is 4:30 p.m. Oct. 19.

The board fired former commissioner Margie Vandeven last year. That came after former Gov. Eric Greitens stacked the board with his appointees, who led her push out. Greitens wanted Vandeven replaced.
But efforts to replace her were delayed following pushback from state senators, who balked at Vandeven's firing and did not confirm Greitens' appointees. Greitens has since resigned in scandal, and new Gov. Mike Parson replaced his appointees with people who faced considerably less pushback.
The revamped board now is restarting its search for the next elementary and secondary education leader."
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Ten West Nile virus cases around St. Louis, but not if you ask the state","Sep 19, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/ten-west-nile-virus-cases-around-st-louis-but-not/article_2129ccf5-f19b-5521-b431-130a0ad9efd5.html,"All 10 cases of West Nile virus diagnosed this year in Missouri have been in the St. Louis area, including one death.That geographic detail is no longer available on the Missouri health department website, where cases of the mosquito-borne virus were provided by county from 2002 to 2017 but are now the state’s latest example of withholding information by citing privacy concerns.The department will decide what information to release on a case-by-case basis, according to state health officials.

Department spokeswoman Megan Hopkins confirmed U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data showing that all West Nile virus cases in 2018 have been in St. Louis County or St. Louis. A records request from the state for county-level West Nile virus data is pending.A hypothetical case of West Nile virus in Worth County, population 2,200, might not be revealed because of federal privacy laws, said department director Dr. Randall Williams, who was appointed to the position in 2017 by former Gov. Eric Greitens.“We think that we have to approach each case, each decision about releasing data on its own merits,” Williams said. “To the degree that we can without violating HIPAA (federal privacy law), we will report West Nile virus by county.”According to the Missouri health department’s HIPAA brochure, communicable disease information “can be released only in aggregate form that prevents the identification of a patient or physician.”Missouri reports other communicable diseases by county, including HIV, tuberculosis and lead poisoning. For example, there is one person living with HIV in Worth County, according to the state.It is important for people to know which communicable diseases are circulating in their area to try to prevent infection. The need is especially great in smaller counties such as Worth that don’t have health departments or prevention efforts such as mosquito surveillance and spraying, public health experts said.
The CDC reports West Nile cases by county except for Maryland, South Carolina and Virginia, which provide that information on state websites. At least 34 other states where the disease circulates, including Kansas and Illinois, also provide county-by-county counts of the disease on their websites.Montana reports three cases of West Nile virus in McCone County, population 1,700. In North Dakota’s LaMoure County, there are two cases in a population of 4,100.In Delaware, the health department has released information in the last month about West Nile virus cases in a 73-year-old New Castle County man, a 60-year-old Sussex County man and a 68-year-old New Castle County man, a whooping cough outbreak in 97 people in an Amish community in Kent County, the death from rabies of a Kent County woman and flu illnesses in a 50-year-old woman from Sussex County and a 70-year-old woman from New Castle County.
“The more local you can make it, the more likely people are to pay attention,” said Andrea Wojcik, the state health department’s chief of community relations. “It’s a tricky balance sometimes to provide people with prevention tips (while) respecting that personal privacy requirement.”Wojcik said she could not imagine a scenario where Delaware would not release the county numbers for any reportable infectious disease, including Ebola or anthrax.Williams’ secrecy with Missouri health data has previously stirred up concerns in the state Legislature. Earlier this year, the Legislature cut eight positions in Williams’ office after he refused to release information about testing for the tick-borne Bourbon virus in Meramec State Park, where a state worker caught the disease and died in 2017.Former state Rep. Justin Alferman, who now works in Gov. Mike Parson’s administration, previously said Williams used a “weird interpretation of HIPAA” to deny the release of aggregate test results.St. Louis County last month sent a news release announcing the county’s first West Nile virus case of the season. County health director Faisal Khan, who is departing the job, said it is not unheard of for a state to hold back the same information but in Missouri’s case he “(hasn’t) seen an adequate explanation for the rationale behind it.”

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri governor mulls changes in child support punishment to address driver shortage,"Sep 19, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-governor-mulls-changes-in-child-support-punishment-to-address/article_652263be-5876-547d-9a0b-213112d8fb87.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Gov. Mike Parson is considering changing a key way Missouri enforces the payment of child support in an attempt to address a nationwide shortage of truck drivers.Under state law, a person who hasn’t paid child support for three months can lose a driver’s license or other occupational licenses.But, with the trucking industry scrambling to fill driver jobs, Parson told the Post-Dispatch its time to look at alternatives.

“Today, we are tremendously short on drivers,” Parson said. “Let’s find another way to serve up that punishment.”The proposal is part of Parson’s attempts to improve the state’s workforce, while also attacking a shortage that could raise the cost of consumer products in the coming years. The American Trucking Association projects a shortage of 100,000 drivers by 2021.The shortage has triggered legislative attempts to lower the legal age to become a long-haul trucker to 18, down from 21, prompting safety questions from some industry experts.Parson did not outline what might replace the loss of a driver’s license as a way to punish child support scofflaws, but said it is something he will look into heading into the 2019 legislative session.“For a nondriving offense, that’s not practical,” said Parson, who took over as governor on June 1.
In 2017, more than 7,000 Missouri drivers lost their licenses for failing to pay child support, compared to 8,080 in 2016, according to figures provided by the Missouri Department of Revenue.In addition to the proposed changes to child support, Parson also said he’d like to give state prison inmates “real world” experience in learning how to drive trucks so they are more prepared to fill the driver shortage when they leave prison.
Parson told the newspaper he would like to free up Missouri Department of Transportation trucks to supplement current programs where inmates use simulators to learn about long-haul trucking.“That’s another avenue to workforce development,” Parson said.The state currently has commercial vehicle operator programs in Farmington and Bowling Green. There also is a heavy equipment operator training program in Boonville.“There is a tremendous shortage of skilled labor in the construction industry right now, and employers are thrilled to find people who have been properly trained and certified — and are very eager to work — to do these jobs,” said Missouri Department of Corrections spokeswoman Karen Pojmann.Pojmann said six inmates who graduated from the heavy equipment training job landed jobs with Missouri employers before being released.A number of other states have similar truck driver training programs for prison inmates, including North Carolina, which is where Corrections Director Anne Precythe was a prison system administrator before taking her post in Missouri in 2017.

CHARLES/LINCOLN COUNTIES • Tony Lovasco, who lost a St. Charles County Council race in the Aug. 7 Republican primary, has been tapped by GOP leaders to run for a newly vacant Missouri House seat.Lovasco, who lives near O'Fallon, was chosen Saturday by a party selection committee as the new nominee for the seat formerly held by Rep. Robert Cornejo, R-St. Peters.

Cornejo announced his resignation later in August to accept appointment by Gov. Mike Parson as chairman of the state Labor and Industrial Relations Commission.Lovasco, 34, a sales consultant, will face Democratic nominee Shawn Finklein, 37, a union electrician who lives in an unincorporated area of Lincoln County, in the Nov. 6 election.  He was picked earlier this month.

Although Cornejo had been running unopposed for re-election, state law allowed Democratic party leaders to choose a nominee for the seat after he withdrew his candidacy.The House district, the 64th, takes in parts of St. Charles and Lincoln counties.Lovasco lost to County Councilman Joe Cronin of St. Paul in the August primary."
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri school officials put finishing touches on next year's budget plan,"Sep 18, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/education/missouri-school-officials-put-finishing-touches-on-next-year-s/article_fcaca18a-10ab-5224-827a-b7c818f7a6b0.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Buoyed by encouragement from Gov. Mike Parson, state education officials are asking Missouri lawmakers to earmark $140 million more for schools next year.In a meeting Tuesday, the state Board of Education unanimously endorsed a proposed $6.3 billion budget that attempts to ramp up funding for school transportation costs, which are only being funded at about 17 percent of the total need.Jennifer Jordan, chief budget officer for the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, said the agency is asking for more money over a five-year span to get to 75 percent of busing costs.

“Transportation is short of full funding by $198 million,” Jordan told the board.About $77 million of the proposed increase would go toward fully funding the foundation formula, which sets out how much each school district will receive in the next fiscal year.In May, lawmakers approved a budget that included $3.49 billion for the formula. But, the base level of state funding is going up to $6,370 per student, resulting in the request for more money.Despite the proposed increase, board member Mike Jones bemoaned the shortfall in transportation funding.""There's no way for the public to understand how under-resourced K-12 education is in Missouri,” Jones said.But, board president Charlie Shields said the Parson administration has encouraged the agency to tell lawmakers what is actually needed to fund schools, rather than tailoring their requests for money to a limited amount of dollars.“What’s being presented is radically different from what we’ve been doing in previous years,” Shields said. “This is what we think the priorities are.”Shields also said he expects the Legislature to have a “robust” discussion on increasing funding for early childhood education programs.
“I think it’s a high priority for the governor,” Shields said.The request now heads to Parson’s budget office, where it will be combined with other proposed state spending. Parson, the former lieutenant governor, is crafting his first budget blueprint after taking over for scandal-plagued former Gov. Eric Greitens, who resigned June 1.This year, the budget that went into effect in July gave schools a nearly $99 million increase, allowing lawmakers to claim the state is meeting its core school funding goals outlined in state law. It also boosted state aid for school transportation costs by $10 million.
The board also approved a plan for hiring the next commissioner of education. Roger Dorson has been serving as the interim head since Margie Vandeven was terminated on December 1 after Greitens had stacked the board with his own appointees.Shields said the process would be similar to the last two searches for commissioners. The job will be posted this week and stay open for a month. A small committee of the board would then narrow down the applicants with an eye on making an offer in November.Shields said Dorson might be considered for the top post.“We have a very high functioning interim commissioner in Roger Dorson,” Shields said.The board attempted to launch a hiring plan after Vandeven was ousted, but the ongoing wrangling over Greitens’ intervention on the board may have tamped down interest in the high-profile post.The board received just 10 applications for the job before the process was halted.That compared to more than 40 applications for a similar job opening in Ohio and more than 50 in Michigan."
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Missouri lawmakers approve education, drug treatment court bills as they finish special session","Sep 14, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-lawmakers-approve-education-drug-treatment-court-bills-as-they/article_25e318b8-948f-551b-816c-5db1bd752ba2.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Missouri legislators wrapped up a week-long special session on Friday, sending two pieces of legislation — one dealing with computer science education, the other dealing with drug treatment courts — to Gov. Mike Parson.This week was the first in which Parson, a Republican who took office in June after the resignation of Gov. Eric Greitens, presided over state government while lawmakers considered legislation.Parson vetoed two bills dealing with computer science and treatment courts over the summer. Rather than risk lawmakers overriding his vetoes, he called a special session so that lawmakers could start from scratch.

The Senate voted 28-1 to send Parson legislation designed to encourage computer science education in public schools. The measure allows high school students to substitute a math, science or practical arts credit needed for graduation with a computer science credit.Skeptics worried the legislation would steer students away from basic math and science courses in favor of computer science.“Math is, unfortunately, the course that so many students get into high school and try to avoid,” said Sen. Jill Schupp, a Creve Coeur Democrat who was the lone “no” vote in the Senate.Proponents countered that students interested in computer science also tend to be interested in math and science. They say encouraging classes such as coding is an economic development tool.Parents and guardians will be required to sign a form acknowledging that substituting a math or science class for a computer science class could adversely affect college admission decisions.The legislation also allows the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education to select a nonprofit that could solicit proposals from companies — the objective being for the company to help launch a science, technology, engineering and mathematics — or STEM — career awareness program in the state.Schupp said that giving a nonprofit the ability to choose a company opens the potential for corruption.If “a nonprofit was chosen by DESE with all good intentions, and the nonprofit receives a donation from a vendor that then wins the contract to provide the — to become the provider — I don’t know how we know about that,” Schupp said during floor debate on Friday.Drug court bill
Lawmakers also sent to Parson a measure designed to encourage the expansion of drug treatment courts in the state.The Senate gave final approval to the plan on Friday, which would place all of the state’s treatment courts under one regulatory umbrella. It also adds two more members — one representing prosecutors and one representing the criminal defense bar — to the state commission that oversees drug courts.The term “drug courts” would be replaced with “treatment courts” in state statute.Under the bill, the state commission would be authorized to establish best practice standards for treatment courts. The legislation would make it easier to authorize venue changes for offenders.
In other action on Friday, Sen. Jamilah Nasheed, D-St. Louis, held up traffic in the upper chamber in an effort to torpedo the nomination of Peter Herschend to the state Board of Education.Herschend, of Branson, previously served on the board from 1991 to 2017, according to a news release. Nasheed called the state’s education system “deplorable” and said someone else should be nominated.“When it comes to education, he’s been there for approximately 26 years,” Nasheed said. “The educational system is deplorable right now.”Nasheed was ultimately successful, as Parson withdrew Herschend’s nomination from consideration.Parson this week was able to ensure his budget decisions remained in tact. While the House overrode four line-item budget vetoes Wednesday, totaling about $785,000, the Senate balked at crossing the new governor.Also this week, Sen. Lauren Arthur, D-Kansas City, was sworn in. In June, the then-state representative won a special election to represent the 17th Senate District, a seat previously held by a Republican.Going into the November elections, Republicans still command two-thirds majorities in both the state House and Senate. Democrats are attempting to trim that advantage.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Messenger: Missouri once invested in its future by protecting its past: A lesson from Leopold Cabin.,"Sep 13, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/columns/tony-messenger/messenger-missouri-once-invested-in-its-future-by-protecting-its/article_8c75b728-8c80-551d-91bd-31ac39a470f5.html,"I was alone in Caney Mountain Conservation Area.At least, that’s how it felt.Driving into the 7,900-acre nature and wildlife preserve in Ozark County last week, the conservation agent passed me going the other way in his truck.

He waved. Everybody in Ozark County waves.For two hours I hiked along Caney Creek, past Leopold Cabin, up near High Rock and never saw a soul. I was overcome not with loneliness but a feeling of community, the thought that everybody in Missouri, every taxpayer, every conservation advocate, everybody who saw something here worth preserving, created this moment of solitude and peacefulness, just for me.To some degree, they did.In 1937, Missouri voters created the first politically independent conservation department in the country. After the Missouri Legislature had failed for decades to listen to sportsmen and do something to protect fish and wildlife for the next generation, environmentalists and hunters got together and took matters into their own hands.At the time, Missouri’s once — and now again — vibrant wild turkey population had dwindled to next to nothing. In 1940, Starker Leopold, the son of famed conservationist Aldo Leopold, identified Caney Mountain as key to the solution. Working with the new independent conservation department — which was to be driven by science instead of politics — Leopold nurtured a dozen or so wild turkeys in the now preserved area into enough of a population to once again, decades later, allow wild turkey hunting in the state.I’ve never hunted a wild turkey in my life — though I’ve enjoyed some harvested by my wife’s family. The Morrisons have deep roots in this area, some of them having lived on the land in and around Caney Mountain. They are farmers and hunters. When they get together for family reunions, I’m often the odd man out. I don’t hunt and have never owned a John Deere tractor. Conversations are short.
On my hike, I felt a new family bond.Upon returning to my car and regaining cellphone use, I looked up the nature preserve’s history, and came across this quote from Aldo Leopold, known as the father of modern conservation.“Conservation, at bottom, rests on the conviction that there are things in this world more important than dollar signs and ciphers. Many of these other things attach to the land, and to the life that is on it and in it,” he said at a gathering in 1947, according to the Department of Conservation website.
“People who know these other things have been growing scarcer, but less so in Missouri than elsewhere. That is why conservation is possible here. If conservation can become a living reality, it can do so in Missouri. This is because Missourians, in my opinion, are not completely industrialized in mind and spirit, and I hope never will be.”Leopold, I suspect, would be disappointed in Missourians these days.The Legislature is often at war with the Department of Conservation, seeking to limit the independence that was so important to its founding. A state that created a dedicated tax to help preserve Missouri’s rich fish and wildlife resources has become so tax averse that its roads and other infrastructure are crumbling. After Gov. Jay Nixon sought during his two terms to expand parks in the state, particularly by turning the old Rock Island rail line into a cross state trail to build on the success of the Katy Trail, his efforts were blunted during the brief tenure of Gov. Eric Greitens.My hike in the woods was intended as a respite from politics, and yet, in taking in the splendor around me that was created out of a political reality decades ago, my thoughts turned to the first 100 days of Gov. Mike Parson’s stewardship of the state.Parson, like Nixon before him, seems to believe, as Leopold did, that Missouri is best when it does things for the greater good of its future generations. Perhaps it’s because he’s a farmer, and conservation comes naturally. Parson backs a gasoline tax increase on November’s ballot, because he knows investing in the state’s highways is an absolute necessity. He called a special session to pass an initiative that should improve math and science education in the state and make Missouri’s future workforce more enticing to employers. These are hopeful signs for a state that once was a national leader in thinking big thoughts that put future generations ahead of short-term political gains.I left Caney Mountain hopeful. A quiet walk alone amid Missouri’s bounty can do that.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri Senate balks at overriding Gov. Mike Parson's budget vetoes,"Sep 12, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-senate-balks-at-overriding-gov-mike-parson-s-budget/article_3cb99803-27f9-598b-b320-7860b725791f.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Missouri’s new governor passed his first significant political test Wednesday by blocking efforts to override a series of budget vetoes he made in June.Although the Missouri House voted to override a handful of Gov. Mike Parson’s line-item vetoes to the state’s $28 billion budget, the former senator managed to keep the Republican allies in the upper chamber in line.None of the four budget vetoes, worth a total of $785,000, were brought up for an override vote before lawmakers adjourned Wednesday.

Lawmakers had returned to the Capitol for their annual veto session. The overrides put the Republican-led House at odds with Parson, a Republican who took office in June after scandal-plagued Gov. Eric Greitens resigned.The four vetoed budget items that the House voted to override were:• $45,000 that was destined for the Missouri Commission for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing.• $153,000 to the state’s Time Critical Diagnosis Unit, which helps direct critically injured patients to hospitals that can best treat them.• $487,000 that was destined for the state’s public defender office. It was intended for juvenile advocates within the office.• $100,000 to the state’s Office of Child Advocate.“We are making sure we are taking care of kids in the foster care system,” said Rep. Kurt Bahr, R-O’Fallon.Sen. Dan Brown, R-Rolla, said the governor’s office has assured him the programs can be funded in other ways, whether by reallocating funds or approving additional money when the Legislature returns next year.“They’ve assured me that this money will show up in the supplemental budget,” Brown said.
Lawmakers on Wednesday also continued a special session designed to fix two proposed laws that Parson vetoed dealing with drug treatment courts and education in science, technology and math.The House advanced a plan that would place all of the state’s treatment courts under one regulatory umbrella. It also adds two more members — one representing prosecutors and one representing the criminal defense bar — to the state commission that oversees drug courts.The term “drug courts” would be replaced with “treatment courts” in state statute.Under the bill, the state commission would be authorized to establish best practice standards for treatment courts. The legislation would make it easier to authorize venue changes for offenders.
The House also endorsed legislation requiring the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education to establish an online program to increase awareness of computer careers among middle school students.DESE would also develop a high school graduation policy that allows students to take a computer science course for one unit of math, science or practical arts credit.“What it seems to me is that we are pitting computer science against math,” said Rep. Tommie Pierson Jr., D-St. Louis. “And we’re pitting computer science against science.”Rep. Travis Fitzwater, R-Holts Summit, the sponsor of the bill, said those concerns were overblown.He said guidance counselors would be required to notify students and parents that the lack of a particular science or math credit could jeopardize admittance into some colleges and universities. He said students interested in computer science also tend to be interested in math and science.“A lot of the kids that are interested in this, they realize they will need an education in math and science,” Fitzwater said. “On top of that, there’s math and science in these classes.”The Senate is expected to take up the two pieces of legislation on Thursday.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Governor's callous action hurts neighbors of radioactive landfill,"Sep 11, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/columnists/governor-s-callous-action-hurts-neighbors-of-radioactive-landfill/article_07af9a28-0dda-5670-996d-1a18e5b8b1f9.html,"Throughout my nearly 20 years in public service, no issue has affected me more personally than the lasting damage to my constituents from radioactive waste migration, storage and dumping. The radiation waste that sits just beneath the surface at the West Lake Landfill is no exception.I have held 100 town hall meetings and conducted over 1,000 interviews with St. Louis County residents regarding their experience with radioactive waste. I have personally witnessed the incredible pain and suffering that this toxic waste has brought on so many lives.For those who may not be aware, a little history. In 1942, a St. Louis company began processing vast amounts of uranium as part of the Manhattan Project. Over the next 25 years, the company’s uranium processing created enormous amounts of radioactive waste, which was secretly discarded at sites throughout the St. Louis area, including West Lake.

Today, West Lake’s radioactive waste sits on the outskirts of a former quarry with practically none of the standard safety features found in most municipal landfills. The dangerous materials dumped in this area will continue to pose a hazard for hundreds of thousands of years. A few feet south of this radioactive site, an underground fire is constantly burning at the Bridgeton Landfill. This ongoing public health disaster is a prime suspect behind the deaths of scores of residents through cancer, stillbirths and other diseases.As an elected leader who represents the area around the West Lake and the Bridgeton landfills, I cannot heal those inflicted with cancer. I cannot bring back those lives tragically cut short. One thing I can do is fight for better policies and more funding for those affected.This year, I secured a $1 million appropriation in the state budget to begin a home buyout program for owners of homes near the toxic waste. Through my line item, the state was poised to take a definitive step to begin addressing the crisis at West Lake Landfill.Unfortunately, Gov. Mike Parson stopped this progress and canceled the funding, leaving hundreds of families languishing in the path of death and disease. His excuse for doing so is Attorney General Josh Hawley’s latest example of selling out the people of Missouri.
As you will recall, in June, Gov. Parson stumbled into the state’s highest office by succeeding the scandal-prone Eric Greitens. Only days after he assumed office, Gov. Parson vetoed the entire $1 million for the Contaminated Home-Acquisition Program. In explaining his veto, his office said: “Recent actions in an agreement with the attorney general’s office and owners of the Bridgeton Landfill ensure that remediation and cleanup efforts will occur, leaving this appropriation unnecessary.”Hidden in the governor’s lie is the fact that the settlement engineered by Attorney General Hawley’s office forbids money to pay residents or fund home buyout programs. Hawley did secure a $1 million civil penalty for his own office. Think about that: The people living near the radioactive waste won’t see their $1 million, but Josh Hawley’s office will.Meanwhile, Gov. Parson’s administration also gets a payout with $2 million going to his Department of Natural Resources for staff time and other expenses.
Even the $12.5 million included in the settlement for “nonprofit entities surrounding the landfill” does nothing to assist those people who own radioactive homes. Not only is the settlement devoid of language requiring or authorizing a home buyout program, but the settlement itself (on page 8, schedule B of Exhibit 1) contains language expressly forbidding money in the fund to pay individuals directly for a buyout program.While it is an outrage that Gov. Parson used Hawley’s weak settlement to justify vetoing money to help Missouri residents escape their radioactive homes, in retrospect, it should be no surprise that Gov. Parson acted so callously.This is the same man who put money in the state budget to pay for a private Capitol valet service. The same man who tried to get even more state money so he could hire a personal driver. The same man who now lives in a taxpayer-funded mansion because of a toxic politician, while real Missourians are trapped in their homes because of toxic pollution.The fire at Bridgeton Landfill is now burning on Gov. Parson’s watch. It’s time he stops ignoring the heat."
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Missouri lawmakers focus on drug courts, education as special session heats up","Sep 11, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-lawmakers-focus-on-drug-courts-education-as-special-session/article_fcd31483-e150-5543-a5a4-a77d5406ac75.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Missouri lawmakers returned to the Capitol on Tuesday to consider legislation dealing with drug treatment courts and education in science, technology and math.The Missouri House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday unanimously advanced legislation that would bolster Missouri’s drug treatment courts. The House Workforce Development Committee approved legislation allowing computer science courses to count toward math, science or practical art credits needed for high school graduation.The moves came after Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican, vetoed two bills addressing the topics over the summer. Rather than override the new governor, lawmakers are attempting to rework the proposals after Parson called for a special session last month.

The legislation dealing with drug treatment courts, House Bill 2, would place all of the state’s treatment courts under one regulatory umbrella. It also adds two more members — one representing prosecutors and one representing the criminal defense bar — to the state commission that oversees drug courts. The term “drug courts” would be replaced with “treatment courts” in state statute.Under the bill, the state commission would be authorized to establish best practice standards for the state’s treatment courts. The legislation would make it easier to authorize venue changes for offenders.Jackson County launched the first so-called treatment court in Missouri in 1993, according to the state Drug Courts Coordinating Commission. The commission says that Missouri has more treatment courts per capita than any state in the nation.According to the commission, the courts have diverted drug users from incarceration. Participants have lower recidivism rates compared to offenders who are put on probation or who enter prison. The courts have also reduced “crime and the need for foster care,” according to the commission.Treatment court participants gave birth to 925 babies between 1993 and 2017; 846 of those babies were born “drug-free,” according to the commission. More recent state figures put the number of drug-free babies born at 871.According to the commission, the state has saved “millions of dollars in lifetime costs in care for children” because of the proliferation of drug courts in Missouri.
At the end of last year, there were 147 treatment court programs in Missouri, including various adult treatment courts, juvenile treatment courts, family treatment courts, DWI treatment courts and veterans courts.The House was also moving to fix on Tuesday legislation that attempts to boost the number of students pursuing careers in computer science.Under legislation approved unanimously by the House Workforce Development Committee, the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education will establish an online-based program to increase awareness of computer careers among middle school students.
St. Louis School Guide: Get test scores and moreDESE would also develop a high school graduation policy that allows students to take a computer science course for one unit of math, science or practical arts credit.Business groups praised the proposal, which is a focal point of Parson’s agenda.“This was the No. 1 issue that our members cared about,” said Ryan Stauffer of the Missouri Chamber of Commerce and Industry.“We believe in a strong workforce and employ a lot of these computer programmers, so we support this,” added Kyna Iman, who represents Boeing Co.But, there also are concerns that it could mean fewer math classes for students. Scott Penman of the Missouri Association of School Counselors said students will have to pay extra to take make-up math courses in college.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Few fireworks as Missouri's Republican-controlled Legislature returns to action,"Sep 11, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/few-fireworks-as-missouri-s-republican-controlled-legislature-returns-to/article_4e631a2d-5078-5330-b45c-1cfff78aea4b.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • There were few fireworks when Missouri lawmakers convened a special legislative session on Monday.Facing a call by Gov. Mike Parson to fix two proposed laws that he vetoed this year, the Republican-controlled House and Senate spent the day positioning legislation for a vote later in the week.Parson, a Republican, ordered the session late last month to run concurrently with the Legislature’s annual veto session, which is set for Wednesday.

Rather than override the new governor, who marked his 100th day in office on Sunday, lawmakers will attempt to rework the two bills.One would allow high school computer science courses to count toward math, science or practical art credits needed for graduation. Parson vetoed the measure, saying it unfairly appeared to be tailored to apply to one contractor.Rep. Travis Fitzwater, R-Holts Summit, told KCUR in July that Learning Blade, which works with Arkansas, Kentucky and Tennessee public schools on STEM curriculum, helped write the language of the legislation.At the time, however, Fitzwater added the Chattanooga, Tenn.-based company wouldn’t be the only software firm that could meet the criteria.“I don’t believe that there was any sort of malfeasance or anything with this bill,” said Sen. John Rizzo, D-Independence. “This is just an honest mistake.”Sen. Jamilah Nasheed, D-St. Louis, wondered why lawmakers couldn’t reconsider the legislation when they came back for their regular session in January.“Why are we in special session when we could have dealt with this in January?” she asked the bill sponsor, Sen. Doug Libla, R-Poplar Bluff, wondering how much money the special session would cost.If all the state’s legislators collected their daily expense checks, the special session could cost an estimated $20,000 per day, not including staffing and mileage reimbursement costs.“We need to get this moving,” Libla said, adding that the state is losing out on investment opportunities. The senator said changes he is proposing in the legislation will eliminate concerns that it was drafted to benefit one vendor.
The other proposal dealt with treatment courts. Parson said the bill appeared to violate constitutional prohibitions on including multiple subjects under one bill.“These two issues were a part of the General Assembly’s historic session as they passed a number of their priorities,” Parson said in a statement. “By working together to come up with a more narrowly defined focus, we will have better served the people of Missouri.”The sponsor of the drug treatment legislation, Rep. Kevin Austin, R-Springfield, said he expects the measure to move quickly out of the House.“You never take anything for granted, but this should be an easy walk for me,” Austin said.
Also on tap are votes later in the week on appointments he’s made to various boards and commissions, including the state Board of Education, which has only begun meeting again after the Legislature rejected appointments made by former Gov. Eric Greitens.Although a special session is designed to fix legislation without having to override the governor, he could face backlash over his line-item veto of about $12 million out of the state’s $28 billion budget.Among the items that could be overridden is a $153,000 cut that Parson made from the Department of Health and Senior Services. The program designates hospitals as stroke, heart attack and trauma centers.Parson also received bipartisan scorn for cutting $50,000 to supply local law enforcement officers with tourniquets designed to stop bleeding if police or the public are injured.In an interview Saturday, Parson told the Post-Dispatch he believes supplying the tourniquets should be a local decision.“At what point do we say, how much are we going to supply. I think if the people of the towns and the counties felt like that need was there, they would do it,” Parson said.Senate President Pro Tem Ron Richard, R-Joplin, said “no” when asked if the upper chamber would attempt to override any of Parson’s budget decisions.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"On a drizzly Saturday in Bolivar, Missouri's new governor marks 100 days in office","Sep 10, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/on-a-drizzly-saturday-in-bolivar-missouri-s-new-governor/article_1e4619c3-02c7-5539-aadc-878a97692c80.html,"BOLIVAR • Dressed in socks, a John Deere sweatshirt and blue jeans, Missouri Gov. Mike Parson gazed out of a window of his rural Polk County home Saturday.

Pointing to two flag poles in the rain-soaked backyard, the 62-year-old Republican said he dug the holes and set them in concrete the previous weekend while he was on a break from his duties as chief executive in the Capitol City.

And that was in between tending to a herd of about 100 cattle spread across the pasture surrounding his house.“It’s a good getaway for me. It’s good therapy. I can get out here and be alone,” Parson told the Post-Dispatch in a wide-ranging interview at his home.Parson, who marked his 100th day in office Sunday, said the transition from lieutenant governor to the state’s top elected office after the stunning resignation of scandal-plagued former Gov. Eric Greitens has been a whirlwind.“Man, you give up a lot on the family side. That’s just the reality of it,” said Parson, who was sworn in June 1. “It’s a change in your lifestyle. We’re just now starting to get a rhythm.”Asked what he’s found most surprising about his new job, Parson said, “I think the demands of the job. The serious nature of the job.”“You’re now the guy whose job is to get it right,” he said.

Photos: First 100 days of Governor Mike ParsonParson, who turns 63 next week, said he was moving his cattle when the phone call came announcing that Greitens was on his way out. Although the potential of him ascending to the top spot had been percolating for months as Greitens faced the possibility of a criminal conviction or impeachment, the moment still came as a shock.He and his wife, Teresa, had just moved into their new house. There were still things to be done to make it a home, like erecting the flag poles.“We lived here about 30 days and we got the call to go to Jefferson City,” Parson said.Starting conversationsParson was near one of his barns, surrounded by cows, when he learned Greitens had pulled the plug after 17 tumultuous months in office. Parson turned down an offer to be picked up by the governor’s security detail. That, he said, would give him and his wife time to discuss the transition on the two-hour car ride to Jefferson City.From there, he has set about trying to reverse the often combative, confrontational course set by his predecessor. He removed the electronic lock that the notoriously media-averse Greitens had installed on the door to the governor’s press office. Now, on most days, the door is open to the public.“I really want to make an effort to be transparent. I really want to do that,” he said.Parson also has held numerous meetings with mayors, county officials and lawmakers, many of whom had felt largely shut out of the decision-making process under the former administration. And, he kept most of Greitens’ agency heads on board.In his first 100 days, Parson has spent a lot of time listening. He’s made treks to Kansas City and St. Louis, hoping to bridge the urban and rural divide in Missouri, and he’s promoted the idea of workforce development, a catch-all phrase for making sure young Missourians are ready for the jobs that await them.

“We’ve got a chance of really making Missouri a better place,” Parson said.He’s also gotten solidly behind a proposed gas tax increase, pitching it as a way to improve the state’s highways and create construction industry jobs.
In November, voters will be asked to weigh in on a phased-in 10-cent increase in the state’s 17-cent per gallon motor fuel tax. It would be the first boost since the Legislature approved a 6-cent increase in 1992.“That will change Missouri for the future, dramatically,” Parson said.Rep. Phil Christofanelli, R-St. Peters, is among those who said Greitens’ exodus released pressure that had been building under the Capitol dome since news broke in January that the former governor had an extramarital affair in 2015.“There’s no doubt about it that the early part of this year was a sad and trying time for our state. It was a time when emotions were pretty high,” Christofanelli said. “From that perspective, the fact that that environment has changed has certainly been a relief in my eyes. It was a bad situation, no matter what perspective you were looking at it from.”Christofanelli said Parson’s approach to lawmakers also is different than Greitens.“Parson has been the one to initiate the conversations,” Christofanelli said.Thus far, he’s met with the governor twice, talking tax policy and education.
“It’s given me the opportunity to know him better,” Christofanelli said. “He’s struck me as open-minded. I found that reassuring.”Grappling with the LegislatureWhile the new governor has received high marks for smoothing out what had become a turbulent time in state government, he has rubbed some lawmakers the wrong way.In signing the state’s $28.65 billion state budget, Parson used his line-item veto power to cancel 21 separate provisions totaling more than $12 million.

Among them were a $100,000 to the Child Advocate Office, $50,000 to buy tourniquets for police departments and $153,000 to certify hospitals to treat trauma, stroke and heart attack patients.Cutting money for the tourniquets drew bipartisan scorn. Supporters said they would be used to stop bleeding from injuries sustained by both officers and members of the public.But Parson, a former member of the House and Senate and a former Polk County sheriff, said buying items like tourniquets should be left to local governments to decide. He said if the state begins mandating items like tourniquets, it could lead to other spending requirements on equipment, such as bullet proof vests.Parson also vetoed legislation that dealt with drug treatment courts, saying the measure included multiple subjects, a violation of the Constitution.He also vetoed a proposal aimed at boosting computer science among Missouri’s high school students by allowing high school computer science courses to count toward math, science or practical art credits needed for graduation.On Monday, rather than face override votes by the Legislature when they return to town for their annual veto session, Parson has called them into a special session aimed at fixing the problems with both pieces of legislation.It will be his first real test in grappling with members of the Legislature.“For us, this is the first time all of the legislators are going to be there. All of them have some concerns or something going on that they want to talk about. We’re trying to figure out how the week is going to flow,” Parson said.“Hopefully it will go pretty smoothly. But I’ve been in the Senate so I’m reluctant to say anything is a done deal,” Parson said.

Mike Parson, Kansas City Mayor Sly James and Mayor Lyda Krewson toured St. Louis on Friday, the discussions at each stop often returned to one common goal: strengthening relationships between state officials and the leaders of Missouri’s two largest cities.Parson, a conservative Republican from Bolivar, and Krewson and James, who lead Missouri’s largely Democratic urban centers, don’t often see eye to eye on public policy matters, by their own admission.Touring one another’s cities — together with a third trip in the works for the two mayors to spend time in rural Missouri — reflects a renewed effort to find some common ground, and a change in approach from the more strained relationships forged by Parson’s predecessor, Eric Greitens.

Both Krewson and James made clear the purpose of hosting the new governor in both St. Louis and Kansas City this summer wasn’t to present Parson with a list of demands, but to get to know one another and share information about challenges and successes in their respective municipalities.“Before we can actually start making requests and demands of each other, we have to have built some trust between each other to know that we’re not playing games here,” James said.But, Krewson added, “we showed him some things” that might suggest “things we want.”The first stop on Friday morning was Nathaniel Rivers Place Apartments, a low-income housing community in north St. Louis that city officials said would have been impossible to build without low-income housing tax credits.

Last year, the Missouri Housing Development Commission voted against using state money to match $140 million in federal low-income housing tax credits through a program that has long been a political flashpoint. Then-Lt. Gov. Parson bucked Greitens in criticizing the move, but Parson maintained Friday that reforms to the program should come through the Legislature.Krewson and James also broached the subject of stronger local control on gun policy, arguing that St. Louis and Kansas City should be able to more tightly regulate guns in their respective regions for the sake of public safety. They had shared their views on the earlier Kansas City trip.
Parson still doesn’t take a firm stance on the matter, but he said he’d keep an open mind should a bill be introduced in the Legislature to address it.“I’ve always been a believer in the Second Amendment. ... Do I think there are ways we maybe can do a better job? I’m open,” Parson said during a meeting with Post-Dispatch editorial writers and editors after the tour.“Everybody wants me to answer that question. I don’t know what that legislation would look like. I don’t know how it would affect the cities,” he said. “We don’t want to have high crime rates. Whatever I can do to help these two mayors, I want to try to assist.”Krewson led Parson and James through a packed itinerary that included visits to Roosevelt High School, Ranken Technical College, and MADE, a working space for artists. They were joined by Linda McMahon, administrator of the U.S. Small Business Administration, for stops at the downtown T-Rex Incubator and GeoData IT LLC, a small veteran-owned business on Washington Avenue.Parson also addressed the St. Louis Board of Aldermen during its first meeting following a summer break.“We’re not going to agree on some things. I’m not going to agree on some of the things you do here, you’re not going to agree on some of the things I do,” Parson told the chamber. “But I will tell you this: If we will be open-minded with one another, there will be many, many things we will agree on, that will be the best thing in the world for the state of Missouri. And we should all focus on that.”

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,St. Louis police union requests restraining order to prevent release of blacklisted officers' names,"Sep 5, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/st-louis-police-union-requests-restraining-order-to-prevent-release/article_95638a45-8790-5a45-a04c-d3435163aca0.html,"ST. LOUIS • The city police union filed on Tuesday a request for a temporary restraining order against the circuit attorney’s office and a commander of the police department to block them from releasing the names of officers whose cases prosecutors will no longer pursue.The filing came as Police Chief John Hayden met with Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner to discuss her concerns and the two “agreed that issues concerning a St. Louis City police’s officer’s credibility shall continue to be reviewed on a case-by-case basis,” a statement issued late Tuesday afternoon by Public Safety Director Jimmie Edwards said.“The conversation was candid and respectful, and they are committed to working together to conduct fair investigations and to do justice in the prosecution of anyone accused of a crime,” Edwards said. “Chief Hayden and Circuit Attorney Gardner also agreed to meet regularly to ensure open communication between their offices.”

The moves are the latest chapters in a controversy that began Thursday after the Post-Dispatch reported that Gardner would quit accepting cases from or allow 28 officers to serve as witnesses because of “credibility” issues.Since then, Gardner and Hayden have issued statements that appear to contradict each other. Gardner insists Maj. Michael Sack asked her for the list of officers and thanked her for helping him hold his “guys accountable” in an email.A request made under the Sunshine Law for that correspondence or the names of the officers on the so-called list was rejected Tuesday by Gardner’s office. “Any such record, and records relating to any such list, are closed records,” Assistant Circuit Attorney James A. Michaels said by email.He cited sections of the law that exclude communications because of attorney-client privilege and if they are “legal work product.”Gov. Mike Parson, in town to talk about the special session he’s calling to expand drug treatment programs and raise awareness about job opportunities through STEM education, said he was “deeply concerned” about the situation.“For a prosecutor to do that — you also have victims out there,” said Parson, a former sheriff in Polk County. “Now, are you taking away their rights as victims (as) to whether you’re going to prosecute or what you’re going to do. I think that’s beyond what the scope of her job would be.”Sack and Gardner’s Chief Warrant Officer Chris Hinckley were served with notice Tuesday that the temporary restraining order was requested. The order states that Hinckley and the police department have “declined to explain the reasons for placement upon this list, the criteria considered in determining whether an individual would be placed on this list, and procedures by which an individual could challenge placement on this list.”“Placement on the list does potential harm and damage to the reputation of the petitioner, defamation of his or her character, impedes the ability to perform current employment duties, jeopardizes potential for advancement and promotion and violates the due process rights of the named petitioner. Furthermore, public disclosure of plaintiff’s name puts his safety at risk in the performance of his duties,” according to the document.A judge has yet to rule on whether to grant the order, and a hearing has not yet been scheduled.Hayden has insisted that no one from his department would ask for such a list.Hayden was questioned about the situation with Gardner’s office at the annual St. Louis Police Foundation luncheon, where he was sitting with Mayor Lyda Krewson and former Police Chief Dan Isom.
“I am interested in moving on and I look forward to meeting with the Circuit Attorney’s Office soon and improve the relationship between her office and my agency,” Hayden said. “I believe there is room for us to grow and become more effective and get back to the business of protecting the citizens of St. Louis.”He refused to answer any other questions about the situation, specifically Gardner’s latest assertion that Sack had asked for the list.“I’ve already made my statements regarding that,” he said.In a statement issued Saturday, Hayden denounced the list as “unnecessary overreach.”
“No leaders from our Department asked the Circuit Attorney’s Office to compile an Exclusion list, nor do we have any need for such a list,” Hayden wrote. “I was quite surprised to have received it.”Edwards also refused to answer questions at the luncheon Tuesday, saying only that he hoped to “have a comment by the end of the week.”In addition to filing the temporary restraining order, the police union sent on Tuesday a letter to Hayden demanding that the union be invited to any meetings with Gardner as it is representing “all of the officers whose reputations have been sullied by inclusion on the list.”“I would humbly propose that without the input of the rank-and-file, there will be no moving on from this travesty. Not now. Not ever,” Jeff Roorda, business manager for the St. Louis Police Officers’ Association, wrote in the letter, a copy of which was obtained by the Post-Dispatch.Of Edwards’ statement Tuesday afternoon, Roorda said that it “doesn’t change anything.”“We’ve still got 28 officers who’ve been notified that the circuit attorney won’t take their cases and they haven’t been notified that anything has changed,” he said.“They’re trying to get the genie back in the bottle.”Roorda added that officers on the list had already had their cases refused by Gardner’s office.“So while Chief Hayden and Kim Gardner were having high tea and crumpets, we still have 2.5 percent of the workforce that can’t put bad guys behind bars,” he said.The Associated Press and Joel Currier of the Post-Dispatch contributed to this report.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"For Missouri lawmakers, September's veto session means money time","Sep 3, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/for-missouri-lawmakers-september-s-veto-session-means-money-time/article_8c3327e7-bdb5-5165-83ed-b66c9b7675f6.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • While it remains unclear whether Missouri lawmakers will try to override any of Gov. Mike Parson’s vetoes when they reconvene next week, their annual early autumn return to the capital city likely will be another lucrative one.In a year when all of the seats in the House and half of the seats in the Senate are up for grabs, more than 70 lawmakers have scheduled fundraisers just blocks away from the Capitol during the week of the one-day session, as well as a special session, on Sept. 12.Take Rep. Shamed Dogan, R-Ballwin, for example. He and former Rep. Sheila Solon, who is running for a seat representing the St. Joseph area, are having a joint reception at the offices of their campaign consultant on High Street, the main drag of Jefferson City’s downtown.

Across the street at a restaurant, Rep. Elijah Haahr, a Republican from Springfield who will serve as speaker of the House next year, is being joined by Rep. Dan Houx and Rep. Rocky Miller in a fundraiser.And, around the corner, Republican Justin Brown of Rolla, who is trying to replace his father, Dan, in the Senate, will be hosting a reception at Madison’s Café, a popular Italian eatery just steps from the Governor’s Mansion.In all, between Monday and Wednesday, at least 25 different events are scheduled for lawmakers and candidates for the Legislature to build campaign war chests.It’s not new for the veto session to be a prime time for raising campaign cash. A Post-Dispatch review found a similar number of fundraisers in the days surrounding the 2017 veto session. In 2015, the newspaper counted about 60 lawmakers involved in at least 18 separate fundraising events.Missouri is among about half of the states where fundraising is not banned while the Legislature is in session. The rationale is that, if it looks bad to receive political contributions from the industries and causes whose issues are affected by lawmakers’ political decisions, then it looks even worse to receive those contributions in the capital city while the lawmakers are gathering to discuss some of those very issues.
Other states have more unique prohibitions. In Illinois, for example, no fundraisers are allowed when lawmakers are in session within the border of Sangamon County, which is home to the capital city of Springfield.The annual rite of autumn, which can yield some of the largest one-time hauls of cash for lawmakers, is not being targeted in legislation nor in an ethics referendum on the November ballot.
The referendum sponsored by the group Clean Missouri would bar most gifts from lobbyists, limit campaign contributions and change the way the state draws its legislative districts.“Anything that can be done to keep our legislators focused on who they’re supposed to represent — and limit the influence of lobbyists and big money donors — is worth considering,” Clean Missouri spokesman Benjamin Singer said. “We do believe that legislative candidates soliciting funds at the Capitol and on state property should be illegal, which presumably could include inviting people to fundraisers that will take place off Capitol grounds but during the session.”Dogan, who is facing a challenge from Democrat Charles Triplett, of Ellisville, said raising money in the days surrounding the veto session is different than holding a fundraiser during the regular session that runs from January to May.“Usually, you don’t have a lot of substantive debate going on in the veto session,” Dogan said. “It’s not like we’re doing a veto session based on a big Boeing bill and there are Boeing lobbyists dropping off big checks.”Dogan says he believes the culture of the Capitol has changed in the past decade.“In some cases, lobbyists have prohibited themselves from contributing money to lawmakers during the session,” he said.

Mike Parson announced Thursday that he is calling legislators back to the capital city for a special session on education and expansion of drug treatment courts.Parson said in a release the special session would run concurrently with the GOP-controlled Legislature's annual veto session, during the week of Sept. 10. He vetoed two bills dealing with the topics over the summer.A special session means lawmakers can try to start from scratch to assuage Parson's concerns instead of forcing a potentially contentious vote to override the new governor's vetoes. Parson, a Republican, took over as governor on June 1 when former Gov. Eric Greitens resigned.

















        
            Post-Dispatch coverage of Greitens' affair scandal

From Greitens' initial statement to calls for his resignation, read the Post-Dispatch coverage of the governor's affair scandal. 




""These two issues were a part of the General Assembly’s historic session as they passed a number of their priorities,"" Parson said in a statement. ""By working together to come up with a more narrowly defined focus, we will have better served the people of Missouri.” Parson vetoed House Bill 2562, which dealt with drug treatment courts, on July 13. Parson also vetoed Senate Bill 894, which dealt with science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) programs in the state.
The Senate bill would have allowed high school computer sciences courses to count toward credits needed for graduation. But Parson said bidding criteria for an online program that was spelled out in the bill appeared tailored for one company.Parson said the bill that in part dealt with treatment courts appeared unconstitutional because it included multiple subjects. He also said the legislation appeared to allow a judge who was seated in 2011 to receive state retirement benefits for which only employees who started working for the state before 2011 are eligible.
The benefits for employees who started before 2011 are considered more generous than the newer plan.Another portion of the House bill allowed certain individuals to enter abandoned property to secure it and clean it. But Parson said this could lead to unsafe situations, especially if the property owner did not know the person was improving the property.This Associated Press contributed to this report.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri ag officials offering `fake meat' companies a reprieve on labeling,"Aug 30, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-ag-officials-offering-fake-meat-companies-a-reprieve-on/article_a2d9b6a8-115e-5abd-874a-45f3f4b26133.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Gov. Mike Parson’s administration is giving companies that sell plant-based and lab-grown meat until Jan. 1 to make sure they comply with a controversial new labeling law.In a statement issued Thursday, the Missouri Department of Agriculture said it was giving companies time to ensure their labels comply with the law that went into effect on Tuesday.The new law was part of a package of changes to state agriculture and conservation laws approved by wide margins in the House and Senate last spring.

The meat provision states that if a product isn’t derived from an actual cow, chicken, turkey or some other animal with two or four feet, it can’t be marketed as meat.Supporters said the measure will protect ranchers, pork producers and the state’s chicken and turkey farmers. But companies that produce plant-based patties, sausages and deli meat filed suit arguing that the law violates their free speech rights.In Thursday’s advisory, the department said it will not refer complaints to prosecutors if the labels on items like Tofurky products prominently use words like “plant-based,” “veggie,” “lab-grown” or “lab-created” before or immediately after the product name.Inspectors also will not refer cases if there is a prominent statement on the package that the product is “made from plants” or “grown in a lab.”
“Products that do not contain these statements or similar prominent statements should be more closely examined. If the product is marketed as a meat product but does not contain any disclosure that it is derived from sources other than harvested production livestock or poultry, then the product may be suspected of violating” the law, the agency said.A violation carries a penalty of up to one year in jail as well as a fine of as much as $1,000.Plant-based meats are typically made from soy, tempeh, wheat, jackfruit, textured vegetable protein or other vegan ingredients. So-called “clean meats” are made of muscle tissue cultured from animal cells.
The lawsuit says there is no evidence of consumer confusion about the ingredients or source of plant-based meat substitutes before the statute went into effect.“The Office of the Missouri Attorney General — the agency responsible for protecting consumers and preventing misleading business practices — has received zero complaints from consumers who accidentally purchased plant-based meats that they believed to be meat from slaughtered animals,” the lawsuit says.In a statement, the sponsor of Senate Bill 627, which included the fake meat provision, said the language is meant to protect consumers.“I am not sure why someone would be worried about ‘commercial free speech,’ unless that person or company wants to misrepresent where something comes from or what it is,” said state Sen. Brian Munzlinger, R-Williamstown. “This legislation is being attacked because we are the first state in the nation with the foresight and fortitude to pass this legislation.”

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri Gov. Mike Parson fills two more vacancies on the state's education board,"Aug 30, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/education/missouri-gov-mike-parson-fills-two-more-vacancies-on-the/article_36180b72-15b3-5c17-8aac-35cea2f541d2.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Gov. Mike Parson on Thursday appointed two new members to the state's Board of Education, which was hobbled and unable to meet under Parson's predecessor, former Gov. Eric Greitens.Parson named Kim Bailey of Raymore and Don Claycomb of Linn to the panel, which oversees K-12 education.According to a news release, Bailey holds a bachelor's in psychology from the University of Missouri-Columbia. She earned a master's degree in marriage and family therapy from Friends University.

Bailey, a Republican, is a licensed therapist and adjunct professor who has served on the Raymore Peculiar School Board and on the Raymore Home Educators Association, according to the release.Claycomb, an independent, earned a Ph.D. in education and a bachelor's degree in agriculture from the University of Missouri-Columbia. He has a master's in education from Northwest Missouri State University, according to the release.With the two nominations, the board now has seven of eight seats filled.St. Louis School Guide: Get test scores and moreGreitens, a Republican, stirred controversy in December when allies he had appointed to the board voted to oust popular Education Commissioner Margie Vandeven.Greitens withdrew and then resubmitted his five controversial nominations in January, allowing the Missouri Senate all spring to consider the nominations. Senators did not approve any of them.
Because the nominations were in limbo, the board did not have enough members to meet and was unable to consider Vandeven’s replacement. A short-lived search yielded 10 applications, but the applicants were told after they applied that the search was put on hold, Board President Charlie Shields said.Now, interim Commissioner Roger Dorson is leading the department. Shields said he had brought a “calming presence” to the department and educators. He said Dorson possessed valuable knowledge of the way district finances work and had earned the respect of senior staff.Shields has said the board would debate in September whether to launch another search for Vandeven's replacement.
Parson on Thursday also made six other appointments. Among the appointments: he named two Republicans to the state's Clean Water Commission.Republican Patricia Thomas, treasurer for the state party, was already on the panel but was serving an expired term. Parson reappointed her. He also named Allen Rowland, a Republican from Dexter, to the commission.

Missouri’s Clean Water Commission now has a majority of farm-friendly members as it considers granting permits to large factory farms.




With Rowland's appointment, the commission now has four Republicans, two Democrats and one independent, John Benton Hurst of Kansas City.Though Hurst is listed as an independent, he works for the Graves Garrett Law Firm in Kansas City, which often represents Republicans and Republican interests.State law forbids any more than four members of the same party from serving on the seven-member panel."
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,New state hiring and firing laws causing jitters among some Missouri workers,"Aug 28, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/new-state-hiring-and-firing-laws-causing-jitters-among-some/article_48e26d2c-ea54-5ca8-ac3a-64a502d910af.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • An overhaul of the state’s hiring system championed by former Gov. Eric Greitens went into effect Tuesday amid concern that it could trigger political retaliation.Natashia Pickens, the president of the Communications Workers of America Local 6355, told the Post-Dispatch that the new law was making some social service workers nervous.“We do work for the government,” Pickens said. “If I choose to support a candidate, and that candidate is of the opposite party, am I going to be at risk of losing my job? These are a lot of questions that we’ve had, and we’ve not been able to get any responses.”

Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican who took over after Greitens quit on June 1, hailed the new law, which he said would give the state greater flexibility in how it manages its workforce.“The new merit reform law will help us improve how state government operates for the benefit of both our citizens and our committed public servants by investing in new ways of working like never before,” Parson said.Under the state’s merit system, most employees are hired based on their performance on standardized tests, rather than their allegiance to a particular politician or political party.The new law removes the requirement that employees must rank in the top 15 percent of applicants — or in the top 15 applicants — to be selected for a state job. Now, workers need only meet the minimum requirements of the particular job class.The law also will streamline a hiring process that has sometimes led to 90-day wait times to hire job candidates.“Enabling managers to place the right employees in the right jobs, based on their skills and performance, will make their units more productive and allow managers to better recognize and reward employees for superior performance,” said Lt. Gov. Mike Kehoe, who sponsored the legislation in the Senate.
The changes are part of a deal the scandal-plagued Greitens laid out in his budget proposal in February, in which he said he’d sign off on small raises for the nation’s lowest-paid state workforce if lawmakers send him legislation that could make it easier for the governor’s administration to hire, fire and reward government workers.Lawmakers included $700-per-year raises in the budget, but the increase won’t go into effect until Jan. 1.The hiring changes also won’t immediately go into effect. State officials must first update the state’s personnel code and identify which pools of employees will lose their merit classification.
Opponents of the changes are concerned that the changes run counter to the reason the civil service system was developed when patronage and not skill or brainpower was a key factor in hiring.Pickens said many if not most of the employees the union represents at the Department of Social Services and the Department of Health and Senior Services still did not know how they would be affected by the new law. She said about 6,700 state workers were eligible to join the communications workers union, and she estimated the CWA had 1,100 members that were state employees.“We’ve asked which job classes are going to be covered and which job classes are going to be excluded,” Pickens said. “We’ve been told that they’re working on it and we’ll be updated. We’ve not gotten any word. We’ve talked to multiple members, and many of them don’t know if they’re covered or not.”She worries that the new law guts established processes that protected merit employees from frivolous complaints.“That goes away under the new merit system, because those protections are taken way,” Pickens said. “You can be fired for any reason and they don’t have to tell you what the reason is.”

Mike Parson appointed Missouri Highway Patrol Col. Sandra Karsten Monday as director of the Department of Public Safety.Karsten’s elevation to the post marks the first agency head appointed by Parson since he took over for former Gov. Eric Greitens on June 1.She replaces former public safety director Drew Juden, who was ousted by Parson last week, at the helm of the 15,000-employee agency. 

“Each of us know the public safety issues that we face today are more complex than ever before. Our commitment must be to work together as a team,” said Karsten, 60.Parson, a former Polk County sheriff, said one of his first requests of Karsten will be reaching out to officials in St. Louis and Kansas City to discuss gun violence.
“I’ve been open all along. I’m a very strong supporter of the Second Amendment. But I also realize at times if there is a way to do things better, then I’ll look at that,” Parson said. “Dealing with the crime rate here in Missouri will be a top priority.”
The Department of Public Safety oversees eight other agencies, including the highway patrol, Capitol Police, Fire Safety, Missouri National Guard, Alcohol & Tobacco Control, State Emergency Management Agency, Veterans Commission and Gaming Commission.Karsten, a Jefferson City resident, has been a member of the highway patrol since 1985, serving first as a trooper patrolling Callaway and Audrain counties before moving into administrative posts.Karsten graduated from Putnam County High School in Unionville and earned a Bachelor of Science in criminal justice from Truman State University and a master's degree in public administration from the University of Missouri.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"John McCain, 'maverick' of the Senate and former POW, dies at 81","Aug 26, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/national/john-mccain-maverick-of-the-senate-and-former-pow-dies/article_34304cfa-66bf-58af-b936-61e7a01c329e.html,"U.S. Sen. John McCain, the son and grandson of four-star admirals, was bred for combat. He endured more than five years of imprisonment and torture by the North Vietnamese as a young naval officer and went on to battle foes on the left and the right in Washington, driven throughout by a code of honor that both defined and haunted him.Sen. McCain, 81, died Aug. 25 at his ranch near Sedona, Ariz., his office announced in a statement. The senator was diagnosed last July with a brain tumor, and his family announced this week that he was discontinuing medical treatment.During three decades of representing Arizona in the Senate, he ran twice unsuccessfully for president. He lost a bitter primary campaign to George W. Bush and the Republican establishment in 2000. He then came back to win the nomination in 2008, only to be defeated in the general election by Barack Obama, a charismatic Illinois Democrat who had served less than one term as a senator.

A man who seemed his truest self when outraged, Sen. McCain reveled in going up against orthodoxy. The word ""maverick"" practically became a part of his name.Sen. McCain regularly struck at the canons of his party. He ran against the GOP grain by advocating campaign finance reform, liberalized immigration laws and a ban on the CIA's use of ""enhanced interrogation techniques"" — widely condemned as torture — against terrorism suspects.To win his most recent reelection battle in 2016, for a sixth term, he positioned himself as a more conventional Republican, unsettling many in his political fan base. But in the era of President Donald Trump, he again became an outlier.The terms of engagement between the two had been defined shortly after Trump became a presidential candidate and Sen. McCain commented that the celebrity real estate magnate had ""fired up the crazies."" At a rally in July 2015, Trump — who avoided the Vietnam draft with five deferments — spoke scornfully of Sen. McCain's military bona fides: ""He was a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren't captured.""Once Trump was in office, Sen. McCain was among his most vocal Republican critics, saying that the president had weakened the United States' standing in the world. He also warned that the spreading investigation over Trump's ties to Russia was ""reaching the point where it's of Watergate-size and scale.""Sen. McCain's most dramatic break with Trump came nine days after the Arizona senator announced on July 19, 2017, that he had been diagnosed with brain cancer. He returned to the Senate chamber, an incision from surgery still fresh above his left eye, and turned thumbs down on a GOP plan to replace the Affordable Care Act. Sen. McCain's no vote, along with those of two other Republicans, sent his party's signature legislative goal hurtling toward oblivion.In both of his own presidential races, Sen. McCain had dubbed his campaign bus the ""Straight Talk Express."" To the delight of reporters who traveled with him in 2000, he was accessible and unfiltered, a scrappy underdog who delighted in upsetting the Republican order.""He was always ready for the next experience, the next fight. Not just ready, but impatient for it,"" said his longtime aide Mark Salter, who co-authored more than a half-dozen books with the senator, including three memoirs, the final of which included a stinging critique of Trump. ""He took enjoyment from fighting, not winning or losing, as long as he believed he was fighting for a cause worth the trouble.""(Shortly after the announcement of McCain's death, President Trump said via Twitter: ""My deepest sympathies and respect go out to the family of Senator John McCain. Our hearts and prayers are with you!"")
My deepest sympathies and respect go out to the family of Senator John McCain. Our hearts and prayers are with you!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 26, 2018

So broad and party-bending was his appeal that Senate Democrats in 2001 quietly tried to persuade him to become one of them. In 2004, Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry, a Senate colleague who later became Obama's secretary of state, considered offering Sen. McCain the second spot on his ticket.Sen. McCain's 2008 presidential campaign turned out to be a far more conventional operation than his first bid for the White House. He stuck to his talking points and came to represent the status quo that he had once promised to topple.One move, however, would come to be regarded as a reckless political gambit. Sen. McCain picked as his vice-presidential running mate the little-known, thinly vetted governor of Alaska, Sarah Palin.Her well-received convention speech initially gave the sagging Republican nominee a lift, and her independent streak reinforced Sen. McCain's message and reputation. Looking back on the decision in 2012, Sen. McCain said he had been looking for ""a way to galvanize and energize our campaign.""But Palin's performance in interviews and on the stump sowed doubts about whether she was prepared to be next in line for the presidency and, by Election Day, polls indicated that she had become a drag on his candidacy.When he acted like an ordinary politician, trimming principles in the cause of ambition and expedience, it was all the more jarring because of the standard he had set. In the years that followed, a question often asked was: Which is the real John McCain?He represented the end of an era during which the nation looked at wartime military experience as practically mandatory for those who aspire to high office. ""McCain was part of the tradition of being able to say, 'I did public service when I was young,'"" historian Douglas Brinkley said.Sen. McCain, who rose to become chairman of the Armed Services Committee, was among the Republicans' most hawkish leaders on military matters and foreign affairs.It was a mind-set that came, in part, from his conviction that the Vietnam War, in which he had suffered grievously, was a noble and winnable endeavor. The real failure, he believed, was that of a spineless political class.During the Iraq War, often compared to Vietnam, Sen. McCain was an early and ardent proponent of a 2007 ""surge"" of troops. President Bush ultimately adopted that strategy, and it was widely credited with stabilizing Iraq, albeit temporarily.Sen. McCain was also a persistent critic of Obama's foreign policy.""The demand for our leadership in the world has never been greater. People don't want less of America — they want more,"" Sen. McCain said in 2012. ""Everywhere I go in the world, people tell me that they still have faith in America. What they want to know is whether we still have faith in ourselves.""________John Sidney McCain III was born Aug. 29, 1936, in the Panama Canal Zone and into a family whose military lineage included an ancestor who served as an aide to Gen. George Washington during the Revolutionary War.He was named for the first father and son in Navy history to become full admirals: John S. ""Slew"" McCain Sr., a top Pacific-theater commander in World War II, and John S. McCain Jr., commander for all armed forces in the Pacific during the Vietnam War.The middle of three children, Sen. McCain manifested his famously hot temper early: As a toddler, he would hold his breath until he blacked out. His tantrums were so severe that a Navy doctor advised his father and mother, the former Roberta Wright, to drop him, fully clothed, into a bathtub of icy water at the first sign of an outburst.After transient early years spent mostly at military bases, he graduated in 1954 from a Virginia boarding school, Episcopal High School in Alexandria. Following his father's and grandfather's path, and his parents' often-stated expectations, Sen. McCain then enrolled at the U.S. Naval Academy, which he later recalled as ""a place I belonged at but dreaded.""At Annapolis, he rebelled against the hazing and the regulations and racked up so many demerits that he was at risk of expulsion. (That, too, was something of a family tradition.) As Sen. McCain often boasted later in life, he graduated fifth from the bottom of the 899-member class of 1958.From there, he headed to Pensacola, Fla., to be trained as a Navy pilot and continue the rowdy existence of his days at the academy.One girlfriend at the time was a stripper who went by the professional name Marie, the Flame of Florida. Sen. McCain recalled taking her as his date to a party of young officers and their mannerly wives. Marie became bored, drew a switchblade from her purse, popped it open and cleaned her fingernails.He did a stint as a flight instructor in Meridian, Miss., at McCain Field, named for his grandfather. It was there, Sen. McCain recalled, that he matured and became dedicated to distinguishing himself as a pilot.""As a boy and young man, I may have pretended not to be affected by the family history, but my studied indifference was a transparent mask to those who knew me well,"" the senator wrote in a 1999 memoir of his early life, ""Faith of My Fathers,"" co-authored by Salter. ""As it was for my forebears, my family's history was my pride.""Sen. McCain also became involved in a serious romance, with Carol Shepp of Philadelphia, whom he had known since his days at the academy. They wed in July 1965, and he soon adopted her two sons from a previous marriage, Douglas and Andrew. The couple later had a daughter, Sidney.Sen. McCain requested and got orders to do a Vietnam combat tour, joining a squadron on the supercarrier Forrestal in the Tonkin Gulf. On July 29, 1967, having flown five uneventful bombing runs over North Vietnam, he was preparing for takeoff when a missile accidentally fired from a nearby fighter struck the fuel tank of his A-4 Skyhawk, Sen. McCain wrote in his memoir. It set off explosions and a fire that killed 134 crewmen, destroyed more than 20 planes and disabled the ship so severely that it took two years to repair.His own injuries being relatively — and miraculously — minor, Sen. McCain, then a lieutenant commander, volunteered for dangerous duty on the undermanned carrier Oriskany. He joined a squadron nicknamed the Saints that was known for its daring; that year, one-third of its pilots would be killed or captured.________On Oct. 26, 1967, Sen. McCain was on his 23rd mission and his first attack on the enemy capital, Hanoi. He dove his A-4 on a thermal power plant near a lake in the center of the city.As he released his bombs on the target, a Russian-made missile the size of a telephone pole blew off his right wing. The lieutenant commander pulled his ejection-seat handle and was knocked unconscious by the force as he was hurled from the plane. He came to when he hit the lake, where a mob of Vietnamese had gathered.With both arms and his right knee broken, he was dragged from the lake, beaten with a rifle butt and stabbed in the foot with a bayonet. Then Sen. McCain was taken to the French-built prison that American POWs had dubbed the ""Hanoi Hilton.""So began 5½ years of torture and imprisonment, nearly half of it spent in solitary confinement. During that time, his only means of communicating with other prisoners was by tapping out the alphabet through the walls.At first, his family was told that he was probably dead. The front page of the New York Times carried a headline: Adm. McCain's Son, Forrestal Survivor, Is Missing in Raid.The North Vietnamese, however, perceived that there was propaganda value in the prisoner. They called him the ""crown prince"" and assigned a cellmate to nurse him back to health. As brutal as his treatment was, Sen. McCain later said, prisoners who lacked his celebrity endured worse.Shortly before his father assumed command of the war in the Pacific in 1968, Sen. McCain was offered early release. He refused because it would have been a violation of the Navy code of conduct, which prohibited him from accepting freedom before those who had been held longer.""I knew that every prisoner the Vietnamese tried to break, those who had arrived before me and those who would come after me, would be taunted with the story of how an admiral's son had gone home early, a lucky beneficiary of America's class-conscious society,"" Sen. McCain recalled. ""I knew that my release would add to the suffering of men who were already straining to keep faith with their country.""His lowest point came after extensive beatings that broke his left arm again and cracked his ribs. Ultimately, he agreed to sign a vague, stilted confession that said he had committed what his captors called ""black crimes.""""I still wince when I recall wondering if my father had heard of my disgrace,"" Sen. McCain wrote. ""The Vietnamese had broken the prisoner they called the 'Crown Prince,' and I knew they had done it to hurt the man they believed to be a king.""In March 1973, nearly two months after the Paris peace accords were signed, Sen. McCain and the other prisoners were released in four increments, in the order in which they had been captured. He was 36 years old and emaciated.The effects of his injuries lingered for the rest of his life: Sen. McCain was unable to lift his arms enough to comb his own prematurely gray hair, could only shrug off his suit jacket and walked with a stiff-legged gait.
________Sen. McCain had hoped to remain in the Navy, but it became clear that his disabilities would limit his prospects for advancement.In the meantime, he found himself drawn toward the civilian world of politics — and it toward him. Hobbling on crutches in his dress-white service uniform, he shook President Richard M. Nixon's hand. Sen. McCain also struck up a friendship with then-California Gov. Ronald Reagan, who invited the former POW to speak at an annual prayer breakfast in Sacramento.He developed a network of political contacts while working in the Navy's legislative affairs operation in the late 1970s. His office on the first floor of the Russell Senate Office Building was a popular late-afternoon socializing spot for younger senators and their staffs.Sen. McCain's marriage, meanwhile, frayed and fell apart. That was not an unusual story among returning Vietnam POWs, and in his case, the dissolution was aggravated by his infidelities.While he and his wife were separated, Sen. McCain visited Hawaii, where he met Cindy Hensley, the daughter of a wealthy Arizona beer distributor. A few months after his divorce became final in 1980, he married Hensley. Then-Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine, later to be a defense secretary, was his best man, and then-Sen. Gary Hart, D-Colo., a future presidential contender, was an usher.The couple had three children: Meghan McCain, who became a media personality and blogger, and sons Jimmy McCain and Jack McCain, both of whom served in the military. They also adopted a daughter, Bridget McCain, whom Cindy had met while visiting an orphanage in Bangladesh.Besides his mother, his wife and seven children, survivors include a brother, Joseph McCain of Washington; a sister, Jean McCain Morgan of Annapolis, Maryland; and five grandchildren.Sen. McCain retired from the Navy at the rank of captain and moved to Arizona in 1981, with an eye toward running for Congress. The opportunity presented itself the following January when a longtime Republican congressman, John Rhodes, announced his retirement. That same day, the McCains bought a house in Rhodes's Phoenix district, and John McCain was soon in a race against three other candidates.He was called an opportunist and a carpetbagger — accusations he dispatched with a single answer at a candidate forum.""I wish I could have had the luxury, like you, of growing up and spending my entire life in a nice place like the 1st District of Arizona, but I was doing other things,"" he replied to one critic. ""As a matter of fact, when I think about it now, the place I lived longest in my life was Hanoi.""He won the primary by six points and breezed through the general election. Four years later, in 1986, he was elected in a landslide to the Senate, replacing the retiring Barry Goldwater, one of the most influential conservative politicians of the 20th century.John McCain was a Capitol Hill celebrity from the moment he was elected to the House.In many areas, he was a reliably conservative voice and vote. But from the beginning, he showed what became a trademark streak of independence. He called for the withdrawal of Marines from Lebanon in 1983 after a terrorist bombing left 241 U.S. service members dead; he voted to override President Reagan's veto of sanctions against the apartheid regime of South Africa in 1986.And — surprisingly to many — as a member of the Senate, he worked to normalize relations with Vietnam.Sen. McCain crusaded against pork-barrel spending, the practice by which lawmakers direct taxpayer money to projects in their districts. He was also the only Republican to vote against the Telecommunications Act of 1996, a deregulation measure he said had been ""written by every [special] interest in the world except the consumers.""
Acclaimed by the media, he was not popular in the Senate. Many of his colleagues were put off by his certitude.""John puts things in terms of black and white, right and wrong,"" then-Sen. Tim Hutchinson, R-Ark., told The Washington Post in 2000. ""If you disagree with him, you're wrong. He doesn't see that there could be legitimate differences of opinion that deserve respect.""One of the greatest setbacks for Sen. McCain, who had styled himself an idealist and a reformer, came in 1989, when his name became associated with a scandal. He and four other senators — all Democrats — were accused of trying to pressure federal bank regulators to back off an investigation of Charles Keating Jr., a high-living Arizona businessman whose savings and loan collapsed and cost taxpayers more than $3 billion.Over the years, Keating had contributed heavily to Sen. McCain's House and Senate campaigns. The senator's family had taken at least nine trips, at Keating's expense, to the Bahamas, where Keating had a luxurious vacation estate.Sen. McCain and the four Democrats — Alan Cranston of California, Dennis DeConcini of Arizona, John Glenn of Ohio and Donald Riegle Jr. of Michigan, all of whom had also benefited from Keating's largesse — became known as the ""Keating Five.""The Senate Ethics Committee finally determined that Sen. McCain had not done anything more serious than showing ""poor judgment"" by attending two meetings with the regulators and the four other senators. It was the lightest reprimand the committee gave in connection with the scandal. The others were rebuked but were not charged with crimes.Sen. McCain felt that he bore a permanent taint. ""It will be on my tombstone, something that will always be with me, something that will always be in my biography,"" he said, ""and deservedly so.""The experience also lit the fire for what would become his signature issue and biggest legislative achievement: an overhaul of campaign finance laws. Sen. McCain teamed up with one of the Senate's most liberal members, Russell Feingold, D-Wis., to author a measure that called for the most dramatic change to the system since the post-Watergate reforms of 1974.It took them more than seven years to get the legislation through. The 2002 law's main thrust was to ban unlimited, unregulated ""soft money"" donations to parties, which were used as a means of skirting the contribution limits to individual candidates.In less than a decade, however, the Supreme Court's Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission decision opened the money floodgate and led to the rise of super PACs, which can spend unlimited sums, as long as they do not coordinate directly with candidates. Sen. McCain called it ""the worst decision of the United States Supreme Court in the 21st century.""________When Sen. McCain announced in September 1999 that he was running for the Republican nomination for president, it was yet another assault on the political establishment, which had put its chips on then-Texas Gov. Bush, the son of a former president.""In truth, I had had the ambition for a long time. It had been a vague aspiration,"" he later wrote. ""It had been there, in the back of my mind, for years, as if it were simply a symptom of my natural restlessness. Life is forward motion for me.""He ran as a truth-telling reformer, held a record-setting 114 town hall meetings in New Hampshire (while effectively ignoring the Iowa caucuses) and pulled off a stunning 18-point victory over Bush in the Granite State's first-in-the-nation primary. But his campaign ran aground in South Carolina in what came to be regarded as the nastiest primary in memory.Sen. McCain was the target of rumors: that he had fathered a black child (twisting the facts about his dark-skinned adopted daughter); that his wife had a drug habit (she acknowledged having been addicted to painkillers and stealing them from a charity she ran); that his years as a POW had left him brainwashed and insane.One of his regrets, he later said, was getting tangled up in South Carolina's emotional debate over flying the Confederate flag at the capitol in Columbia. After describing the banner as ""a symbol of racism and slavery,"" Sen. McCain bowed to the pleas of his panicked strategists and issued a statement saying he could ""understand both sides"" of the question.Later, he wrote that he regretted not having told the truth, which was that he believed ""the flag should be lowered forever from the staff atop South Carolina's capitol.""""I had not been just dishonest. I had been a coward, and I had severed my own interests from my country's. That was what made the lie unforgivable,"" he recalled. ""All my heroes, fictional and real, would have been ashamed of me.""Bush handily defeated Sen. McCain in South Carolina, beginning the end of the senator's insurgent campaign. In April, a month after he dropped out of the 2000 race, Sen. McCain returned to the state and publicly apologized for having chosen ""to compromise my principles. I broke my promise to always tell the truth.""The bitterness of that campaign lingered for much of Bush's presidency. Sen. McCain was, for instance, one of only two Senate Republicans to vote against Bush's 2001 tax cuts. He said they were fiscally irresponsible and benefited ""the most fortunate among us, at the expense of middle-class Americans who most need tax relief.""But by the time he ran again in 2008, Sen. McCain had come to terms with Bush and the Republican Party, and they with him. He not only voted to extend the tax cuts in 2006, but also advocated making them permanent.Whereas Sen. McCain had lashed out at evangelical leaders Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell as ""agents of intolerance"" during his first presidential bid, he delivered the commencement address at Falwell's Liberty University in 2006. Falwell introduced him with lavish praise, saying, ""The ilk of John McCain is very scarce, very small.""The shift rightward caused a breach with a constituency that Sen. McCain had long counted as in his corner: the media.""Are you going into crazy base world?"" comedian Jon Stewart asked Sen. McCain during an appearance on Comedy Central's ""The Daily Show"" a few weeks before the speech at Liberty.""I'm afraid so,"" Sen. McCain deadpanned.His campaign all but collapsed in the summer of 2007, but Sen. McCain battled back and won the nomination.Still, he was flying into head winds in the general election. The war in Iraq, which he had supported, was unpopular, as was the Republican incumbent in the White House. Palin's erratic, unprepared performance became a story in itself.Most important, he was up against a Democrat who seemed tailor-made for that moment in history: Obama was better financed, ran a better campaign, had opposed the Iraq War and offered the captivating prospect of putting an African American in the White House for the first time.Nonetheless, the race looked as if it could be close until the final weeks, when the financial system went into a meltdown. Sen. McCain, so sure of himself on national security issues, seemed less than savvy at handling economic ones. Even as the crash was building into the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, the senator declared that ""the fundamentals of our economy are strong.""Returning to Congress, Sen. McCain became a frequent antagonist of the man who had defeated him for president. He contended for instance that Russian President Vladimir Putin's 2014 invasion of Crimea was a result of ""a feckless foreign policy where nobody believes in America's strength anymore.""When Sen. McCain got the gavel of the Armed Services Committee in 2015, he told The Post that he was having more fun than at any time since his 2000 presidential campaign. That same year, he announced plans to run for a sixth term in the Senate.Sen. McCain won handily, and in his victory speech to supporters, he predicted that campaign ""might be the last.""""Thank you one last time,"" he added, ""for making me the luckiest guy I know.""In his final book, reflecting on his life as it came to an end, McCain wrote: ""It's been quite a ride. I've known great passions, seen amazing wonders, fought in a war, and helped make a peace. I made a small place for myself in the story of America and the history of my times."""

John McCain, who died Saturday:Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo.: “As I served with John McCain he became one of my heroes. We didn’t always agree but he was always motivated to do what he thought was the right thing.”U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo. (via Twitter): “I feel so fortunate that I had a chance to learn from him and laugh with him. He was a tremendous role model for our democracy and gave his life to the public good. My love to the McCain family. There’ll never be another like John McCain.”

U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill. (via Twitter): “My friend and America’s hero, John McCain, landed safely tonight at Heaven’s gates.”Rep. Blaine Luetkemeyer, R-Mo.: “Today, the world has lost a great American hero. Senator John McCain served our nation for more than half a century, dedicating his life as a distinguished member of the United States Navy and the United States Senate. Please join me in keeping his wife Cindy and his loving family in your thoughts and prayers this evening.”Rep. Mike Bost, R-Ill. (via Twitter): “Tracy and I send our prayers to the McCain family during this very difficult time. Senator McCain, you will be truly missed.”
Rep. John Shimkus, R-Ill. “Senator John McCain devoted his life to the country he loved and served as the very model of a warrior and statesman. The legacy of his many decades of public service left no question that he unapologetically put country first. My thoughts and prayers are with his family, loved ones, and our nation that now mourns his passing.”U.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill.: “My heart is heavy today as I join countless Americans across our country in mourning the loss of one of our nation’s greatest leaders and statesmen, one of my personal heroes, Senator John McCain. Throughout his life — as a naval aviator, a prisoner of war who endured years of torture, a congressman, and a six-term senator — John repeatedly showed how anything is possible when armed with determination, a deep sense of patriotism and an unbreakable will.”
Other elected officials:Missouri Gov. Mike Parson (via Twitter): “Saddened to hear about the passing of a great veteran and public servant Senator John McCain. Our prayers are with his family.”Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley (via Twitter): “America has lost a great man and war hero. Sen. John McCain and his family are in our thoughts and prayers.”Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner (via Twitter): “It’s heartbreaking to hear the latest news from Senator John McCain. He’s a true American hero and a patriot.”

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Attorneys make plea for man facing execution for killing former Post-Dispatch reporter,"Aug 23, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/attorneys-make-plea-for-man-facing-execution-for-killing-former/article_cc0a906b-8ac3-5016-8efc-0de8c653fd87.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Attorneys for a man facing execution for the murder of a former Post-Dispatch reporter spent more than an hour behind closed doors Wednesday with a special panel of judges who could help decide his fate.In a meeting that came exactly one year after then-Gov. Eric Greitens stopped the execution of Marcellus Williams, the legal team presented an abbreviated version of Williams’ case.











Marcellus Williams, who was convicted of fatally stabbing a former Post-Dispatch reporter in 1998, was set for execution, but the governor granted a stay.




Attorney Barry Scheck, who also defended O.J. Simpson in 1994, said the meeting was “very professional, very thorough.”“We appreciate it,” said Scheck, who told reporters that he could not discuss details of the proceedings before the judges.Another of Williams’ attorneys, Kent Gipson of Kansas City, said the scene was not as formal as a public court proceeding.“The board was very attentive. They gave both sides ample opportunity to say what needed to be said,” Gipson said. “Certainly, everybody got to be heard.”Williams was sentenced to death in 2001 for the brutal stabbing murder of former Post-Dispatch reporter and University City resident Lisha Gayle in 1998.Williams was hours from being executed last August when Greitens stopped the process and invoked a rarely used state law to appoint five judges to review the case and recommend life or death.In June, after Greitens quit, Gov. Mike Parson directed the panel of retired jurists to continue its work.Prosecutors said Williams was burglarizing Gayle’s home in University City when she surprised him. Gayle, who left the paper in 1992, fought for her life as she was stabbed repeatedly.











Lisha Gayle, a former Post-Dispatch reporter, was stabbed to death by a burglar in her University City home on Aug. 11, 1998.






The Missouri Supreme Court in 2015 postponed Williams’ execution to allow time for the DNA tests. Using technology that was not available at the time of the killing, those tests show that DNA found on the knife matched that of an unknown male. Williams’ DNA was not found on the knife.
Despite that finding, the state’s high court denied his petition to stop the execution and either appoint a special master to hear his innocence claim or vacate the death sentence and order his sentence commuted to life in prison.Attorneys representing the state did not comment on Wednesday’s hearing.Nimrod Chapel, president of the Missouri NAACP, said the session represented the “last and final venue” for Williams.
“The evidence that’s been presented would indicate that he needs a fair shake at justice,” Chapel told reporters gathered outside the meeting.Cassandra Gould, pastor of Quinn Chapel AME Church in Jefferson City, said she was praying that “there is no more black blood spilled into the ground.”“We pray that justice will actually be done,” Gould said.Williams’ son, Marcellus, said he talked to his father on Tuesday.“I talk to him all the time. We talk about regular things. He’s always in good spirits,” the younger Williams said.Despite the slow pace, Williams said he was hopeful his father would be taken off death row or freed by Parson.“I’m feeling really good about it,” Williams said. “Slow motion doesn’t mean no motion. I’m good with that.”It is unclear when the committee will make a recommendation to the governor.Members of the panel are former U.S. District Judge Carol Jackson, former 22nd Circuit Judge Michael David, former Circuit Judge Peggy Fenner of Jackson County, former Missouri Court of Appeals Western District Judge Paul Spinden and former Circuit Judge Ellen Roper of Boone County.

Mike Parson’s administration.Rep. Robert Cornejo, a Republican who represents parts of St. Charles and Lincoln counties, has been in office since 2012 and was running unopposed for re-election in November.In a letter to Parson, Cornejo said it had been a privilege to serve the residents of the 64th House District.

Parson announced Wednesday morning that he was appointing Cornejo to be chairman of the Labor and Industrial Relations Commission, a three-member board that oversees the state’s Department of Labor and Industrial Relations. The appointment must be confirmed by the state Senate.“Robert brings the experience necessary to his new role as Chairman of the Labor and Industrial Relations Commission,” Parson, a Republican, said in a written statement. “His effectiveness in handling multiple projects ranging from constituent concerns to passing legislation at such a high level of quality gives him the qualifications needed to oversee this commission.”Commissioners are paid about $107,000. Members of the General Assembly are paid $35,000.
In the Missouri House, Cornejo served as chairman of the General Laws Committee. Cornejo, a lawyer, was unsuccessful in a bid last year to become speaker of the House.Prior to his tenure in the House, Cornejo interned for then-U.S. Sen. Jim Talent.
Cornejo is a 2001 graduate of Hazelwood Central High School and earned degrees in political science and international business from Washington University in St. Louis. He received his law degree from the University of Missouri in 2008.He could not be reached for comment Wednesday.A committee of local Republicans will be able to appoint a replacement on the November ballot.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri officials opening up state lakes to help drought-battered ranchers,"Aug 20, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-officials-opening-up-state-lakes-to-help-drought-battered/article_e25672d8-8cb0-5028-9a13-68848970e1a1.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • With a severe drought clobbering Missouri farm country, officials outlined plans Monday aimed at addressing water and feed shortages for livestock operations across the state.Among them is an initiative that will allow ranchers to pump water out of nearly 28 state-owned lakes to supplement drying farm ponds that were never fully replenished during the winter months.Calling the conditions in 86 of the state’s 114 counties “very serious,” Gov. Mike Parson said the state also will open an estimated 900 acres of public land to a lottery so ranchers can cut hay to feed their cattle.

Parson, who runs a cattle farm in Bolivar, is among those who have had to feed hay to his herd because his pastures haven’t been able to support normal summer grazing. He said he’s never had to do that in August in his life.“This is a long way from being over,” Parson, who is 62, said. “Some people are not going to make it.”The drought in Missouri has been brought on by below-average rainfall affecting about 98 percent of the state. Twenty-five Missouri counties have been declared disaster areas by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, triggering emergency loan assistance.

Missouri Department of Agriculture Director Chris Chin said ranchers are culling their herds and importing hay from out of state to keep their operations afloat.The state has eased permitting regulations and waived fees on hay hauling to assist farmers trying to get feed to their herds. But, she said, the cost of hay has risen quickly as demand has grown, putting some farmers at a financial disadvantage.“When our farmers hurt, our communities hurt too,” Chin said.Sean Cornelius, a dairy farmer from Hamilton in the hard-hit northwest region of the state, said he’s seen just 3.2 inches of rain since May. He said opening access to water in state parks and conservation areas will be a “super help.”
“We’ll do the best with what we have,” Cornelius said.Most of the pumping locations are north of Interstate 70 at places like Crowder and Wakonda state parks and Bonanza Conservation Area. In order to pump water out of the impoundments, farmers must contact the Department of Natural Resources at 573-751-4115, ext. 3209.Farmers are limited to 5,000 gallons of water per farm per day. Farmers can apply for the hay lottery through Saturday. One farmer from each location will be issued a permit that will allow haying on state grasslands from Aug. 27 through Nov. 27.
Its not just farmers facing hardship.In Cameron, near St. Joseph, officials declared a water emergency last week. The designation bars residents and businesses from watering their lawns and flowers. Other restrictions include prohibiting restaurants from serving water unless it is specifically requested by a customer. People violating the order face fines of $100 per day.To help shore up supplies for its 10,000 customers, the city has received permission to draw water from Pony Express Lake.In Hamilton, city administrator Jean Van Aperen said officials are searching for a nearby water district to help augment their supplies. The northwest Missouri town of 1,800 residents has been under restrictions similar to those in Cameron since May.Thus far, she said no fines have been issued.“If we see someone violating the rules, we try to educate them on why they are in place. So far it has worked,” Van Aperen said.Parson said he hopes the state assistance will ease the pressure on the state’s agriculture industry.“We can’t fix the rain. It’s a little bit above our pay grades,” he said.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Gov. Parson ousts Missouri's top cop,"Aug 18, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/gov-parson-ousts-missouri-s-top-cop/article_f6057808-69f3-536d-aa62-9807bca9035f.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • In the first staff shake-up since Gov. Mike Parson took office, the director of the Missouri Department of Public Safety is being replaced at the end of the month.Drew Juden, who was appointed to the post in January 2017 by then-Gov. Eric Greitens, is leaving his $116,000-per-year job at the request of Parson.“I think the governor was just looking for a different approach,” spokeswoman Kelli Jones told the Post-Dispatch.

Jones said there was no specific event or policy decision by Juden that led to his firing.“As a former law enforcement officer, the governor was just wanting to go in a different direction,” Jones said.Since taking office June 1 after Greitens quit, Parson has kept top agency officials in place, saying that his predecessor had chosen a good team to manage state government.Juden was among a contingent of agency chiefs at the governor’s annual ham breakfast event at the Missouri State Fair on Thursday.Prior to joining Greitens’ administration, Juden oversaw both the police and fire departments in Sikeston, population 16,000. He also is a former president of the Missouri Police Chiefs Association.
Juden, who has worked in law enforcement for more than 40 years, came under fire last summer when Greitens said Juden had investigated problems at the St. Louis Veterans Home and found no issues.After outcry by then-Lt. Gov. Parson, residents, families and lawmakers, Greitens led a major shakeup of the agency that oversees the home.
As a Sikeston police officer, Juden also was involved in a botched case that garnered attention earlier this year.In August 2000, Juden was the arresting officer when David Robinson was charged with the murder of Sheila Box. Juden also supervised the detective who put together the case that led to Robinson being convicted.This year, however, the Missouri Supreme Court ruled that Robinson should be released from prison after 16 years because of serious questions about the case, including witnesses that recanted their testimony.Missouri State Highway Patrol Colonel Sandra Karsten will take over for Juden in an acting capacity while a search is underway for a new top cop.“Colonel Karsten has a long track record of being a top-notch professional and an exemplary public servant. We are confident in her leadership during this transition,” Parson said in a prepared statement.“Governor Parson asked if I would be willing to assist during the Department’s transition, and I am more than happy to help. Ensuring the public’s safety has been a top priority in my 33-year career in law enforcement, and it always will be,” Karsten said.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri auditor candidate says her financial woes won't stop her from running,"Aug 16, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-auditor-candidate-says-her-financial-woes-won-t-stop/article_3ba5c5f6-eef8-5373-a1d7-e09fd578e686.html,"SEDALIA, Mo. • The Republican candidate for Missouri auditor says she’s staying in the race despite questions over her finances and whether she qualifies for the ballot.Saundra McDowell, an attorney from Jefferson City, told the Post-Dispatch on Thursday that she is in the midst of ramping up her general election campaign against current auditor Nicole Galloway, a Democrat from Columbia.“We’re ready to get going. I’m just trying to get the best people on my team right now and get that set up,” McDowell said. “You’re going to see a lot of me out there.”

Her comments came as politicians descended on the Missouri State Fair for the annual Governor’s Ham Breakfast event hosted by Gov. Mike Parson. Among the dozens of state, local and federal elected officials attending the morning gathering was Galloway, who has slammed McDowell’s credentials.“For me, I think that there is no question that she’s not qualified to be the state’s auditor. Given her poor track record of financial management, why would taxpayers turn over a billion-dollar checkbook to her?” said Galloway, a certified public accountant.McDowell’s candidacy has been under scrutiny since she joined the race late last year. Along with being ordered to pay $32,658 to a Springfield landlord in 2015 after she and her husband, Jonathan, stopped paying rent on a home, McDowell may not have lived in Missouri long enough to qualify for the office.The state constitution requires the auditor to be a resident for 10 years. McDowell, who moved to Missouri in 2010, said she qualifies because she was in law school the previous two years and had intended to move to the state where her husband is from once she finished.Despite the questions, McDowell won last week’s four-way Republican Party primary race last week, amassing 32.5 percent of the vote.Missouri Republican Party Chairman Todd Graves, a Kansas City attorney, said the party is not attempting to get McDowell off the ballot.“Saundra McDowell was elected in the Republican primary, and the Republican Party supports its candidates,” Graves told the Post-Dispatch.
McDowell also said she’s got solid support from the party.“The GOP is proudly supporting me. I’ve had a lot of communication with them,” McDowell said.
Parson, meanwhile, was in his element.Hosting his first ham breakfast after taking over for scandal-plagued former Gov. Eric Greitens on June 1, Parson, a cattle farmer, reveled in the crossroads of politics and rural Missouri.“I’m still living the dream,” Parson told the estimated 1,000 attendees.Parson focused his comments on his efforts to convince voters to support a phased-in, 10-cent increase in the state’s 17-cent per gallon gasoline tax. In one of their final acts of the spring legislative session, lawmakers placed the question on the November ballot.If approved, the estimated $293 million generated by the higher taxes would go toward overhauling the state’s roads and bridges.Parson also expressed concern about the drought affecting much of the state. He said he has already fed his cattle hay because of a shortfall of forage.“I have never fed hay in August before in my farming career. Anytime you’re feeding hay in August for livestock producers is not a good sign,” Parson said.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"After last year's turmoil, Missouri's department of education is still without top official","Aug 15, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/education/after-last-year-s-turmoil-missouri-s-department-of-education/article_8a3b1ac8-3ae3-5579-9bdf-a2f58dc9cb19.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Eight months after allies of then-Gov. Eric Greitens booted the state’s education commissioner from her perch, the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education still is without a permanent leader.But that’s not necessarily a bad thing, state Board of Education President Charlie Shields told the Post-Dispatch on Wednesday. He said the Board of Education, which oversees K-12 public schools in the state, is in no rush to fill the vacancy.“We have a department that is functioning very well under the interim commissioner,” Shields said.

After Greitens’ five appointees to the school board voted to oust then-Education Commissioner Margie Vandeven in December, the state embarked on a search to find her replacement.But the search was short-lived. Greitens, a Republican, withdrew his nominations to the board as the Senate convened in January. He then reappointed them. The parliamentary maneuver in effect gave the Senate all spring to consider the nominees. Senators did not confirm any of them.Because the nominations were in limbo, the board did not have enough members to meet until June and was unable to consider Vandeven’s replacement. The search yielded 10 applications, but the applicants were told after they applied that the search was put on hold, Shields said.Now, interim Commissioner Roger Dorson is leading the department. Shields said he had brought a “calming presence” to the department and educators. He said Dorson possessed valuable knowledge of the way district finances work and had earned the respect of senior staff.Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican, appointed two new members to the Board of Education in June, giving the panel enough members to meet. Three vacancies remain, which Shields expects Parson to fill by the end of the year.

At the board’s Sept. 18 meeting, Shields said, he will ask the panel members what they think about moving forward with a search. He said there were pros and cons to launching another search.
“The positive is you might find a truly great candidate out there,” Shields said. The negative, he said, is that the department becomes zeroed-in on finding a new candidate.“Political forces” come out to support their preferred candidate, he said. The search, he said, would last at least six months.“You’re really putting the department on pause while you’re doing the search,” Shields said. “Constituencies begin to advocate for different candidates, so that can also become very distracting.”Shields said voting to make Dorson to head the department permanently was “certainly a possibility.”
Shields said the board could also find a qualified candidate without doing a full-scale search.“There’s no requirement that you have to do a search,” Shields said.Dorson has more than 30 years of experience in education, according to his department biography.He holds a bachelor’s degree in education and a master’s degree in secondary education from what is now Truman State University, and has a doctorate from the University of Missouri-Columbia.Dorson began his career as a social studies teacher before becoming an administrator. He eventually became superintendent of schools in Salisbury, Mo., a role he held for 18 years, according to the biography.He then began moving up the ranks within the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education."
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Gov. Parson's office says it's not processing Greitens-era Sunshine request. Then says it is.,"Aug 15, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/gov-parson-s-office-says-it-s-not-processing-greitens/article_d4b292e3-2dc6-5deb-bda7-2be49e4024ba.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Missouri Gov. Mike Parson's team is still processing an open-records request dating to a more chaotic era in state politics.Attorney General Josh Hawley's office filed the Sunshine request with former Gov. Eric Greitens' office on May 11. Hawley, a Republican, was investigating whether Greitens, a Republican, and his team broke a Missouri law that forbids taxpayer-paid employees from working on political projects.When Greitens resigned on June 1, Greitens' legal team told the attorney general's office the governor's office was closing the request. But it also said the office could ""resubmit"" its request to the Parson administration.

Parson's office told the Post-Dispatch in June and on Tuesday that the office was not processing that particular request.When told this on Tuesday, the Post-Dispatch contacted the attorney general's office to ask about the apparent inaction.Later that day, a Parson spokesman called to say the governor's office was mistaken. The administration was pulling the files, after all.""I apologize for any confusion,"" said Steele Shippy, communications director for Parson, a Republican. It remains unclear to what extent anyone was working to fulfill this request over the summer.When pressed for an explanation, Shippy said in an email: ""Today is not the first day this Sunshine request has been talked about or worked on. Our office reviewed this Sunshine request shortly after taking office and we are working to fully comply with the request.""Mary Compton, spokeswoman for the attorney general's office, said in an email Wednesday morning: ""The Governor’s Office has confirmed to us that they are still processing our Sunshine request.""In the request, Hawley’s general counsel Michael Martinich-Sauter asked for any emails between the governor’s office and Austin Chambers, a top Greitens political adviser, and any emails to C5 Consulting, a now-defunct political shop owned by Vice President Mike Pence’s chief of staff, Nick Ayers.
The office also wanted any emails to Greitens’ personal confidants, Mark and Chris Bobak, as well as any emails to the Greitens Group, Greitens’ campaign treasurer Jeff Stuerman and other campaign-related entities. They also wanted the office to pull emails between two staffers that contained any of 17 search terms (including ""Chalupas"").The investigation followed reporting from the Kansas City Star raising questions about the legality of Greitens’ taxpayer-funded staff working on Greitens’ personal Facebook page.Greitens' general counsel, Lucinda Luetkemeyer, wrote to Martinich-Sauter on June 1 that the office was ""closing the pending records request"" because that was the last day of the Greitens administration.Luetkemeyer said in the same letter, however, that the outgoing administration was forwarding the request to the Parson administration for ""review and processing,"" suggesting the request was not closed. Later in the letter, though, she said that Hawley's office could ""resubmit"" the request if it desired, suggesting the request was closed.
The Post-Dispatch obtained copies of the governor's office Sunshine request log on June 21. It shows the status of Martinich-Sauter's request was marked ""closed"" as of June 1.Compton would not say in June whether the office intended to resubmit its request.She said only in an email that “our office intends to pursue and conclude its investigations in an orderly fashion.”At a campaign stop in St. Charles last week, the newspaper asked Hawley, who is running for U.S. Senate this year, for an update on his investigation. Hawley was also investigating Greitens' potentially illegal use of charity resources.Hawley said that both investigations were ongoing.“We want to make sure that we get the facts, and that we are very thorough,” Hawley said last Wednesday. “And we are going to continue to do that. But they (the investigations) are open.”

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Judge says Missouri gas tax question can stay on ballot,"Aug 14, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/judge-says-missouri-gas-tax-question-can-stay-on-ballot/article_bf63e56a-5a89-5398-b485-d1cdd616f1ad.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • An Osage County judge dismissed a lawsuit Tuesday that sought to block Missouri voters from deciding whether to raise the state’s gasoline tax in November.Associate Circuit Judge Robert Schollmeyer ruled against the lawsuit filed by Rep. Mike Moon, R-Ash Grove, and activist Ron Calzone, who had argued that the Legislature took parliamentary shortcuts in approving a referendum that would phase in a 10-cent increase in the state’s motor fuel tax over four years.Moon had said the referendum violated the Missouri Constitution because the measure’s wording deals with two topics, which is not allowed.

The ballot question, known as Proposition D, was approved in the often-frantic, closing hours of the legislative session in May. With time expiring, lawmakers tacked the gas tax issue onto a bill authorizing a tax deduction for Olympic medals.Schollmeyer, in his 14-page decision, said separate pieces of the legislation fit together under a common title.“(T)he provisions undoubtedly have a natural connection to regulating Missouri’s state revenue stream,” the judge wrote.Attorneys for the state and a coalition of organizations backing the referendum had called on Schollmeyer to be cautious in deciding whether to allow cases such as this to move forward, saying it would be better to decide after voters weigh in.At 17-cents per gallon, Missouri’s motor fuel tax is among the lowest in the nation. Increasing the tax by a dime would place the state’s gas tax above the national average, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
Analysts say the tax could bring in an additional $293 million annually for the state road fund once the full amount has been implemented. The measure also creates a dedicated revenue stream for the Missouri Highway Patrol.Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican, has signaled his support for the increase, saying the state cannot continue delaying a major infrastructure plan.
Construction companies already have contributed more than $300,000 in campaign contributions to a group known as SaferMO.com, which was established to get the measure approved.“SaferMO.com appreciates the court’s clear decision dismissing this baseless attempt to keep Missouri voters from having a say on Proposition D. Our statewide coalition is growing and moving full speed,"" spokesman Scott Charton said.“Businesses across Missouri agree — transportation funding is one of the most important issues facing our state. We need to invest in our infrastructure and use our natural connections to our advantage as we seek to grow our economy,” said Dan Mehan, president and CEO of the Missouri Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Moon and Calzone say they are planning to appeal.“In a time when Missourians are clamoring for checks and balances between the different branches of government, it appears that the legislature is being handed an open checkbook… whatever the legislature wants, the courts will ‘have their backs,'"" Moon said.The legislation is House Bill 1460.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,What do Missouri's Senate candidates think of medical pot and other hot-button ballot items?,"Aug 14, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/what-do-missouri-s-senate-candidates-think-of-medical-pot/article_d42110f7-5e22-5f66-90bd-5b314e9d0bc9.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • When Attorney General Josh Hawley and U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill face each other this November, as many as six high-profile questions will appear on the same ballot as the Senate race.Three groups gathered enough signatures to place three different medical marijuana measures on the ballot. Another group seeks to raise Missouri’s minimum wage to $12 per hour by 2023. Two other questions — one raising the state’s fuel tax and another reforming state ethics laws — will appear if they survive court challenges.















        
            A study in contrast: Josh Hawley and Claire McCaskill

From his days as a law clerk to his private practice, Josh Hawley has focused on cases where religion and the law intersect. Claire McCaskill …






In response to Post-Dispatch questions last week, McCaskill made her positions on the topics known, while Hawley said he was still formulating his opinions.At a campaign stop at a soybean farm in Tebbetts, Mo., on Friday, McCaskill said she would back at least one medical marijuana initiative and support the ethics-reform push backed by the group CLEAN Missouri. She also endorsed the minimum wage hike and the boost to the state’s fuel tax.McCaskill, a Democrat, said she was still studying the three medical marijuana initiatives, and said she was “a little uncomfortable” with the language backed by Springfield attorney and physician, Dr. Brad Bradshaw.“I do think medical marijuana should be passed,” she said.“I think it is time that we make additional investments in our infrastructure,” she said. “And I join our Republican governor and our Republican lieutenant governor in supporting the gas tax.“I certainly think an increase in minimum wage is appropriate,” McCaskill said, “and I couldn’t be more enthusiastic about CLEAN Missouri.”Hawley, a Republican, said he was still studying the proposals when asked about them at a St. Charles campaign stop on Wednesday.“I’m glad they’re on the ballot,” Hawley said when asked about medical marijuana, the gasoline tax and the minimum wage increase. “I think the people should have their say on all of them. I think it’s up to the voters.
“I’m still studying the language on each one of those,” he said, when pressed on his positions. The campaign did not respond to a follow-up question about Hawley’s position on CLEAN Missouri.McCaskill has barbed Hawley for his support of the state’s “right to work” law, which two-thirds of voters rejected last week. By opposing either medical marijuana or a hike to Missouri’s minimum wage, Hawley risks being on the wrong side of public opinion.A Quinnipiac University poll last year found 94 percent of U.S. adults support legalizing marijuana for medicinal purposes. Voters in conservative states such as Florida and Arkansas approved their own programs in 2016.















        
            Medical marijuana backers confident Missourians will get to weigh in this year

Backers of medical marijuana have failed for years to get a question on the ballot.




Missouri voters last approved a minimum wage hike in 2006. Like the right-to-work vote, the state’s conservative electorate has shown support for traditionally Democratic-backed economic policies.McCaskill, on the other hand, could face exposure for her support of increased taxes to pay for road improvements. Missouri voters in 2014 shot down an increase to the state’s sales tax to pay for road improvements.But Republicans — including Gov. Mike Parson and Lt. Gov. Mike Kehoe — have signaled support for this year’s gasoline tax question, saying that Missouri can’t delay a major infrastructure push any longer.Proponents of the gas tax also argue such an increase amounts to a more equitable way to pay for road improvements than the 2014 proposal, saying that those who drive more will inevitably pay more for road upkeep.Though CLEAN Missouri has drawn bipartisan support, a number of Republicans in recent weeks have said that they will oppose the ballot initiative.They argue a provision reforming Missouri’s redistricting process will unfairly leave Missouri with too many Democratic legislative districts following the 2020 U.S. Census. Proponents dispute this.

Thirty-five percent of health care firms and 38 percent of financial firms said they were experiencing a shortage of skilled applicants. That jumped to 61 percent in tech services, where jobs often require industry certifications.Tech firms also stood out when employers were asked what they’re doing about the skill shortage. The top responses in finance and health care included training inexperienced workers and offering higher wages.In technology, firms’ No. 1 answer was that they were hiring from outside the United States. That may become difficult if the government continues to make H-1B visas harder to obtain.The No. 2 answer was more shocking: 42 percent of tech employers selected “none of the above.” In an industry that complains of a severe skill shortage, nearly half of firms aren’t doing anything specific about it.
“This may reflect a reticence by technology-intensive services employers to invest in employee development in a very talent-competitive industry,” the report says.For Hart Nelson, the community college’s associate vice chancellor for workforce solutions, that non-response poses a particular challenge to places such as St. Louis. “It really means these jobs may get created overseas or somewhere else,” he said. “The jobs will go somewhere.”
If tech firms can’t or won’t invest in talent development, the responsibility falls to regional colleges, universities and programs like LaunchCode and Claim Academy. The quality and quantity of their graduates will determine whether St. Louis becomes a leader or an also-ran in the industries of the future.In fact, the report contains a call to action for institutions such as St. Louis Community College. Across the three targeted industries, firms listed “shortage of available training programs” as their third most important barrier to growth, after the skill shortage and “government policies or regulations.”Nelson says his institution is listening. The community college works with employers in various industries to meet their skill needs. It’s building a new health sciences building on the Forest Park campus so it can train more nurses and other medical professionals.The employer partnerships aren’t all at high skill levels. Nelson says conversations with financial services firms led to the creation of a 12-week training program that prepares workers for data-entry or call-center jobs.While St. Louis Community College has been studying workforce issues for a decade — and has highlighted the skill shortage as a top issue for the last four years — others have joined the conversation recently. The Missouri Chamber of Commerce issued a report this spring on the looming shortage of young, skilled workers, and new Missouri Gov. Mike Parson has listed workforce training as a top priority.Talk and action are two different things, however. Missouri’s higher-education budget for this year cuts community college funding by $3.7 million, or 2.6 percent. It’s going to be hard to train the workforce of the future with resources that don’t even keep pace with the past.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Koepka keeps his cool and fends off fierce finish by Tiger,"Aug 13, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/sports/golf/koepka-keeps-his-cool-and-fends-off-fierce-finish-by/article_14f17039-2481-5be0-8ae8-b6a19c3a333e.html,"The eruptions around Bellerive Country Club’s sprawling golf course were impossible to ignore, even for the man atop the leaderboard, the player whose ability to concentrate is matched only by his ability to send golf balls soaring a country mile.So when Tiger Woods continued his birdie hunt around Bellerive’s back nine Sunday, Brooks Koepka did what he does best: He hunkered over the ball and knocked the bejesus out of it.For a while during the final holes of the 100th PGA Championship, Woods’ comeback tour had hit its crescendo as he captured the imagination of thousands of fans around the course, some crammed along the ropes to watch him in person, some stationed at other holes waiting for updates on the manual leaderboards. When Woods birdied, the sound was unmistakable, like a jet engine roaring over the course, echoing through its winding trails.

Knowing his lead was in danger with Woods lurking, not to mention playing partner Adam Scott quietly playing his best golf in years, Koepka stepped onto the 16 green, pulled out his 4 iron for the 248-yard par 3 and thwacked his shot just six feet short of the pin.“That,” Koepka said, “will probably go down as one of the best shots I’ve ever hit under pressure.”The tournament was far from over, but that was essentially Koepka’s kill shot.“It was like a laser,” said caddie Ricky Elliott, still marveling at Koepka’s drive while pulling back a Schlafly Pale Ale. “He had to push the button. He had to make a couple birdies to give himself that cushion.”He did just that. With birdies on 15 and 16 and a clean par finish on 17 and 18, Koepka held off Woods and the rest of the field to capture his third major championship in 14 months. The winner of the last two U.S. Opens added the Wanamaker Trophy to his collection, giving the 28-year-old three of the last seven major titles. Even more impressive, he’s only played in six. Koepka missed parts of four months earlier this season with a wrist injury that some feared could end his career. He missed the Masters in April but has since turned two majors into his personal driving range. Through four days at Bellerive, he averaged 324.2 yards a drive, second-best among the field. He also worked magic with his irons and putted efficiently on the course’s soft greens, but off the tee nobody in contention came close to matching his raw power.With a 4-under 66 on Sunday, Koepka finished the tournament at 16 under. His 72-hole score of 264 was the lowest in PGA Championship history.“I played with him in a practice round and he was literally hitting it 340, 350 in the air,” said Woods, exhausted after his grueling game of chase around the course. “And when a guy’s doing that and hitting it straight and as good a putter as he is, it’s tough to beat.”But so was Woods. For the first time since the 2013 Masters, Woods finished in the top five at a major, going 6 under for the day to finish at 14 under for the tournament. His 64 on Sunday was his lowest final-round score at a major — ever. No, he didn’t capture his 15th major championship, but he didn’t lose the tournament either.Playing in front of thunderous throngs all week, Woods had an even bigger following Sunday inside the ropes, first joined by Missouri Gov. Mike Parson, dressed in Sunday red, just like Woods’ traditional attire. As Woods and playing partner Gary Woodland played the fourth hole, a conspicuous fan joined the watch party: swimming legend Michael Phelps. The 23-time Olympic gold medalist took selfies with fans, chatted up reporters and security officers and, more than anything, watched every drive, wedge and putt as mesmerized as the thousands in the gallery.Coming into Sunday’s final round, Woods had yet to play the back nine under par but needed a low number to climb a stacked leaderboard that included Koepka at the top, followed by Scott and nine more within three strokes, including recent PGA champions Jason Day and Justin Thomas.
Like he had all week, Woods put himself in trouble with his driver, three times on the front nine sending the ball into the crowd. No problem. He saved par on 5 and birdied 8 and 9 to make the turn at 11 under, two off Koepka’s lead.On 11, Woods’ birdie putt kissed the rim of the cup but didn’t fall. He had better luck with birdies on 12, 13 and 15.Woods saved his best moment for last, sinking a 19-foot birdie putt on the 18th green, creating a roar from Bellerive to Belleville. As the ball dropped, Woods gave his most euphoric fist pump of the week, saluted the fans multiple times and walked off feeling good but knowing he’d need a Koepka meltdown to win his first major in a decade.That hardly spoiled his experience in St. Louis.



“I wish we could play in front of crowds like this every single week,” Woods said, “because this is a true pleasure.”Playing two groups back, Koepka heard the eruptions. He never flinched.“You could hear a different roar like every 30 seconds,” he said. “So we knew what was going on. It’s pretty obvious when Tiger makes a birdie. I think everybody at the golf course cheers for him. I’m sure everyone is rooting for him.”“Yeah, I think, other than me, my team, everybody was rooting for Tiger,” he added. “I mean, as they should. He’s the greatest player to ever play the game, and to have the comeback that he’s having is incredible. … I mean, being a part of that as a fan is cool, and even when you’re playing, it’s still pretty neat. It kind of pushes you to step up your game. I mean, you have to because you know he’s right there if you fall.”But Koepka never buckled. Opting for Sunday green instead of red, golf’s Incredible Hulk muscled his way along the back nine while others ahead of him struggled to keep pace. Nine players overall shot at least 10 under — Scott finished third at 13 under, ahead of Stewart Cink and Jon Rahm at 11 for fourth — but as the crowd clearly picked its favorite, Koepka focused on finishing his round. That’s become his specialty. On the PGA Tour since 2014, Koepka’s only won four tournaments. But three have come at the majors, when the stakes and rewards are the highest. How does he focus more on the bigger stages? The man on his bag barely knows.“There’s more stuff going on inside him than you think,” Elliott said, “but he’s able to siphon out everything he doesn’t need and put his energies toward what he does.”Still buzzing over Woods’ finale, the Bellerive crowd offered warm but more subdued applause when Koepka tapped in his final putt, bringing an end to a memorable week for the world’s most famous player, one of the game’s emerging stars and a sports town that shined on golf’s center stage. The newly crowned PGA champion even suggested St. Louis as future Ryder Cup site.“This tournament was great for the fans, especially with the leaderboard that we had,” Koepka said. “Everyone turned out for it. Everyone was there. Everyone is excited. I don’t see a reason why we wouldn’t come back to this area.”

And Tiger Woods thrilled the overflow crowd with a six-under 64 and a fist pump on the 18th green.But Koepka proved unflappable. He finished at 16-under-par for the tournament and won the 100th PGA Championship. He shot 4-under 66 on Sunday and held off Woods by two shots and Scott by three strokes. 

The sun was bright at Bellerive, and temperatures jumped into the 90s. That didn’t deter fans from following Woods and the leading groups in flocks. Spectators stood a dozen rows deep on the ninth hole, and Wood rewarded them by punching in a birdie putt. He gave a fist pump, and the crowd roared.Koepka entered the day at 12-under-par. He birdied three-consecutive holes to end the front nine, and birdied 15 and 16 to put the tournament out of reach.The PGA win marked Koepka's third major. He won the U.S. Open the past two years and is ranked fourth in the world. Big-name fans come to watch WoodsThrongs of fans trailed Tiger Wood at Bellerive, including 28-time Olympic medalist Michael Phelps and Missouri Governor Mike Parson. Woods sits at 11-under through his first nine holes. Brooks Koepka leads at 14-under-par. (last updated 3:45 p.m)Woods starts off decently Tiger Woods birdied two of his first three holes Sunday, but a bogey on six leaves him at 1-under on the day. He is two shots behind leaders Justin Thomas and Brooks Koepka.

LOUIS • The victory of Ferguson city Councilman Wesley Bell in the Democratic primary for St. Louis County prosecutor this week is leading to calls for Bell to reopen the investigation into the shooting death of Michael Brown by a Ferguson police officer in 2014.Those calls have come on social media and elsewhere, including the executive director of the Thurgood Marshall Civil Rights Center in a Washington Post op-ed Friday.Bell spokeswoman Josi Nielsen said that Bell was aware of the requests for a reinvestigation and would address them soon.

“It would be irresponsible for Wesley to comment or take a position on any case prior to seeing all the evidence,” Nielson said in a statement. “Wesley’s platform is focused on transparency, expanding diversionary programs, reforming the cash bail system for nonviolent offenders and ensuring that victims are treated with the respect and dignity they deserve.”Brown’s mother called on Missouri Gov. Mike Parson to reopen the investigation in an online petition last month.In a letter accompanying the petition, Lezley McSpadden-Head said St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch’s office presented a case to the grand jury before the police investigation was over and allowed witnesses to lie to grand jurors. She also faulted the quality of the investigation by police and prosecutors and mentioned a grand juror’s lawsuit seeking to speak about the case.

After growing slowly at first, there were nearly 16,000 signatures Friday afternoon.
Justin Hansford, who is also an associate professor of law at Howard University, says in the op-ed that McCulloch has historically been reluctant to charge police in shootings. He also faulted the investigation. “Brown’s killing remains a gaping wound in the nation’s psyche,” he said.McCulloch and his defenders have long rejected the accusations against him, and pointed to a federal investigation that found that physical evidence and “credible” witnesses supported then-Officer Darren Wilson’s version of the events that led to his shooting of Brown.Also Friday, McSpadden-Head said she planned to run for a seat on the Ferguson City Council.Joel Currier contributed to this report.(tncms-asset)9593241a-9c08-11e8-af7d-00163ec2aa77[1](/tncms-asset)

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Scientists search for 'smoking gun' in the dead zone of Florida's red tide,"Aug 9, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/national/scientists-search-for-smoking-gun-in-the-dead-zone-of/article_f8606a2c-1669-55d2-a9db-d71ee2517d71.html,"On a good day, a beach trip to Sarasota or a boat trip out of Fort Myers can be a sun-kissed adventure filled with relaxation and anticipation.These are not good days.The infamous ""red tide"" has turned southwest Florida into a tragic dead zone with miles of deserted beaches and boatfuls of dread.

The worst toxic algae bloom in recent memory is plaguing paradise and no one has any idea how long it will last and whether this is the new normal.""Back in 1994 we had an outbreak and it killed 196 manatee,"" says Bob Wasno, a marine biologist with Florida Gulf Coast University. ""Everybody was just completely outraged. They yelled and jumped up and down and said 'This is not going to happen again.' Here we are 24 years later and this is worse than ever.""The daily sightings of dead dolphins and lifeless sea turtles, beaches covered in rotting fish and the first recorded loss of a massive whale shark are all the result of a tiny organism known as Karenia brevis. It occurs naturally in saltwater, produces a neurotoxin deadly to most fish and marine mammals and is potentially harmful to humans.But while red tides have broken out in Florida for centuries, scientists believe they may be getting worse after generations of unchecked development, water mismanagement and the new scourge of climate change.""The real question is exactly what role (human) activity is playing on red tides,"" says Dr. Mike Parsons, a red tide expert at Florida Gulf Coast University. ""Between water discharges, our use of agricultural nutrients, the development of Florida and warming seas -- are we poking the bear?""I rode along as Parsons and his colleague, Dr. Bill Mitsch, set out to sample water 20 miles off the coast of Fort Myers.It's where the briny Gulf of Mexico mixes with the fresh water that flows down the Caloosahatchee River from Lake Okeechobee, and Mitsch hopes it will yield an answer. ""I'm looking for the smoking gun,"" he says.
Generations of sugar cane farming has altered the chemistry of Florida's biggest lake and a vast system of dikes and dams built to ""drain the swamp"" and create a retirement wonderland has killed half of the Everglades and put the rest of this vital wetland on life support.In the wet season, Florida dumps massive amounts of Okeechobee's nutrient-rich water into the most delicate ecosystems, while in the dry season, that water is diverted to farms and cities.While this feat of engineering has proven great for the economy, it has been disastrous for the environment, and Mitsch's experiment may prove that America's sugar and farming habits are also making red tides worse. But given the political influence of ""Big Sugar"" over a Republican-led, pro-growth state, even if he finds the smoking gun, he doubts anything will change.""I think the story would be on CNN,"" he tells me. ""It would certainly be in 'Science' magazine, but whether that would translate to any change in politics? I have to say I doubt it. I wish it would. But I think that we need more scientists, different CSI teams who will try to match the pollution source.""
Long the target of environmentalist and sports fishing ire, U.S. Sugar is devoting an entire website to defending its practices. ""We share in the frustration over the Lake Okeechobee discharges,"" the company said.""We want to collaborate in finding solutions that improve water storage and reduce the risk of discharges occurring again. But reckless and mean-spirited attacks -- which are part of their ongoing vendetta against sugarcane farmers -- misdirect the focus away from any meaningful discussion of the facts that will lead us to real solutions. That these radicals are blaming a single company, U.S. Sugar, for systemic regional problems wrought by over 100 years of change is utterly ridiculous.""Off Sanibel Island, we find a pod of dolphins struggling in the toxic waves. As the sea spray kicks the algae into the air, our throats and eyes burn, so it's hard to imagine the agony of the animals around us.On a nearby beach, normally covered with Europeans on August holiday, we find a handful of cleanup workers, raking dead eels and horseshoe crabs from the sand.""Have you seen red tides this bad?"" I ask Thomas Ford, a worker with Crowder Gulf Disaster Management. ""No,"" he shakes his head. ""Who's to blame?"" I ask.""I think we are all to blame to be honest. I think we all play a role in this one way or another. It goes all the way up the chain and all the way down. We just need to come together and let the scientists get to the bottom of it."""

        Rep. Bill White of Joplin, who won the GOP primary for an open Senate seat representing southwestern Missouri, said he did not expect legislative leaders to push for the issue after it was dumped by voters in a bipartisan 67-percent-to-32 percent result.

“I will probably file my right-to-work bill next year, but it is not going to go to the floor,” said White, who favors the measure. “I do not anticipate it moving beyond a committee hearing.”Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican, who had committed to advocating for the law when he took office June 1, was silent Wednesday on whether he would push for the Legislature to make another run at the measure.














        
            Missouri Senate race sets up as proxy battle on Trump



In his first statement on the crushing outcome, issued 22 hours after the polls closed, Parson said, “Last night, the people of Missouri voiced their opinion on Proposition A. However, I am still absolutely optimistic about the future of Missouri and convinced that there are significant and exciting opportunities to come.”Parson pledged to work across party lines to bring economic growth to the state on infrastructure and workforce development — “areas that I firmly believe we can find common ground to make lasting impacts for future generations of Missourians.”The 32nd Senate district in southwestern Missouri was among the few bright spots for supporters of the initiative, which asked whether the Show-Me State wanted to join 27 others in allowing private-sector workers to not pay dues to a labor organization.In that corner of the state, a majority of voters in eight counties bordering Arkansas and Oklahoma — both right-to-work states — favored the referendum. The state’s two most southern counties, Pemiscot and Dunklin, both bordering Arkansas, also supported the law.














        
            Bell win credited to mix of grassroots work, Ferguson and McCulloch missteps



In all, just 15 of the state’s 114 counties supported the measure, called Proposition A.White has been an ardent supporter of right to work, which business groups argue will help draw more companies and jobs to Missouri. Since he was elected to the House, he has filed a right-to-work bill in seven consecutive legislative sessions.Now, however, he said it could be years before a serious push was made to get it into law.“I think that is the likely course of events,” White told the Post-Dispatch.A post-election review shows the proposition was deeply unpopular not only with Democrats but also with Republicans.Based on a comparison of voting in the U.S. Senate primary races and Proposition A, an estimated 50 percent of GOP voters cast ballots that said “no” to the right-to-work law.














        
            Despite Stenger's victory, conflict with the St. Louis County Council still looms




Unofficial tallies show 605,503 Democrats voted in the Senate Democratic primary, while 663,553 Republicans voted in the GOP primary. Yet, the number of “no” votes cast for the proposition zoomed to 937,241.Assuming the vast majority or all Democrats voted “no,” as many as 331,000 Republicans bolted from their party on the issue.The proposition also may have contributed to a surge in voter turnout. Unofficial totals show that about 33.5 percent of the roughly 4.1 million registered voters in the state cast a ballot. By contrast, turnout in the previous two primary elections was about 25 percent.That turnout may have been fueled by massive spending by labor unions, who say right to work hurts the middle class by lowering wages. Supporters of the proposition acknowledged Tuesday they had been outworked.“Unfortunately, the unions used their massive cash advantage to drown out our positive economic message,” said Missouri Chamber of Commerce and Industry chief Dan Mehan.Rep. Holly Rehder, R-Sikeston, a vocal backer of right to work, said she was committed to keeping the issue alive.

“This fight is not going away, and I look forward continuing to push for labor reform,” said Rehder, who did not offer a timeline on when the issue might again come up in the Legislature. Voters in her southeastern Missouri district rejected the proposal.Rep. Bart Korman, R-High Hill, who voted against the law, said supporters should take a breather.“My advice would be to listen to the vote of the people and probably set that aside for a while. At this point, the vote speaks pretty soundly,” said Korman, who is term-limited and not seeking re-election.Korman’s district includes Warren County, which is home to some of the 4,000 union employees at the General Motors assembly in nearby Wentzville. Voters there shot down the issue, 72 percent to 28 percent.Rep. Kathie Conway, a term-limited St. Charles Republican who also voted “no” on right to work in the Legislature, said it would not be wise for Republicans to bring up the issue when lawmakers reconvene in January.“In my humble opinion, next year’s not the time to bring this up again,” Conway said. “It’s a huge distraction, and we have a presidential election in 2020. I think that it kind of sucks all the oxygen out of the room for other issues.”Conway said Republicans “shot themselves in the foot” by moving the referendum to August from November.They took “three months of educational time away from themselves,” Conway said.In St. Charles County, traditionally a GOP bastion, 68 percent of voters cast ballots in favor of scrapping the law.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Messenger: After long battle to change Missouri law, hair-braiders still being blocked by state","Aug 8, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/columns/tony-messenger/messenger-after-long-battle-to-change-missouri-law-hair-braiders/article_c84cedfa-4fc0-5788-8f24-af3dae2891f1.html,"Shamed Dogan remembers the stark divide in the House hearing room earlier this year when he was trying to pass a bill that would remove onerous and expensive regulations from those who practice the art of African-style hair braiding.On one side were mostly black women, many of them immigrants, who want to start their own businesses braiding, weaving and twisting hair into various styles without the use of dyes, chemicals or heat.On the other side were mostly white women, owners of cosmetology schools, that charge thousands of dollars for more than 1,000 hours of education the state was requiring before hair-braiders could practice legally, even though the schools don’t actually teach anything about hair braiding.

The room perfectly painted a picture of the issue, says Dogan, a Republican state representative from Ballwin.













Rep. Shamed Dogan, R-Ballwin


For four years he had been unsuccessful in trying to decrease regulations on hair-braiders, as had other black politicians before him, including Democratic state Sen. Jamilah Nasheed.It’s an issue in which race and money intertwine.But this year, Dogan’s bill passed with wide, bipartisan support. It was signed by the governor.This week, Dogan found out the cosmetology cartel was still standing in the way, and Attorney General Josh Hawley appears to be giving them cover.The new law says that hair-braiders can become registered with the state by paying a $20 fee. They are required to watch a four- to six-hour video about infection control and diseases of the scalp. But the Board of Cosmetology and Barber Examiners — which is controlled by industry appointments — has refused to make the video.“That just seems ridiculous,” Dogan says. “We provided ample funding in the budget.”The board’s refusal to produce the video is having a ripple effect that could land before the U.S. Supreme Court. In 2014, lawyers Dan Alban of the Virginia-based nonprofit Institute for Justice and Jerry Hunter of Bryan Cave in St. Louis filed a lawsuit in federal court on behalf of two local hair-braiders, Tameka Stigers of St. Louis and Ndioba Niang of Florissant. The lawsuit seeks to declare Missouri’s cosmetology and barber licensing laws unconstitutional because they, in effect, block hair-braiders from the profession of their choice.Similar lawsuits had been successful in several other states.But Missouri’s law was upheld.
After two appeals, that lawsuit was scheduled to be considered by the U.S. Supreme Court later this year, but because the Legislature changed the law, Alban was prepared to ask the court to declare the lawsuit moot.“The law they sued under has changed,” he says.He found out this week, however, that Hawley’s office doesn’t see things the same way, in part because the Board of Cosmetology is refusing to prepare to carry out the new law.“It is completely crazy,” Alban says. The board is “in complete defiance of what the Legislature did. It’s quite shocking to me.”
Mary Compton, a spokeswoman for Hawley, says the attorney general supports the new law and “encourages the board to implement it promptly.” But until that happens, Hawley has to defend the old law, she says.“Until the Board of Cosmetology implements the new law,” Compton said in a statement, “the plaintiffs’ challenge to the old law is not moot and the attorney general’s office is obligated to defend it.”Alban says he believes Hawley — who on Tuesday won the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate — has “an obligation to enforce the law.”The situation leaves businesswomen like Stigers in limbo — and a certain amount of fear.Before she sued, the cosmetology board had investigated or brought legal action against 18 separate hair-braiders for operating without proper licensing.Now, Stigers fears she won’t be able to get licensed come Aug. 28, because the Board of Cosmetology isn’t prepared to implement the new law. Meanwhile, the attorney general is still defending the old law.“It’s very disheartening,” Stigers says.She operates a hair-braiding business on Delmar Boulevard called Locs of Glory. A few weeks ago, she called the cosmetology board to find out if it was prepared to implement the new law on Aug. 28 when it goes into effect. She hoped to be among the first to become properly licensed, but she was told the new law was under review.A spokesman for Gov. Mike Parson said the governor also is supportive of the new law and is “evaluating the board and considering appointments.”“We’re creating this lane,” Stigers says of her fellow African-American businesswomen, “and there’s so much opposition. It’s like they’re telling us, ‘You thought you won, but we’re going to get the last laugh.’”

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Fate of proposed gas tax hike in Missouri could be decided next week,"Aug 7, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/fate-of-proposed-gas-tax-hike-in-missouri-could-be/article_a29f5feb-25c2-502c-b5e4-05d8a534476c.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • A judge could decide as early as next week to let a lawsuit go forward challenging whether Missouri voters can hike the state’s gasoline tax in November.Associate Circuit Judge Robert Schollmeyer heard arguments Tuesday over a lawsuit filed by Rep. Mike Moon, R-Ash Grove, that seeks to block a referendum from going on the general election ballot that would phase in a 10-cent increase in the state’s motor fuel tax.Moon argues that the referendum violates the Missouri Constitution because the measure’s wording deals with two topics, which is not allowed.

Legislators approved the referendum in the closing hours of this year’s legislative session, tacking the gas tax issue onto a bill authorizing a tax deduction for Olympic medals.Moon also argues that the Olympic medals bill was an “improper vehicle” for a referendum. Referendums go straight to the ballot; bills go to the governor’s desk.“They passed a bill using unconstitutional, illegal procedures,” said Ron Calzone, who filed the suit with Moon.But attorneys for the state and a coalition of organizations backing the referendum said judges should be cautious in deciding whether to allow cases such as this to move forward.“The Missouri Supreme Court repeatedly has made it clear that courts should be reluctant to review the constitutionality of ballot measures before an election,” the attorney general’s office said in its response.Assistant Attorney General Jason Lewis said the court should wait until the election is over to intervene.“At this point, it is too early to tell what will happen,” Lewis said.
Missouri’s gasoline tax is among the lowest in the nation. But increasing the tax by a dime would place the state’s fuel tax above the national average, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.Analysts say the tax could bring in an additional $293 million annually for the state road fund once the full amount has been implemented.Construction companies already have funneled nearly $300,000 in campaign contributions to a fund set up to get the measure, known as Proposition D, approved.“Our campaign is going strong and we are building a statewide coalition. We are confident that the courts will let voters decide on making Missouri roads and streets safer and restoring MoDOT’s purchasing power for projects. And we will be working over the next three months to make the case for Prop D, and we are confident that Missouri citizens will vote Yes on Prop D,” said Scott Charton, a spokesman for SaferMo.com.
Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican, has signaled his support for the increase, saying the state cannot continue delaying a major infrastructure plan.Calzone said Schollmeyer should weigh in, even if it is merely to clarify how the Legislature can draft bills.“They need a common-sense test,” Calzone said.Schollmeyer asked Lewis whether this might be an instance in which judicial action is warranted.“Isn’t this the perfect situation for checks and balances?” he said.The legislation is House Bill 1460.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,'Opening Day' for the PGA — St. Louis style,"Aug 7, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/sports/golf/opening-day-for-the-pga-st-louis-style/article_454814e5-e887-55fe-a505-c191ae9d69da.html,"Ozzie Smith, riding an eight-horse hitch of Clydesdales pulling a Budweiser beer wagon, delivering the event’s championship trophy to the PGA Championship at Bellerive Country Club on Monday was about the most St. Louis way possible to kick off the tournament week. All that was missing was some toasted ravioli or a concrete from Ted Drewes.While golfers had been out on the course all morning, and the tournament itself doesn’t begin until Thursday, the arrival of the trophy in some ways marked the beginning of the festivities at Bellerive, which was swarming with golf fans on a painfully muggy day as many in the field played practice rounds or took to the driving range.In fact, in the eyes of tournament organizers, this was Opening Day — capital O, capital D — a concept that in baseball parlance carries to many in St. Louis the same impact as, say, Christmas.

“Five years ago, when we had the senior championship here, we talked about this day and what it would mean to this area,” said Smith, wearing a replica ’82 Cardinals jersey with “O. Smith” on the back.“The financial windfall from something like this is very, very important for the whole area. The whole area will benefit from something like this, and to land something like this … think about it. The 100th PGA Championship. It’s only going to happen once. The PGA Championship in St. Louis, Missouri. Who’d have thought?”When the Clydesdales pulled up in front of Bellerive’s Jeffersonian-inspired clubhouse, which up until a few minutes before had seen competitors pulling up in their courtesy cars, Smith passed the Wanamaker Trophy — one of the few sports trophies referred to by name — to Mike DeCola, the championship chair for the tournament, and PGA Secretary Jim Richerson, who ceremonially placed it on a stand on the grass in the center of the drive in front of the clubhouse. (It was moved inside shortly afterward and will reside most of the time in a room inside the clubhouse, though it will be brought outside from time to time.)Some fans stopped their golf-watching to take in the event, and more called out for Smith to come over to sign autographs than those who asked for Gov. Mike Parson.“We were trying really hard to make this as much of a local flavor as we could,” said DeCola, CEO of Clayton-based HBM Holdings. “We’re calling today Opening Day because of how many baseball fans we have. You couldn’t have anything more iconic for St. Louis than to have the Clydesdales bring the Wanamaker Trophy in. It was an inspired act of genius by Barry Deach, the tournament director, and having Ozzie bring it in was icing on the cake.”
Smith had added significance for the tournament because he’s been more than just an unofficial ambassador . Through his involvement as president of the Gateway chapter of PGA Reach, the charitable organization that was part of Bellerive’s bid for the event, Smith has been part of the event from just about the beginning and has made multiple appearances on its behalf.“Ozzie has been so involved in helping us bring this event to St. Louis,” DeCola said. “He was an integral part of what we’re doing locally though the Gateway PGA Reach Foundation. It was really funny when he started to get involved, which predates our involvement as a club. Ozzie said I don’t want to be a figurehead, I want to be involved, so his engagement with the process is deep and genuine. It’s really neat.”



“Something like this doesn’t happen without the support of the whole community,” Smith said. “So we were able to pull it all together and, look at this place. It doesn’t even look like the same place. So I’m excited for the area, excited for the chance to come out here this week and experience it firsthand. I’ve gone to Ryder Cups and stuff like that, but to have something like this in your backyard, it’s very, very special. We’ve got some of the best golfers in the world right here.”By the time the trophy arrived, Opening Day was well underway. DeCola got to Bellerive at 6:30 a.m. and there was already activity. “The gates didn’t open until 7, but there were already people flowing through,” he said. “It’s so cool because this is the fun part, putting the show on for the public. We’re thrilled about it. I know the golfers are really excited to be doing this. I know the course is in great shape. Local communities have done a great job of coordinating traffic flow and security. It’s very, very cool.”The name Tiger Woods has popped up often as Smith has talked about the tournament, but, he said, the tournament will likely be decided on Bellerive’s greens.“It boils down to who putts well one week,” Smith said. “You just have to have that one week where that ball goes in the hole. We’ll see who that’s going to be. I don’t know who that’s going to be. Justin Thomas just won, he seems to be on a roll right now. You never know. These greens could trick him.”

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"With his signature achievement on the line, former Gov. Greitens cannot vote","Aug 7, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/with-his-signature-achievement-on-the-line-former-gov-greitens/article_7c525400-91aa-598a-a254-6cef5a1f4a8a.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • One of former Gov. Eric Greitens’ signature achievements during his short, scandal-plagued career was putting his signature on a “right to work” law.But now that the law is being challenged at the ballot box Tuesday thanks to a successful petition drive by labor unions, Greitens cannot cast a vote to keep the law in place.According to a review of voting records, Greitens is still registered to vote at the Governor’s Mansion in the capital city. There are no records indicating he has switched his registration to Warren County, where he and his wife, Sheena, own a home in the resort community of Innsbrook.

• Research your ballot for the Aug. 7 primaryThat means someone like Greitens can’t vote Tuesday, according to the Secretary of State’s office.“The voter must register in the correct jurisdiction, so they would have needed to register in Warren County. If their registration is still in Cole County, then they did not register in Warren,” said spokeswoman Maura Browning.Missouri voters who move to another county must re-register to vote. The deadline for that was July 11, according to Ashcroft’s office.
“People moving from one election jurisdiction to another prior to the registration deadline who fail to register to vote by the registration deadline will not be able to vote in that particular election,” the Secretary of State’s website notes.
Greitens left office June 1 under a cloud of scandal, including a now-dismissed felony charge for invasion of privacy against a woman and numerous campaign fundraising irregularities.Since quitting, it is unclear what the author and motivational speaker has been doing. Attempts to contact him have been unsuccessful.In addition to signing the right-to-work law, Greitens also pledged to campaign for its passage when it was placed on the ballot. A nonprofit formed to push Greitens’ agenda gave supporters of the law $500,000 to help promote a “yes” vote on the ballot.The organization, known as A New Missouri, can shield its donors’ identities, so the ultimate source of the money is not known.Greitens’ successor, Gov. Mike Parson, voted absentee in Polk County, where he is registered, said spokesman Steele Shippy.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Harris-Stowe serves as a great host for national group,"Aug 6, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/mailbag/harris-stowe-serves-as-a-great-host-for-national-group/article_f00d78a8-3e03-5f46-ac5d-5753e4f75348.html,"You might think that an institution that generates $6 of value for every $1 it receives from the state, attracts national investment, and has been a pillar of the St. Louis community for 162 years would garner some support from Jefferson City. Unfortunately, you’d be wrong.Harris-Stowe State University is Missouri’s lowest-funded state college. So, as a director of a national organization that just held its national conference at Harris-Stowe, I was disturbed when Gov. Mike Parson cut the already underfunded school’s budget by $500,000, a significant chunk of its $9 million allocation.When my organization, the New Economy Coalition, was looking for a location for our 2018 conference, St. Louis stood out as a great option. Our challenge was that we needed to find a venue that had the capacity to host such a large event but that also aligned with our values. Fortunately, our partners at Solidarity Economy St. Louis ensured us that Harris-Stowe could deliver on all fronts.

In the week that we spent in St. Louis, Harris-Stowe staff, faculty and students went above and beyond, with some of them essentially on call 24/7. They were amazing hosts but were clearly stretched thin.
Its role as a destination for national conventions like ours surely contributes to Harris-Stowe’s economic impact of $65 million per year on the St. Louis region. Harris-Stowe’s role as an educator, however, is far more important. Ninety percent of Harris-Stowe students are Pell Grant-eligible, and Harris-Stowe graduates earn 70 percent more than their peers who only receive a high school diploma.Gov. Parson promised to prevent wasteful government spending and promote economic growth. When it comes to stimulating the economy, he would be hard-pressed to find a better use of tax dollars than investing in Harris-Stowe.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"20 years after former St. Louis reporter's murder, panel reviewing convicted killer's fate will convene","Aug 6, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/years-after-former-st-louis-reporter-s-murder-panel-reviewing/article_7943eafc-7a75-5fb3-a909-6aa03c6e7e95.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • A special panel formed to review the death penalty case of Marcellus Williams will convene later this month after being in limbo following the abrupt resignation of former Gov. Eric Greitens.Retired U.S. District Judge Carol Jackson told the Post-Dispatch Monday that Gov. Mike Parson gave the panel of five former judges the green light to proceed with the review of Williams, who was sentenced to death in connection with the 1998 murder of former Post-Dispatch reporter and University City resident Lisha Gayle.Williams was hours from being executed last August when Greitens stopped the process and invoked a rarely used state law to appoint a special board to review the case and recommend life or death.

That panel had been scheduled to meet in June, but Greitens’ departure left the members unsure of their authority.But, after a top Parson staffer called her, Jackson said the members agreed to meet Aug. 22 to hear from attorneys involved in the case.“We’re going to move forward,” Jackson said.Each side will get 30 minutes to present an overview of the case.
The Aug. 22 date is significant because it marks the one-year anniversary of Greitens’ decision to halt the execution.Williams was convicted in 2001 of murdering Gayle at her home in University City. Prosecutors said Williams was burglarizing the home when Gayle, who had been taking a shower, surprised him. Gayle, who left the paper in 1992, fought for her life as she was stabbed repeatedly.The Missouri Supreme Court in 2015 postponed Williams’ execution to allow time for the DNA tests. Using technology that was not available at the time of the killing, those tests show that DNA found on the knife matched that of an unknown male. Williams’ DNA was not found on the knife.
Despite that finding, the state’s high court denied his petition to stop the execution and either appoint a special master to hear his innocence claim or vacate the death sentence and order his sentence commuted to life in prison.The panel has met twice since it was formed. The first meeting was held in November, when the jurists received transcripts of Williams’ trial, information on DNA testing that was done in 2016 and other background information on Williams’ case, including opinions from various state and federal appeals.The second meeting came in March.Members of the panel are Jackson, former 22nd Circuit Judge Michael David, former Circuit Judge Peggy Fenner of Jackson County, former Missouri Court of Appeals Western District Judge Paul Spinden and former Circuit Judge Ellen Roper of Boone County.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri Governor's Mansion needs millions in repairs,"Aug 5, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-governor-s-mansion-needs-millions-in-repairs/article_69ee45ad-5e14-54e1-975e-fe807b0dce01.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • The Missouri Governor’s Mansion is in nowhere near the tattered condition that forced a two-year, $15 million rehab of its counterpart in Illinois.But documents show the 146-year-old house here needs some pricey repairs.According to a briefing paper produced when former Gov. Eric Greitens was elected in 2016, the mansion needs up to $4.3 million in repairs, including replacement of columns on the home’s sun porch, electrical upgrades and replacement of the heating and cooling system.

At the time, the document obtained by the Post-Dispatch said the repairs could be made in one year if the governor and his family were to live somewhere else.“By delaying occupancy, this ensures the least disruption to the family, given the complexity of some of these projects,” the briefing paper, written by the administration of Greitens’ predecessor, Jay Nixon, says.But neither Greitens nor his successor, Gov. Mike Parson, vacated the premises in order to keep the condition of the residence from further deterioration.

And, according to the Office of Administration, which oversees building repairs in the Capitol complex, there are no plans to move the governor and first lady out of the home anytime soon.The three-story brick building was first occupied by Gov. Benjamin Gratz Brown in 1872. The first floor includes a 17-foot-high Great Hall, two parlors, a library and a divided dining room. It has 13 bedrooms on the second and third floors.In Illinois, years of decay forced the temporary closure of space within the Governor’s Mansion over the course of several years. Leaks in the roof damaged upstairs bedrooms. Flooding in the basement damaged items that were in storage.














        
            Illinois Governor's Mansion reopens after $15 million renovation



In early 2015, Gov. Bruce Rauner announced he was raising money from private sources to pay for upgrades to the building, which had not undergone major renovations since the 1970s.Repairs and upgrades included installing a new roof, HVAC system and entrance. Work also was done to ensure the mansion complies with the Americans with Disabilities Act.
The mansion reopened to the public in mid-July.Rauner and his wife, Diana, lived in a house on the Illinois State Fairgrounds during the $15 million project.In Missouri, some work on the mansion was done while Greitens and then Parson resided in the building. Unlike Illinois, the money paying for the repairs is not from private sources, but from a bond issue the state conducted in 2014. Parson was the sponsor of the legislation.Office of Administration spokeswoman Brittany Ruess said the state paid $252,000 to install boilers in the basement. The previous boilers had been hooked into the Capitol’s antiquated steam heat loop. The original estimate, according to the document, put the cost at $200,000.Other projects are in the works, including the possible replacement of the sun porch columns and windows, replacement of the heating and air conditioning system and replacement of the underground sewer piping in the basement.

“Once the designer has completed the design, the state will have a construction schedule finalized as part of this effort,” Ruess said.But there are no plans for Parson to move out after taking office June 1 to replace Greitens, who resigned.“There have been no logistical discussions at this time,” Ruess said. “Every effort is being made to keep the first family comfortably within the residence while repairs are being made.”How long that might last remains unclear.According to the briefing paper, the interior plaster, paint and flooring of the mansion need to be repaired at an estimated cost of $500,000.“This is a necessary project as the interior plaster on the first floor is flaking and falling,” the document says. “In addition, the existing paint is lead-based and would require a hazardous remediation project. While this work would be occurring, it would be necessary for the family to not be in the residence.”In a statement, Ruess said, “Despite the challenges, these repairs are imperative to preserving the Governor’s Mansion for years to come and we are looking forward to making these repairs so the Mansion can continue to be enjoyed by many.”

Parson blocks Missourians from accessing health care,"Aug 1, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/mailbag/gov-parson-blocks-missourians-from-accessing-health-care/article_1b78afd0-8c99-5fd3-93eb-1eebc80d3874.html,"Gov. Mike Parson has signed two measures to block thousands of Missouri patients from accessing preventive health care from Planned Parenthood centers across the state.According to the new budget he signed, Medicaid reimbursements for health care providers who also provide abortions are now banned. With this bill, more than 7,000 low-income youth, pregnant women, adults, seniors and people with disabilities in Missouri can no longer use Medicaid to access preventive health care services at Planned Parenthood because Gov. Parson believes in his right to control your body.

Gov. Parson's defunding of Planned Parenthood will hurt the St. Louis community. His work serves to undo the sacrifices we have made over the past 30 years to bring accessible and affordable health care to the St. Louis area.
In 1993, St. Louis recorded 870 new HIV cases. In 2014, we hit a new low of 224 new HIV cases, in part because of the efforts Planned Parenthood has made with the larger public health community.
This ban only blocks access to preventive services Planned Parenthood provides, which include birth control access/education, pregnancy testing, cancer and HIV screening, because there is already a prohibition on using federal money to fund abortions. It was already law that Medicaid reimbursements could only cover these other critical services Planned Parenthood provides for our community in order to keep our people healthy. Now Gov. Parson wants to stop us from taking care of our health.Sid Rana  •  Chesterfield"
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Pardon sought for Missouri protester who got 8-year sentence,"Jul 31, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/pardon-sought-for-missouri-protester-who-got--year-sentence/article_f36b2014-1e93-521f-8a40-ed4965308aa1.html,"ST. LOUIS • A Missouri legislator is asking the governor to pardon a man who was sentenced to eight years in prison for starting a fire at a store during a protest over a fatal officer-involved shooting.State Rep. Bruce Franks Jr., D-St. Louis, said Tuesday that the prison sentence given to Joshua Williams was “harsh.” A spokeswoman for Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican, said he was traveling and wasn’t immediately available for comment.

Williams and Franks are both black and were frequent protesters in Ferguson after 18-year-old Michael Brown, who was black and unarmed, was fatally shot by white officer Darren Wilson in August 2014. Wilson was not charged and later resigned, but the shooting led to months of demonstrations.In December 2014, a police officer fatally shot 18-year-old Antonio Martin in Berkeley, just a few miles from Ferguson, setting off another protest. Martin was black, and the officer who shot him was white. Berkeley police said an investigation determined that Martin pointed a gun at the officer, who was not charged.

Police said Williams, 19 at the time, took items from a QuikTrip convenience store near the shooting site after looters shattered its glass doors, and used lighter fluid to set a fire. The fire was quickly extinguished and damage was minimal, but the crime was captured on video.Williams pleaded guilty to arson, burglary and theft. Prosecutors sought 15 years in prison; Williams’ attorney asked for a suspended sentence.Franks said Williams had no prior record and others convicted of similar crimes during protests received much more lenient sentences.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"From drinking water to farms, drought's effect creeping across Missouri","Jul 27, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/from-drinking-water-to-farms-drought-s-effect-creeping-across/article_35440d14-a1c4-5f86-ac64-b5b63906fe57.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • As a light rain fell on Missouri’s capital city Thursday, a task force assembled to assess the state’s drought met for the first time.“It’s a little ironic that we convened this meeting in the middle of a rainstorm. But don’t let it deceive you,” Missouri Department of Natural Resources Director Carol Comer told more than three dozen in attendance.Fifty-two of Missouri’s 114 counties are now affected by the lingering lack of precipitation, up from 47 last week when Gov. Mike Parson activated the panel to monitor the drought. Eleven counties have slipped into a more extreme category of drought since July 19.

In all, nearly 2.6 million people live in drought-affected areas.The most updated drought map, released Thursday, places St. Charles County and a swath of southwestern St. Louis County within the abnormally dry category.Other warning signs are in Franklin County, where groundwater well levels have fallen off, said National Weather Service hydrologist Mark Fuchs.“In just a week we’ve had quite an expansion of extreme drought,” said Jennifer Hoggatt, of the Department of Natural Resources’ Missouri Water Resources Center.Although it’s early in the assessment, Rob Kallenbach of the University of Missouri Extension service said the drought has already cost the state’s agriculture industry an estimated $2 billion.And, Kallenbach said, that number is growing.For farmers, especially those in the hard-hit northwest part of the state, the drought has raised red flags about having adequate feed for cattle.“Our hay yield’s about half of where we usually are,” Kallenbach said.The state has already granted a statewide variance that allows grazing on land that would normally not provide grazing.Missouri also has earmarked $2 million to help farmers plant cover crops to improve feed and forage and other natural resources.
Kallenbach said more farmers are turning to harvesting drought-damaged corn to feed to their herds.Colleen Meredith, soil and water conservation director for DNR, said the state is considering a plan to ease regulations on farmers in order to streamline the process for digging wells.The drought has affected public water systems near Kansas City and northwestern Missouri, said David Lamb of DNR’s public drinking water division.
In Hamilton, low water levels in the reservoir that supplies nearly 2,500 customers has triggered conservation measures and forced officials to begin seeking options to acquire more water.Officials in Cameron, near St. Joseph, have gotten permission to temporarily draw from Pony Express Lake in order to shore up their supplies for 10,000 customers.Fuchs said there is some rain in the forecast in the next week, but it won’t be enough to keep the entire state from being under a drought by October.“There’s some hope there for the state, but not necessarily where we need it the most,” Fuchs said.State officials have been watching the situation since winter, when warning signs about problems in the northwest part of the state began to surface.By mid-July, the committee felt the parched conditions warranted governmental involvement, sparking the governor’s executive order.The committee includes members from the Department of Natural Resources, the U.S. Forest Service, University of Missouri, the Department of Agriculture and other state, federal and local agencies.State climatologist Pat Guinan said this drought rivals the 2012 drought, with rainfall totals 12 to 15 inches below normal in some counties, representing a 56 percent decrease in precipitation.“They are approaching records, when we have records going back 150 years,” Guinan said.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,President Trump touts tariffs at Granite City steel plant,"Jul 27, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/business/local/president-trump-touts-tariffs-at-granite-city-steel-plant/article_064757ce-044e-5fec-bd00-5f1eb5a1be5c.html,"President Donald Trump touched down at St. Louis Lambert International Airport on Thursday afternoon as part of a swing through the Midwest that included U.S. Steel’s Granite City Works, where he lauded a positive impact from the tariffs he imposed on imported steel.Greeting him on the runway were Missouri Gov. Mike Parson, on the job for just under two months after the resignation of Gov. Eric Greitens, and newly appointed Lt. Gov. Mike Kehoe. It was Trump’s third time visiting the St. Louis region over the last year. He visited Boeing’s St. Louis County factory in March and held a rally in St. Charles in November to whip up support for the tax cuts that Congress passed last year.RELATED: Watch videos from President Trump’s visit to Granite City

Flanked by his daughter, Ivanka Trump, the president took a brief tour of the Granite City steel plant, humming again after the restart of a steelmaking blast furnace following Trump’s tariff announcement in February. For decades the economic engine of the Metro East suburb, the factory is in the process of restarting its second blast furnace, which is expected to be online by October and bring the worker count there back to some 1,500 people.“Thanks to our tariffs, idle factories throughout our nations are roaring back to life,” Trump told an enthusiastic crowd of about 500 supporters in a warehouse on the Granite City Works campus.As the motorcade made its way through town, the streets were lined with mostly supporters holding signs saying “thank you” and “MAGA,” short for Trump’s campaign slogan “Make America Great Again.” One child held a sign that said “You steel our” hearts.Repeating his refrain that other countries have taken advantage of American wealth and workers, Trump said that before his election the United States was “the big, dumb piggy bank” that “everybody was robbing.”“We have the worst trade deals ever made in history. But now, they’re becoming good again. We are here today because America never surrenders,” he said.

        In a speech that strayed from steelmaking to touch on North Korea, Russia, “fake news,” the upcoming release of gross domestic product estimates and agriculture, Trump pledged that he would continue to support the steel industry for national security reasons.“This is steel and we’re watching this one closely, and it’s going up, Dave, only up,” he told U.S. Steel CEO David Burritt, who joined the president on stage during his speech.But not all steelworkers were excited by the president’s visit. Steelworker Mike Dickinson was among a group protesting Trump on Thursday.“I would be in support of tariffs. But I can’t be in support of Trump because all the other issues kind of outweigh the tariffs,” he said, citing the president’s environmental policies and his nominations to the U.S. Supreme Court. A small group of protesters in Granite City chanted “traitor” as the motorcade passed.

        Though the visit was official — meaning taxpayer dollars paid for it — Trump’s speech often seemed more like a campaign rally. Illinois Republicans facing challengers accompanied him, and he openly asked the crowd to vote Republican and criticized Democrats.Trump was joined at the plant by Rep. Mike Bost, R-Murphysboro, whose district includes the Granite City Works and who has expressed support for the steel tariffs. He is facing a spirited challenge for his congressional seat from Democratic St. Clair County State’s Attorney Brendan Kelly. The United Steelworkers, the union that represents Granite City steelworkers, released a statement Thursday reaffirming their support for Kelly over Bost. Kelly planned a rally of his own Thursday evening with organized labor.Also joining Trump was Rep. John Shimkus, R-Collinsville, and Rep. Rodney Davis, R-Taylorville, whose districts encompass some of the Metro East. Both are also facing November challengers.

Absent was Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner, a Republican who has largely distanced himself from the Trump administration during his first term as chief executive. He said he had traveled just a week ago to Granite City, where he vetoed legislation that would have required the city’s mayor be named to a local flood control agency.U.S. Steel idled the Granite City Works in December 2015 in the face of low steel prices and plummeting demand from customers in the domestic shale drilling business. Worker counts dipped as low as 100 people at the plant that a few years ago employed roughly 2,000. Activity had picked back up by 2017, with some 700 to 800 people using other facilities to finish raw steel made elsewhere.But it was Trump’s tariffs that Pittsburgh-based U.S. Steel said helped it decide to again start making raw steel at the sprawling factory seven miles northeast of downtown St. Louis.

Post-Dispatch




While Trump seeks to highlight a success story from his use of tariffs to reshape the country’s trade relationships with both allies such as Europe and Canada and competitors such as China, Midwest farmers only a few dozen miles away are increasingly anxious about losing access to markets for their soybeans, corn, pork and other products. U.S. farmers have been one of the larger beneficiaries of the free trade policies that defined the world order over the last 30 years, but retaliatory duties from enormous markets like China have put their crops at a disadvantage to foreign competitors. Commodity prices had already been declining in recent years, squeezing farm income.Signaling a desire to calm those fears a few months before midterm elections where farm state Republicans need to retain seats to maintain the party’s hold on Congress, the Trump administration this week announced a $12 billion commodity price support plan under a Depression-era law to make direct farm payments. Farm groups responded tepidly.“For farmers who will be renegotiating their line of credit for the coming year, it’s welcome news but no substitute for the ability to sell what we produce overseas freely,” Missouri Farm Bureau President Blake Hurst, who farms corn and soy in northwest Missouri, told the Post-Dispatch on Wednesday. “It certainly implies these trade disputes will be going on for several months if not years, and that’s not good news for American agriculture. Farmers need to see some progress with our ongoing disputes with the rest of the world.”

Some of that progress appeared just a few hours later Wednesday, when Trump, standing alongside European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker in the Rose Garden, announced they had agreed to hold off on any new tariffs and work to resolve disputes on Trump’s steel and aluminum tariffs. Juncker also said the EU would import more American soybeans.But many observers in Europe considered the moves as symbolic as the EU does not impose tariffs on soybean imports, limiting the impact on the futures market. Soy futures held steady Thursday, with Chicago Board of Trade November soybean futures rising ¼-cent to close at $8.76 a bushel.But overall, prices have declined on worries over trade disputes. Hurst said Chinese importers are turning to Brazil and Argentina for soybean imports and offering less to American exporters to make up for the retaliatory tariffs their country placed on American soy.“There isn’t a single commodity that Missouri farmers produce that hasn’t gone down in the last 90 days and isn’t selling for less than the cost of production,” Hurst said.Trump, in his speech, said farmers support his tough stance against China to win concessions on intellectual property and that “we will not let anybody bully our American farmers.”“They interview (farmers) on television and they say, ‘I know it’s going to be a little tough for a while but he’s doing the right thing, because everybody knows we’ve been ripped off for so long and he’s doing the right thing,’” Trump said. “These are incredible people and, you know, we’ve given them a little help, yesterday.”Reuters and David Carson and Celeste Bott of the Post-Dispatch contributed to this report.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Trump coming to Granite City Steel in wake of trade announcement with European Union,"Jul 26, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/business/local/trump-coming-to-granite-city-steel-in-wake-of-trade/article_302f3db0-9a8f-5f16-801a-5d3e145eb656.html,"WASHINGTON • President Donald Trump will visit Granite City Works on Thursday, a day after announcing a breakthrough in trade talks with the European Union.Trump, who will be joined by Republican Reps. Mike Bost and Rodney Davis, will cite the United States Steel-owned plant as an example of how his trade policies, including tariffs on Chinese steel, have succeeded in getting Americans back to work.

But he’s also coming to a region where other industries have been hurt by retaliation to those policies and that has an agricultural industry that has been so hurt by commodity price erosion in the wake of the tariff wars that the Trump administration is proposing a $12 billion emergency aid package for farmers.Farmers appear to be among beneficiaries of the new agreement with the EU. On Wednesday, Trumpdescribed the agreement as a “new phase in the relationship” with the EU, and the stock market shot up . Under the agreement, Europe will lower industrial tariffs, align regulatory standards on medical products and import more U.S. soybeans.Before a speech in Granite City that is expected to be delivered in the early afternoon, Trump will hear from people who were able to go back to work at Granite City, White House advisers said Wednesday. About 500 people — workers as well as what the White House termed business leaders — will be in attendance. The event is not open to the general public.

        Trump will make his second visit to a community on or near the Missouri border in three days, and amid a huge debate over the impact of his trade policies. His defenders say he is following through on campaign promises to equal trading fields that had been unfair to many American industries.On Tuesday, Trump spoke to the national Veterans of Foreign Wars in Kansas City and invited Attorney General Josh Hawley, who is in a Republican primary to oppose Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., to join him on stage.“70,000 factories were shut down across this county as a result of the unbalance of trade regulations and systems in this country largely since China joined the WTO. That is what the president is focused on,” Jessica Ditto, the White House’s deputy director of communications, said Wednesday. “(Trump) is taking steps to ensure the baseless and unfair retaliation from China and other entities who are responding to this are addressed. That is why the secretary (of Agriculture) rolled out the plan for the agriculture community.”
Granite City Works is in the congressional district that Bost represents. He has supported Trump’s steel tariff actions and lauded the reopening of the steel plant. But Bost, and other Republicans, are on the defensive for proposing a bailout of another industry — agriculture — hurt by retaliation on Trump’s actions.Bost said the $12 billion “will assist agricultural producers to meet the cost of disrupted markets.”
“This short-term relief program to boost our farmers and ranchers allows the Trump administration time to negotiate long-term trade deals that will benefit southern Illinois’ agricultural economy,” Bost said in a statement issued by his congressional office. “The United States has been taken to the woodshed for years by unfair and illegal trade practices by China and others, and the administration is right to try and level the playing field.”Bost’s Democratic opponent, St. Clair County State’s Attorney Brendan Kelly, will have his own event after Trump’s visit, a town hall with organized labor at 5 p.m. at the Tri-Cities Labor Temple, 2014 State Street A, Granite City. It will address Bost’s “failure to look out for Granite City’s steelworkers,” Kelly said.Kelly has been endorsed by the local steelworkers union.Davis pointed out that he, Bost and Rep. John Shimkus, R-Collinsville, supported in 2015 legislation strengthening enforcement rules against illegal trade practices, including steel dumping into U.S. markets by China. Then-President Barack Obama signed that as part of the American Trade Enforcement Effectiveness Act.Davis said Trump “has made cracking down on unfair trade practices a priority, and we’ve seen people in Madison County, and elsewhere, get back to work as a result.”Davis added: “I continue to work with the administration to mitigate any negative impact on agriculture, but when I talk to farmers in my district, many of them support President Trump, just as many criticized me for working with the last administration.”Davis faces Democrat Betsy Dirksen Londrigan in November. National Democrats have targeted this district, Bost’s, and Ballwin Republican Rep. Ann Wagner’s in suburban St. Louis, as potential takeovers.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri governor meets with colleagues in Colorado,"Jul 25, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-governor-meets-with-colleagues-in-colorado/article_3a21ef2e-44bf-5fda-ac9e-2dc46dbb1e41.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Gov. Mike Parson returned to Missouri Wednesday after attending a political conference in Colorado.The two-day event in Aspen marked Parson’s first meeting with the Republican Governor’s Association, which heavily bankrolled his scandal-plagued predecessor’s election in 2016.At the event, the organization held panels and briefings on this year’s 36 gubernatorial elections and about how GOP governors are trying to create jobs in their states.

Other governors on hand for the meetings were Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam.Since taking office, Parson also has visited Washington, where he met with President Donald Trump.• Before you vote in the Missouri primary, learn the candidates and issues
Parson took over as governor June 1 after Gov. Eric Greitens quit amid multiple scandals, including possible federal and state fundraising violations connected to principles associated with the RGA.Michael Adams, who is general counsel for the RGA, was the attorney involved in the filing of an allegedly falsified settlement agreement with the Missouri Ethics Commission in connection with a Greitens fundraising violation. His tenure as the organization’s top attorney overlapped with Vice President Mike Pence’s chief of staff Nick Ayers’ role as executive director of the RGA.
While advising Greitens during his campaign, Ayers discussed soliciting contributions from “restricted donors,”  according to a complaint filed earlier this month with the state’s ethics commission.In his first year in office, Greitens went on at least four out-of-state trips related to his role in the Republican Governors Association, which funneled $13 million into his successful general election campaign against Attorney General Chris Koster, a Democrat.Greitens flew to Florida for an RGA-sponsored conference in Miami at Trump National Doral golf course. He attended another RGA event in Colorado and went to Nashville for a series of meetings.Greitens left for an RGA event in Texas just two days after returning from a weeklong trip to Israel.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Missouri Gov. Mike Parson's allies bank big donations, but stay away from 'dark money' drama","Jul 24, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-gov-mike-parson-s-allies-bank-big-donations-but/article_a64fab0a-7e36-587c-b7e5-4a22c3f9fcc1.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Backers of Gov. Mike Parson have launched a political action committee in support of the Republican chief executive — but, unlike a similar group tied to his predecessor, the names of donors and the amounts they contribute will be disclosed to the public.“We’re going to support, obviously, his policies, and, Lord willing, his re-election bid (in 2020),” John Hancock, chairman of Uniting Missouri PAC, told the Post-Dispatch.Parson, who had been lieutenant governor, took over for former Republican Gov. Eric Greitens on June 1 when Greitens resigned amid months of scandal.

During his 17 months in office, Greitens used the nonprofit group A New Missouri to promote his agenda.In contrast to Uniting Missouri, A New Missouri did not have to reveal its donors because of its nonprofit status. This led to charges that Greitens violated Missouri campaign finance law by intentionally concealing donors and worries that his backers gained unfair influence within state government.“All of our donations will be disclosed,” said Hancock, who is the former chairman of the Missouri Republican Party. “And all of our expenditures will be disclosed. ... That was done expressly at Gov. Parson’s desire not to have any dark money involved in his political world.”Unlike a traditional candidate campaign committee, Uniting Missouri is able to accept unlimited donations. Since Missouri voters enacted limits on campaign contributions in 2016, a growing number of candidates have set up political action committees that do not have to abide by those rules.“Really this is an outgrowth of the way the campaign finance laws are drafted,” Hancock said. “There really would not be a need for a PAC in the old days when there were no contribution limits.”
The Post-Dispatch reported last year on a surge in political action committees following the passage of Amendment 2, which capped individual contributions to campaign committees at $2,600 per election.In contrast to Uniting Missouri’s large donations from a limited number of backers, Parson’s campaign committee raised $106,000 in small donations last quarter from more than 200 contributors.
Uniting Missouri has accepted just more than $155,000 in contributions since its inception on June 29, according to its disclosure forms. Almost all of that money was raised on July 18.Sterling Bancshares Inc., of Poplar Bluff, donated $20,000 to Uniting Missouri. The company, involved in low-income housing tax credit projects, did not respond to inquiries throughout the spring about a role some speculated it played in mysterious cash payments to opponents of Greitens’.Mark Gardner, of Springfield-based Gardner Capital Inc., donated $25,000. MACO Development Inc. in Clarkton donated $25,000. Gardner and MACO are also tied to low-income housing tax credit projects.Greitens led an effort to end low-income housing tax credits last year, which have earned low marks for inefficiencies. Parson supports the incentives, saying they spur necessary investment in underdeveloped areas.Parson has said that he would not try to reinstate low-income housing tax credits this year, and said that any effort to restore them would have to be tied to reforms.Other donations to Uniting Missouri include: $10,000 from Republic Services Inc., a waste-collection company whose properties include West Lake Landfill; $25,000 from St. Louis County-based Express Scripts; $20,000 from St. Louis-based Spire Missouri Inc.; $20,000 from Phoenix Home Care; and $10,000 from Wildwood-based Torch Electronics.

Two other members of that family, including a 13-year-old, survived. The 17 people who died were from four different states, authorities said; 31 people had been on the boat when it sank.

        The accident is the deadliest on Table Rock Lake and on any body of water in the state's modern history, according to Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. John Hotz.The Ride the Ducks boat is an amphibious passenger vehicle, also known as a duck boat. Although the vehicles originated in a World War II design, the age of the sunken boat wasn't clear late Friday.Seven of the 14 survivors were injured, one seriously, Sgt. Jason Pace of the Highway Patrol said. The boat captain survived. But the driver, identified by authorities as Bob Williams, 73, of the Branson area, did not.Authorities late Friday identified the other victims as:•  William Bright, 65, of Missouri.•  Janice Bright, 63, of Missouri.•  Angela Coleman, 45, of Indiana.•  Arya Coleman, 1, of Indiana.•  Belinda Coleman, 69, of Indiana.•  Ervin Coleman, 76, of Indiana.•  Evan Coleman, 7, of Indiana.•  Glenn Coleman, 40, of Indiana.•  Horace Coleman, 70, of Indiana.•  Maxwell Coleman, 2, of Indiana.•  Reece Coleman, 9, of Indiana.•  Leslie Dennison, 64, of Illinois.•  Lance Smith, 15, of Arkansas.•  Steve Smith, 53, of Arkansas. PHOTOS: Tourist boat capsizes on Table Rock Lake

Authorities weren't saying if the boat's windows were closed at the time, possibly trapping people inside, as videos of the boat suggest. They also wouldn't say if anyone on board was wearing a life jacket. The Coast Guard said passengers must have access to life jackets — but there is no requirement they wear them.A survivor from the family who lost nine relatives said the captain told passengers before the tour began not to bother grabbing life jackets, The Associated Press reported.Tia Coleman told Indianapolis television station WXIN that she and a nephew were the only survivors among 11 relatives aboard the boat. She said she lost all her children, but she did not say how many.Coleman said the captain told passengers that they would not need life jackets. By the time of the accident, “it was too late.”A witness, Brayden Malaske, said he watched helplessly as the boat floundered in heavy waves Thursday evening. He shot a video just before it capsized. 














        
            'I didn't even sleep': In Branson, a mix of mourning and moving on

Friends and relatives of the 17 people who died Thursday on Table Rock Lake near Branson when a duck boat capsized try to make sense of what happened.




Malaske, from Harrah, Okla., was on vacation with his family. They were riding on the Branson Belle tourist boat. He said when he boarded, it was sunny. But the storm rolled in quickly, and he noticed two duck boats were struggling in the whitecaps.“Surely, those won't sink,” he thought to himself.

        But then one of the boats sunk lower in the water. He turned away in horror. When he looked back, he saw people in the water but no boat.Malaske said he saw one survivor clinging to the paddlewheel of the Belle.""She was holding on for dear life. We were trying to point everyone toward her,"" Malaske said.A 10-year-old boy was pulled from the water, Mike Pedersen of West Bend, Wis. told the Post-Dispatch. “I took him up the hill to safety. My wife stayed with him until all was cleared. He was really shaken,"" Pedersen said.Pedersen and his wife, Kimberly, had returned from a dinner cruise around the time of the incident and were on the shore. They were asked to leave the area soon after the boy was rescued because authorities said it was a crime scene.Lewis and other friends of Asher and Hamann described them as a kind and fun-loving pair who loved music and dancing. Asher was retired but still ran a deejay sideline that he'd started many years ago.Russ McKay said he met Asher when he contacted him about deejaying at a benefit for a local veteran. McKay said he told Asher he was on a tight budget for the event.""He said 'The price is pretty good because if he is a veteran I'll do it for free,'"" McKay recalled Friday night.McKay said Hamaan was equally generous with her time and talents, eventually joining McKay on the board that oversees a local nonprofit that raises money for veterans causes.""Rosie was the vice president, the treasurer and the cook,"" McKay said.Near the scene of the tragedy, there were at least three vigils held Friday night for the victims.At one, hundreds of mourners gathered in the parking lot of Ride the Ducks for an impromptu memorial service. Holding candles, they stood around the flower-draped cars of the victims, which were still in the lot, and sang “Amazing Grace.”
















        
            Photos: Tourist duck boat capsizes on Table Rock Lake

A 'duck' boat capsized and sank in stormy weather Thursday night, July 19, 2018, at Table Rock Lake in about 80 feet of water.  




Devin McGilberry of New Jersey was among those who rode on the duck earlier in the day when the weather was clear. He said he and his wife feel like they dodged a bullet.""The tour was good. Our captain was nice,"" said McGilberry. ""It's definitely a tragic incident.""Stone County Sheriff Doug Rader told reporters at a press conference Friday that he didn't know if the passengers had been wearing life jackets. Officials said they weren't legally required to wear them.Dive team rescue operations worked overnight in water as deep as 80 feet, Pace said. Officials with the Southern Stone County Fire Protection District said crews from several agencies were on scene Thursday night.

Seven people were taken from the scene by ambulance Thursday night. The dead were believed to have drowned, Rader said.The boat is submerged and cannot be seen from the surface. Laurie Driver, a spokeswoman with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Little Rock district, confirmed the lake at the accident site is 50 to 80 feet deep. It's deep but not the deepest point, she said. Just north of the accident site, closer to the dam near the White River channel, it is 250 feet deep, Driver said. At an afternoon briefing, the sheriff said the National Transportation Safety Board probably would not try to raise the boat until Monday.The Ride the Ducks tourist boats will be closed while the investigation into the deadly boat capsizing on Table rock Lake is under investigation, the company said Friday.The disaster had apparently been caused by the storm, Rader said. The National Weather Service said wind speeds up to 63 mph were reported at the Branson Airport at about 7:30 p.m.Another witness aboard the Branson Belle showboat captured video of two of the duck boats on the lake, apparently just before one of them capsized. The video shows the boats rocking as large waves slam into them. The boats have wheels and can be driven into the water.

Rader said an off-duty deputy from his department had been at the scene when the boat went under. He credited the deputy with rescuing some of the boat’s passengers.People who had relatives on the boat were urged to go to Branson City Hall to await reports. Inside a conference room at City Hall, several people were seen sitting and crying, waiting for updates on the remaining victims.
Branson Mayor Karen Best said two or three groups of families were given food and counseling Thursday night and Friday morning at City Hall. “We became kind of the command center for families,” she said.People involved in the search effort also spent time with counselors, the mayor said. “They are grieving as well,” she said.President Trump posted a message on Twitter Friday morning about the accident. ""Such a tragedy, such a great loss,"" he tweeted, in part.My deepest sympathies to the families and friends of those involved in the terrible boat accident which just took place in Missouri. Such a tragedy, such a great loss. May God be with you all!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 20, 2018

The Coast Guard is investigating the accident, in conjunction with the National Transportation Safety Board, the Highway Patrol and the sheriff's department.The Coast Guard inspects the duck boats annually, looking at everything from the boat's mechanics to watching the captains and drivers conduct ""man-overboard"" drills. Lt. Commander Tasha Sadowicz of the Coast Guard told the Post-Dispatch that the boats are required to have life jackets. ""They would have had them on board,"" she said, although there is no requirement that they be worn.""They are not required to wear them unless the captain or driver ask their passengers to put them on,"" Sadowicz said. ""If you think about it, on a cruise ship, you're not required to wear a life jacket. You have a captain to make that call.""Sadowicz said she doesn't know yet if the captain Thursday told the passengers to wear their life jackets at any point. ""I'm sure that's one of the main points the investigation will look at,"" Sadowicz said.State Rep. Don Phillips, R-Kimberling City, represents a district that includes the lake. He told the Post-Dispatch that it's too early to discuss changing the life preserver law.""I don't know what the company's policy is,"" he said. ""I don't know if the children were wearing them. If there was such a law, it probably would be better for children."" After repeated questions from reporters to the sheriff about life jackets, Gov. Mike Parson said it was too early to talk about rules on life jacket requirements. ""It's going to take some time to get answers to these questions,"" Parson said. ""There's a lot of healing that needs to take place right now.""There were two crew members on board. One was the captain, one was the driver. The captain survived, Sadowicz said.Marketing photos and videos, posted for years by the company advertising the rides, show people not wearing life jackets. Pace of the Highway Patrol said state law requires that the vessels have one jacket for everyone on board and that the jackets be readily ""accessible,"" not stowed under a seat.This video from Ride the Ducks social media page about two years ago, for instance, shows a packed boat of tourists on a leisurely ride on calm water. Not a single person featured in the video is wearing a life jacket.Ride the Ducks

Table Rock Lake was specifically mentioned in the warning, said Kelsey Angle, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service.By that time, southwest Missouri had already been under a severe thunderstorm watch for more than seven hours, which meant that people were warned that conditions were coming together for a potential severe thunderstorm.The actual warning, Angle said, means: ""Take action because life and property area in danger.""After the warning was issued, wind gusts at Branson West were recorded at 52 mph at 6:55 p.m., Angle said.The first call of a capsized boat on Table Rock Lake came to police dispatchers at 7:09 p.m. Thursday.By 7:25 p.m., winds of 63 mph were measured at Branson Airport. The warning was in effect until 7:30 p.m. Additional warnings followed after that.A group of five St. Louis area teens and one parent who were in the area for a softball tournament had to be rescued from jet skis elsewhere in the lake as the storm came in.""It just hit out of nowhere then it was like bullets hitting our back and huge waves,"" said Sabrina Gregory, 16, of Fenton, who saw her teammates fall into the water and struggle to come ashore. None of them were injured. ""A lot of us couldn't sleep last night thinking how close we got.""Rachel Rice, Lisa Brown, Erin Heffernan, Janelle O'Dea, Samantha Liss and Lisa Eisenhauer of the Post-Dispatch contributed to this report.

LOUIS • Vice President Mike Pence touted President Donald Trump’s record since taking office last year in an appearance in St. Louis on Thursday, where he also attended fundraisers for two area Republicans likely to face tight contests this November.“There’s only one way you can sum up the last 18 months,” Pence said. “It’s been 18 months of promises made and promises kept.”In a wide-ranging, 30-minute speech at the St. Louis Marriott Grand on Washington Avenue downtown, Pence highlighted a number of key items on Trump’s agenda, such as his tax cuts, his appointment of conservative judges and his push for stronger borders.

Pence said he estimated the typical family of four in the St. Louis area would save roughly $2,600 a year thanks to the recent tax cuts.“Confidence is back, jobs are coming back, in a word, America is back. And we’re just getting started,” he said.Pence then thanked Missouri Gov. Mike Parson and Missouri House Speaker Pro Tem Elijah Haahr, R-Springfield, for pushing through a bill that will gradually decrease the individual income tax rate in Missouri from 5.9 percent to 5.1 percent.Pence also addressed Trump’s recent summit with his Russian counterpart in Helsinki, where the president drew widespread condemnation even from his staunchest defenders for praising Vladimir Putin and stating he did not “see any reason why it would be Russia” interfering in the 2016 election, rebuking findings by U.S. intelligence agencies.Amid the backlash, Trump later attempted to clarify his comments, and Pence went further to defend the president on Thursday.“Make no mistake about it, President Trump and I support our great intelligence agencies and the courageous men and women who lead them,” Pence said. “And as the president said, we accept our intelligence community’s conclusions about the 2016 election, but after years of the failed reset of the last administration, and capitulation to Russia, under President Trump, we’ve met Russian aggression with American strength and action.”He also emphasized to the crowd the importance of heading to the polls for the midterm elections, throwing support behind Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley, the GOP’s expected challenger to incumbent U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo. McCaskill claims to be a moderate, Pence said, but “votes like (Sen.) Bernie Sanders.”

After the event, Pence was scheduled to attend a fundraiser for Hawley in St. Louis, near Ladue, said a spokeswoman for Hawley’s campaign. The event was not open to the public.Hawley introduced the vice president at the morning event, and both he and Pence pointed to Trump’s nomination of conservative Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court to show what’s at stake this November, as Republicans hope to keep control of Congress.“I know the difference between a court that respects Missouri’s values, and one that dishonors them,” Hawley said. “Claire McCaskill has been wrong on every Supreme Court nominee in her entire career.”Hawley claimed that McCaskill has already made up her mind not to vote for Kavanaugh. But the senator told the Post-Dispatch last week that she had not, and would not until she had read Kavanaugh’s writings and met with him personally.“Anyone who thinks you can make some purely political decision on this is not being realistic about a state like Missouri,” McCaskill said. “It is not like I make a whole bunch of people happy no matter how I vote. The bottom line is you just do what is right and explain it, and Missourians, I think, will understand.”The nomination was also on the minds of a crowd of protesters rallying across the street from the hotel, who fear the risks to abortion and reproductive health care rights should Kavanaugh be confirmed to the nation’s top court.Undeterred by the morning’s rain, the demonstrators wielded signs, painted umbrellas and even a Trump puppet — “This is a Russian puppet,” read the sign next to the ventriloquist — the demonstrators chanted “Lock Pence up” and cheered when passing cars honked at them on Washington Avenue.
They also were protesting Hawley’s decision to enter a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act.The tax bill Congress passed last year, which Trump and now Pence have traveled to Missouri to celebrate, will in 2019 eliminate the tax penalty most Americans must pay for violating the insurance mandate in the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare.Hawley in February signed Missouri onto a lawsuit with 19 other states arguing that a provision in the health care law requiring most Americans to buy insurance is unlawful.That puts protections for people with pre-existing conditions at risk, said Alison Dreith, executive director of NARAL Pro-Choice Missouri, one of the groups organizing Thursday’s rally.
“With women’s rights and protections for pre-existing conditions hanging in the balance, we want to make sure Vice President Pence and Attorney General Hawley get the message loud and clear: Missourians will not go back to being discriminated against or denied care because of their extreme ideological agenda,” Dreith said.Hawley and Pence’s remarks followed a panel discussion hosted by America First Policies, a nonprofit organization set up last year to promote Trump’s policies. The panelists focused on the benefits of the Trump administration’s tax bill and cuts to regulations, citing boosts to their small businesses and increased disposable income.“Overall, we’ve seen unemployment at historic lows across the board,” said Alfredo Ortiz, president and CEO of the Job Creators Network. “There are more jobs available than people who are looking for them.”Pence also was scheduled to appear at a fundraiser for U.S. Rep. Mike Bost in O’Fallon, Ill., at the Regency Conference Center. Like Hawley’s fundraiser, that event was not open to the public.Bost, a two-term incumbent from Murphysboro, Ill., faces St. Clair County State’s Attorney Brendan Kelly, a Democrat, in a nationally watched Metro East race.Bost easily won in 2016, but Democrats think they have recruited a strong challenger in Kelly. Both candidates have been building campaign war chests, with each reporting roughly $1 million in their coffers in April.

Missouri is one of a handful of states that will determine control of the Senate in the last two years of Trump’s current term, and both Democrats and Republicans have targeted the race for McCaskill’s seat as a top priority.McCaskill raised more than double the money Hawley did in the last quarter, but the attorney general does have Trump’s support in a state the president won by almost 19 percentage points in 2016. Trump is set to attend a July 24 fundraiser for Hawley in Kansas City.Hawley is one of 11 Republican U.S. Senate candidates on the Aug. 7 primary ballot. The others are: Brian G. Hagg, Bradley Krembs, Tony Monetti, Kristi Nichols, Ken Patterson, Austin Petersen, Peter Pfeifer, Fred Ryman, Christina Smith and Courtland Sykes.

Mike Parson has directed state agencies to coordinate ways to assist Missouri counties affected by the drought.Parson on Wednesday ordered the activation of the Drought Assessment Committee and drought-impact teams. His order declared a drought alert for 47 counties,

The Department of Natural Resources shows nearly all of Missouri north of the Missouri River was in drought as of July 12, with 15 counties in extreme drought.
The state has already granted a statewide variance that allows grazing on land that would normally not provide grazing.
Missouri also has $2 million available to help farmers plant cover crops to improve feed and forage and other natural resources.Farmers and ranchers in counties affected by drought can apply for assistance at local NRCS offices until Aug. 31.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"In response to complaints, Missouri governor outlines reasons for budget vetoes","Jul 19, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/in-response-to-complaints-missouri-governor-outlines-reasons-for-budget/article_1d31f628-8af4-5069-bf82-b7c93181ad2a.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Although his explanations are coming more than three weeks late, Gov. Mike Parson outlined Thursday why he carved more than $10 million out of the state budget.The two-page explanation from the Missouri Republican’s legislative director Justin Alferman came in response to a request by Rep. Kip Kendrick, D-Columbia, who said the new governor violated the state Constitution when he failed to state the reasons he vetoed the money out of the state budget last month.Kendrick’s request came after a sometimes testy exchange between lawmakers and the administration on Tuesday in which members of the House Budget Committee grilled various agency chiefs on the effects of the cuts.

In his letter to the governor, Kendrick said, “The lack of explanations in this year’s line-item veto messages resulted in substantial confusion during a House Budget Committee hearing today as we attempted to review the impact of those actions. The reasons behind your decisions may very well be sound, but without the benefit of knowing them, committee members were forced to speculate.”Parson, who took office June 1 after the resignation of former Gov. Eric Greitens, signed off on most of the $28.6 billion budget approved by the Legislature in May.But, he cut a number of items, including $500,000 that was supposed to help Harris-Stowe State University renovate facilities for a science and technology laboratory. Parson did leave $250,000 of the grant intact.In his explanation, Alferman said the one-time grant for the St. Louis institution is not an adequate solution for an ongoing problem.“We are committed to finding a long-term solution to the university’s funding needs,” Alferman wrote.Parson also vetoed $1 million that had been set aside to allow for the state to acquire homes contaminated by radioactive waste in the area near the Bridgeton Landfill in north St. Louis county.Alferman said the money, championed by Sen. Maria Chappelle-Nadal, D-University City, and Rep. Mark Matthiesen, R-Maryland Heights, is not necessary because the landfill has agreed to pay $16 million to settle a 2013 lawsuit by the Missouri Attorney General’s office that claimed a “subsurface reaction” was harming the health of nearby residents.Under the terms of the agreement, landfill owners will pay $12.5 million into the Bridgeton Landfill Community Project Fund. The money could be used only as “compensation and restitution” to communities within a four-mile radius of the now-shuttered landfill and to pay for environmental cleanups “explicitly authorized by Missouri law.”
But, the money cannot be used to buy out homeowners, for lawsuits or lobbying or to reimburse any damages or losses, the agreement says.Matthiesen said he was not surprised by the governor’s decision to cut the money because lawmakers had not approved a program designed to oversee how the $1 million would be spent.Parson also vetoed $50,000 for a program that would have paid for police to be equipped with tourniquets to stop bleeding. He said the issue should be left to local governments.
Parson also said he wants to find a new funding source for a program that helps get stroke and heart attack patients to the most appropriate facility in the shortest amount of time.Members of the budget committee scolded Department of Health and Senior Services Director Randall Williams during the Tuesday hearing, accusing him botching the rollout of a new way to fund the state’s Time Critical Diagnosis System, as well as misleading lawmakers about the status of the program.Parson vetoed $153,000 from the program — representing about three full-time staffers — setting off alarm bells that the program may be discontinued.In his explanation, Alferman said the cost of the three people who oversaw the program can be absorbed in the existing budget while the administration attempts to have hospitals finance the program.Lawmakers, including House Budget Committee Chairman Scott Fitzpatrick, R-Shell Knob, argue once the money was vetoed, the program cannot continue unless the House and Senate override the veto in September.Kendrick said the governor’s letter appears to meet the Constitutional requirement that he explain why he cut funds.“We would have liked to have seen this when the vetoes were announced though,” Kendrick said.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Democrats want Missouri Supreme Court to decide lieutenant governor question,"Jul 18, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/democrats-want-missouri-supreme-court-to-decide-lieutenant-governor-question/article_32b4bc28-58ce-5646-aab1-e0cc0b2b19f4.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Democrats in Missouri want the state’s highest court to weigh in on whether Gov. Mike Parson had the authority to appoint a new lieutenant governor.In an appeal filed Tuesday, the party and Hartville resident Darrell Cope said they believe state law intended for the lieutenant governor post to remain empty if it is vacated.Parson, a Republican, was lieutenant governor until June 1 when he took over for Eric Greitens, who quit amid multiple scandals.

Parson then named former Sen. Mike Kehoe, R-Jefferson City, to his old position.Last week, Circuit Judge Jon Beetem said the Democrats lawsuit alleging the appointment was illegal failed on a number of legal fronts, including whether private citizens can try to get rid of officeholders through the courts.
In his ruling, Beetem said the No. 2 post in state government was too important to leave vacant until the next election.
The judge also rejected the party’s assertion that it had the ability to bring the case based on the assumption that Kehoe might run for a full term in the office in 2020, making it harder to elect a Democratic candidate.In the appeal, Democrats say there are numerous examples of the office being left vacant after its occupant has left or died dating to the 1820s.In 1960, for example, Lt. Gov. Edward Long was appointed to a seat in the U.S. Senate. His former office stayed vacant until 1961 when Hilary Bush was elected to the position.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"As primary nears, St. Louis County Council and Stenger spar over vetoes, budgets","Jul 17, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/as-primary-nears-st-louis-county-council-and-stenger-spar/article_2f8bf1bf-a1b4-51ee-ba94-ec43fa827403.html,"CLAYTON • The St. Louis County Council voted on Tuesday to override vetoes of three bills by County Executive Steve Stenger, in a tense meeting highlighting the increasing divide between the county’s legislative and executive branches as a bitterly fought Aug. 7 primary approaches.The meeting featured a rare appearance by Stenger with his political rivals. Stenger had promised the council several weeks ago that he would submit a written report about his meeting with Gov. Mike Parson, but never did. When Council Chairman Sam Page asked Stenger why he had not prepared the report, Stenger told him he was not going to engage in “political shenanigans.”The council then:

Voted 7-0 to override Stenger’s veto of a bill that sought to require that the council confirm the county executive’s appointments to certain boards, commissions and other offices. Stenger had claimed the county charter grants the county executive the power to appoint board members without requiring council approval.Voted 6-1 to override a veto of a bill authorizing the council members to enter a contract with an outside law firm to represent them in a pending lawsuit. A taxpayer sued to block three county charter amendments from appearing on the August ballot, passed by the council in veto overrides. Six council members have intervened as individuals. A decision is expected within days. Stenger wrote in a response that the county counselor’s office was “fully capable” of representing the council in its official capacity and that taxpayers should not have to pay for members who chose to intervene in the lawsuit.Voted 6-1 to override a veto of a bill requiring the removal of any member of the county port authority whose term has expired; Stenger said the charter allowed board members to retain their seats until replacements were appointed.In comments after the meeting, Councilman Mark Harder said that because of a move by Stenger earlier this year to cut the council’s budget, the council would run out of money by Oct. 15 and would cancel the rest of the year’s meetings if an agreement were not reached. He said it was “uncharted territory.”

Stenger said after the meeting that his cuts to the council’s budget were the same as those the council imposed across county government and that none of the council members had approached him for more funding.Page said the “now former” members of the port authority board had been invited to testify at a council ethics hearing next Tuesday investigating the port authority. Led by Councilman Ernie Trakas, R-south St. Louis County, the council’s ethics committee is expected to request financial records and other documents from the economic development agencies as well as call its officials to testify.Stenger said he did not agree that the council could remove port authority board members. “As far as I’m concerned, this ordinance has no effect on them,” he said.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Parson administration under fire over cuts to trauma care program,"Jul 17, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/parson-administration-under-fire-over-cuts-to-trauma-care-program/article_34d1e8c8-998f-5f90-8416-efe85ad09d3e.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Angry Missouri lawmakers put Gov. Mike Parson’s administration on the hot seat Tuesday, scolding top agency heads for bungling a program that helps get stroke and heart attack patients to the most appropriate facility in the shortest amount of time.In a sometimes heated exchange, members of the House Budget Committee accused Department of Health and Senior Services Director Randall Williams of botching the rollout of a new way to fund the state’s Time Critical Diagnosis System, as well as misleading lawmakers about the status of the program.“I am pissed,” said Rep. Scott Fitzpatrick, R-Shell Knob, who chairs the powerful committee.

In June, Parson vetoed $153,000 from the program — representing about three full-time staffers — setting off alarm bells that the program may be discontinued.Brian Froelke, chief medical officer of the Washington University emergency medicine service, told the committee that removing one part of the program will hurt the entire system.“Each part of the system is essential to the system,” Froelke said.After hospitals and EMS officials raised red flags about the veto, Parson and Williams attempted to play down potential problems, arguing that there will be no break in service.“I don’t think there’s going to be any change in the services provided by that budget cut,” Parson told reporters Monday. “I don’t think you’re going to see any change in service.”In Tuesday’s hearing, Williams said: “We just think this is a pretty important program.”“If you think it’s important, why did it get vetoed?” Fitzpatrick responded.Williams said the purpose of the veto was to jump-start talks with hospitals about altering the source of funding for the program. He said there will be a meeting next week to discuss a plan that would require hospitals to pay about $1,000 per year to fund accreditation.“It was never our intent to interrupt services,” Williams said. “We thought this was a viable alternative.”
After outcry over the veto, Williams said he brought back employees who had been doing the job to keep the program afloat.“We feel we’ve got flexibility within that section to move things around,” said Parson’s budget chief Dan Haug.Fitzpatrick said the budgeting process doesn’t allow for Williams to switch people into other jobs.“That is not how the game works,” Fitzpatrick said.
It is not the first run-in Williams has had with the budget panel. Earlier this year, the Legislature cut eight positions in the director’s office after he refused to release information about an outbreak of the tick-borne Bourbon virus.Williams, a North Carolina physician, was brought to Missouri to run the agency by former Gov. Eric Greitens.Williams acknowledged he never approached lawmakers with an alternative funding plan when they were crafting the budget last spring.“That does not make sense at all,” said Rep. Robert Ross, R-Yukon.Because of the change in funding, Fitzpatrick said if the agency attempts to continue operating the program, the Legislature will penalize the agency.“There will be significant consequences,” Fitzpatrick said. “You guys messed up.”“I think this is completely unacceptable,” said Rep. Jered Taylor, R-Nixa.The program may be able to continue until the Legislature returns for its veto session in September. Williams said two hospitals are scheduled to be recertified between now and September. Williams said he believes he can delay that process to keep the program from being interrupted.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Harris-Stowe makes pitch to restore $500,000 cut by Missouri governor","Jul 17, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/education/harris-stowe-makes-pitch-to-restore-cut-by-missouri-governor/article_5f86cfe5-e7d7-5a8e-a1f0-2be870a60f08.html,"Editor's note: This story has been updated to correct the amount vetoed to $500,000.JEFFERSON CITY • A top official at Harris-Stowe State University called on lawmakers Tuesday to restore funding that was cut last month by Gov. Mike Parson.In testimony to the House Budget Committee, Harris-Stowe Provost Dwyane Smith said Parson’s decision to reduce a $750,000 special grant by $500,000 will again delay plans to improve computer science laboratories and upgrades to the main administration building.

The funds that were vetoed were “very much needed,” Smith said.The university had initially secured a $2 million special grant in the Senate, but that was trimmed to $750,000 during negotiations between the House and Senate. Parson cut that by another $500,000, leaving the university with $250,000 in additional funding.The House panel spent Tuesday reviewing a series of vetoes that Parson made to the state’s $28.6 billion budget worth a total of $10 million. The governor did not specify why he reduced the university's grant.Smith said the university serves 1,460 mostly low-income students in the St. Louis region and needs more state assistance than other public institutions of higher education.
And, he added, “We have one of the lowest tuition rates.”
Although no decision was made by the committee on whether to override the veto when lawmakers return to action in  September, the request for money was supported by some members of the panel.“Some of the offices that the teachers work in are not very big either and yet they fit four people in there,” said Rep. Donna Lichtenegger, R-Jackson. “I think this funding is very important.”Rep. Karla May, D-St. Louis, said she was disappointed that money for the university was cut again. “We want to educate all of our students in every corner of the state. And every corner of the state is not the same,” May said.The legislation is House Bill 2003."
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Greitens' campaign spends $600k on legal bills, more on political consultants","Jul 16, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/greitens-campaign-spends-k-on-legal-bills-more-on-political/article_2128c2c9-d992-53b0-af7c-546c0652def9.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Former Gov. Eric Greitens spent more than $588,000 on legal fees in the final months of his scandal-plagued administration.According to campaign finance reports released Monday, the ex-chief executive funneled more than $551,000 from his campaign fund to Husch Blackwell, the law firm of Catherine Hanaway, a former Missouri House speaker who was hired to defend Greitens' campaign operation amid the multiple investigations that led to his demise.He also sent five- and six-figure checks to two other law firms as he tried to fend off legal challenges, including the Kansas City-based Graves Garrett firm, which also had an attorney working for the Office of the Governor.

That Graves Garrett did work for both the campaign and the governor's office raised conflict-of-interest concerns from at least one lawmaker who investigated Greitens and his campaign apparatus.""If the office of the governor does have the authority to hire outside counsel,"" said Rep. Gina Mitten, D-Richmond Heights, ""a conflict of interest could arise to the extent the office of the governor is adversely impacted by Greitens for Missouri.""Last month, the state announced it would not pay a total of $153,000 in legal bills to two attorneys whom Greitens' office hired. The attorneys have said they represented the office of the governor, not the governor himself, though others have said the attorneys primarily benefited Greitens personally.Ed Greim, the Graves Garrett attorney who was hired to defend the governor's office, said the law firm's work on the campaign was unrelated to impeachment proceedings. He also said that while the interests of the campaign and the governor's office were different, they weren't ""at war"" with each other and thus did not pose a conflict.
Republican Rep. Jay Barnes, R-Jefferson City, who had led a special committee investigating whether Greitens should be impeached, filed a complaint last week alleging multiple campaign finance violations.
Emails included in the complaint feature staffers discussing how unnamed donors should not give directly to the campaign and how to funnel money from donors who are restricted from contributing.The latest report shows Greitens with $1.1 million left in his account after spending more than $3.6 million between April and July 1. With two felony charges hanging over him and the House committee probing his ouster, Greitens raised just $2,874 during the quarter.In addition to the legal fees, Greitens spent big on consultants and media, including more than $509,000 to California-based Target Enterprises. Nick Ayers, chief of staff to Vice President Mike Pence, is a partner in the company.He also paid $58,000 to Jimmy Soni, a former member of the administration who wrote speeches for Greitens.It remains unclear where Greitens has been since he moved out of the Governor's Mansion last month.Just as Greitens' influence in Jefferson City was waning, then-Lt. Gov. Mike Parson, also a Republican, started raising campaign contributions at a faster clip.Between April and July 1, Parson raised more than $106,000, far outpacing the $11,000 he brought in during the previous fundraising quarter.Then-state Sen. Mike Kehoe, R-Jefferson City, contributed $1,000 to Parson's campaign on April 16. Parson appointed Kehoe lieutenant governor after Parson took over the state's top job.Parson continued to pay political consultant James Harris through the spring, sending the consultant's company more than $7,600 over the fundraising period. He also paid Campaign Concepts LLC — a firm owned by the sister of former House Speaker Steve Tilley of Perryville — $3,000 during the reporting period.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,August primaries heat up in Missouri as candidates and PACs report fundraising hauls,"Jul 16, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/august-primaries-heat-up-in-missouri-as-candidates-and-pacs/article_b53eeb56-286d-56ae-87b0-8d665cdd8d90.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • A coalition of labor unions fighting to stop Missouri from becoming a right-to-work state ended the most recent fundraising quarter with $3.7 million in its campaign account.On a day in which candidates and political action committees reported their quarterly contributions and expenditures ahead of the Aug. 7  primaries, the numbers from the We are Missouri PAC show the pro-labor group far ahead in fundraising over its opponents.The trio of political action committees working in support of right to work reported having a total of $985,118 after the April, May and June reporting period.

• Research your ballot with the Post-Dispatch voters guideThe money-check came as Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican, said Monday he would hit the campaign trail trying to convince voters to vote “yes” on the proposition.“We support right to work and I’m sure we’ll be out there on the campaign (trail),” Parson told reporters at the Capitol. “We’re not sure scheduling wise how much that will be, but yeah, we’ll be supporting that issue.”Under the proposal, workers could not be compelled, as a condition of employment, to join or to pay dues to a labor union.We Are Missouri has raised a total of $12.3 million in its effort to overturn the law approved last year. Between April and July 1, the coalition raised $5.4 million and spent $6.8 million.The group Freedom to Work has $441,289 after raising $562,000 in the quarter. The account spent $1.3 million during the past three months, including $900,000 to a company owned by one of former Gov. Eric Greitens’ consultants, Jeff Roe. The money was supposed to pay for the collection of signatures to put a pro-right to work referendum on the ballot, but backers failed to turn in any of the signatures needed.A second group, Missourians for Freedom to Work, has $539,960 in its account after raising $592,000 in the quarter. Among the donors was $100,000 from Joplin mega donor David Humphreys, a roofing material company. Among its biggest expenditures was $42,000 for a Virginia-based polling firm to do focus groups.The third PAC, Missourians for Worker Freedom, has $3,869 in its account after receiving one $5,000 contribution from Liberty Alliance.In the Republican race for auditor, attorney David Wasinger of Huntleigh had $760,968 in the bank, fueled largely from an early $500,000 loan he gave himself.Rep. Paul Curtman, R-Pacific, reported $20,939, after raising $9,399 in the quarter.Businessman Kevin Roach of Ballwin had $2,877 in his campaign account, while Saundra McDowell, a Jefferson City attorney, ended the quarter with $1,522 in her account. She raised $3,501 and spent more than $5,400.The winner will take on Democratic Auditor Nicole Galloway in November. She reported having $1.1 million in her account.Contested primaries also are on tap for a number of seats in the Missouri House and Senate. Among them:• 73rd House District: Three Democrats are vying for the seat currently held by Rep. Courtney Curtis, D-Ferguson. The district encompasses St. Louis Lambert International Airport and includes all or parts of Berkeley, Ferguson, Bridgeton and St. Ann.Lee Smith of Ferguson has $3,436 in his account. The former president and business manager for the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 2352 received just one $150 contribution in the most recent quarter.
Raychel Proudie, who had considered a run for the Ferguson-Florissant school district last year, has $7,421 in her account after raising $6,245 in the prior three months.Floyd Blackwell, the former mayor of Cool Valley, did not file a quarterly report by Monday's 5 p.m. deadline.• 86th House District: Four Democrats are vying to represent this district, which takes in part of University City north of Delmar Boulevard and smaller municipalities around Page Avenue. State Sen. Maria Chappelle-Nadal, D-University City, is term-limited in the Senate but can serve one more term in the lower chamber.She had the most cash on hand as of July 1 among the slate of candidates, which includes Farrakhan Shegog, 26, of University City; retired engineer Gloria Nickerson, 64, of University City; and educator Bobby Shields, 56, of University City.• 14th Senate District: Three Democrats are running in this heavily-Democratic district, which stretches from Clayton to the Missouri River and takes in all or parts of municipalities such as Ferguson, Berkeley, University City and Normandy.Rep. Joe Adams, D-University City, was leading the cash race as of July 1, recording more than $62,000 on hand and a nearly $17,000 fundraising haul last quarter. Former Rep. Sharon Pace, D-Northwoods, raised $2,800 and had $27,900 on hand.
A third candidate, Brian Williams of University City, is a former staffer of U.S. Rep. William ""Lacy"" Clay. Williams had $41,460 on hand and raised $22,510 last quarter. One $100 check came from former U.S. Rep. William  Clay, Sr., who told the Post-Dispatch Monday that ""I know him and I think he's a well-qualified individual.""Chappelle-Nadal has a historically icy relationship with Adams, who ran against her for state Senate in 2010. She said Monday she is leaning toward voting for Pace. She said the two men in the race have focused their campaigns on University City, offering Pace an opening to snag votes in other parts of the district.• 95th House District: Republicans Joe Patterson and Michael O'Donnell are running in the Republican-leaning 95th District, which takes in Oakville in south St. Louis County. Republican Rep. Marsha Haefner is term-limited.Patterson, 32, a police detective for St. Louis County, raised $18,000 last quarter, spent $17,000 and had $23,300 cash on hand as of July 1. He describes himself as pro-labor and said he would vote ""no"" on the Aug. 7 right-to-work referendum.O'Donnell, 50, a Navy reservist, raised $600 last quarter and had $3,270 in his campaign coffers as of July 1. ""They money side's probably the most difficult,"" he said. O'Donnell supports the right-to-work initiative.• 97th House District: Three Republicans are running for the chance to unseat Rep. Mike Revis, a Fenton Democrat who won a special election to the Republican-leaning Jefferson County seat in February.David Linton, an attorney whom Revis beat in February, had $1,600 on hand after spending $2,100 last quarter. Mary Elizabeth Coleman, 36, a lawyer and former Arnold City Council member, raised $8,014 and had $10,352 on hand. A third candidate, Phil Amato, 64, a former Arnold City Council member, raised $6,300 last quarter, spent $6,800 and had $4,400 on hand.Amato said he's endorsed by LIUNA Local 110, which donated the maximum $2,600 to his campaign in June. Amato, who ran for Jefferson County Council as a Democrat in 2010, said he is pro-labor but his values align with the Republican Party because of the Democrats' leftward drift.""I didn't leave the party (the Democrats),"" he said. ""The party left me.""Coleman said she is voting ""yes"" on Prop A, but said she is from a union family and expects to see voters shoot down the pending law on Aug. 7.""Unions are a vital part of our community,"" Coleman said, adding that she is in the ""middle"" between Amato and Linton when it comes to union issues. Linton did not return a request for comment.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri cuts funding for program that sped up care for stroke and heart attack victims,"Jul 16, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-cuts-funding-for-program-that-sped-up-care-for/article_c3badb62-a264-54f9-be00-893d34235f75.html,"Health care providers across Missouri are worried about funding cuts to a program that has helped clinicians in their race against the clock in rushing stroke and heart attack patients to the most appropriate facility in the shortest amount of time.Advocates say the program has helped to improve coordinated care for patients through what is known as the state’s Time Critical Diagnosis System.The American Heart Association said the program had reduced the time it took to get patients treated, which can lead to better outcomes.

But despite those advances, Gov. Mike Parson vetoed about $150,000 from the program — representing about three full-time staffers — fueling concern about the program’s longevity.For years, Missouri has operated the program to identify hospitals that can effectively treat stroke and heart attack patients. Hospitals voluntarily seek the designation after meeting certain criteria.The program was a move away from simply taking patients to the closest facility, instead taking them to the most appropriate facility that can handle seriously ill patients. It’s modeled after the same system for serious traumas.“The American Heart Association is deeply troubled by this action,” said a letter the association sent July 9 to the director of the Department of Health and Senior Services. “TCD (Time Critical Diagnosis) is doing exactly what it is supposed to do, and we are now concerned these gains could be lost.”Karen Englert, government relations director for the association, said that in Missouri there was a significant jump over a five-year period in the number of patients who received tPA, a clot-busting drug, and transferred to a larger facility for care. The drug, Englert said, is incredibly effective at preventing long-term disability that can come with strokes.Englert told the Post-Dispatch her organization was “very surprised to see the cuts.”Emergency responders are kept up to date on which hospitals are designated as the state’s go-to facilities for heart and stroke victims.If a hospital is not on the state’s list, emergency crews will bypass the hospital in favor of another. That could become problematic as expiration dates for the designation approach.
“If you had a center 30 miles away and they expire and the next one is 100 miles away, that’s a problem,” said Mark Corley, regional director of Abbott EMS in St. Louis.Hospitals also are concerned for the program’s future as the system used to store the data shut down earlier this week.However, Dr. Randall Williams, director of the Department of Health and Senior Services, said that was for maintenance.
The Missouri Hospital Association said it was all sending mixed signals about whether the program would continue and the state’s commitment to it.“The program is continuing. The governor’s veto was never about the importance of the program. The issue is over the funding of the program,” Williams told the Post-Dispatch.But cutting about $150,000 from a much larger budget of $1.4 billion budget is raising eyebrows.“It’s stepping over a dollar to pick up a dime,” Englert said.Williams said it was about creating buy-in and having hospitals pay a nominal fee to support the program.The department is proposing that the hospitals that have received a level 1 or 2 designation — typically larger, urban hospitals — pay a fee to subsidize the hospitals at levels 3 and 4, typically smaller or rural hospitals. The goal would be to exempt smaller or rural hospitals from paying anything.“We greatly appreciate the hospitals and EMS working together because we think this is a very helpful service to the people of Missouri,” Williams said.Advocates and providers plan to voice their concern about the cuts at a budget hearing Tuesday in Jefferson City.

Eric Greitens, Missouri is set to form an 18-member commission to plan and sponsor a centennial observance in 2026 for the Mother Road, which stretches 2,400 miles from Chicago to Los Angeles.In Missouri, the now-decommissioned two lane highway generally follows the path of Interstate 44 across the state. In St. Louis, Route 66 wound its way through a number of alignments, including the Chain of Rocks and McKinley bridges, Chouteau Avenue, Tucker Boulevard, Gravois Avenue, Chippewa Street and Manchester Road.

The mainstay along old Route 66, built as a 1920s gas station, was renamed in 1959 by Carl Meyer. Meyer sold it to Frank Cunetto in 1986, who carried on the tradition of burgers and root beer almost 30 years until last year when it was sold to Mike Franklin.

Heading west, it went through Wildwood, Eureka and Pacific.During its time in service, the road was a key route for Americans migrating during the Great Depression and a popular vacation travel route after World War II. It was phased out in 1985 as it was replaced by the interstate highway system.

Throughout the eight states it crosses, many of the roadside businesses built to serve travelers closed as traffic dwindled to a trickle.Under terms of the law sponsored by Missouri Rep. Lyndall Fraker, R-Marshfield, the commission will plan and sponsor official Route 66 centennial events and activities, encourage the development of programs to involve residents in activities that commemorate Route 66 centennial events and make information available to the public about Route 66 events.New Gov. Mike Parson has not selected members for the panel.

Fraker said he hoped to be appointed to serve on the panel.As a youngster in the 1960s, he recalls piling into the family station wagon to head on Route 66 to St. Louis Cardinals baseball games. While some of the roadway had already been transformed into what would become I-44, he said some of the old diners and motels were still along the route.Now, he lives next to the old highway.
In his hometown of Marshfield, Fraker envisions erecting signs directing motorists to the downtown business district as a way to boost tourism. He also said grant money could pay to paint water towers along the route promoting local connections with the old road.

“We see motorcycle clubs, Corvette clubs and old vehicles traveling the highway. We just feel like we’re not really taking advantage of it,” Fraker said.Kate Renfrow, spokeswoman for the Missouri Division of Tourism, said a recent survey showed that 5 percent of the state’s visitors report that they do some type of Route 66 activity when they are visiting the Show-Me State. Of those, nearly half said the old road was a motivator for their visit.
In Illinois, Rep. Tim Butler, R-Springfield, sponsored a similar proposal that now awaits the signature of Gov. Bruce Rauner. There, Route 66 roughly followed the route that is now Interstate 55.Butler said he was in Atlanta, Ill., recently and counted six out-of-state license plates on the main street in town.

“When you drive on 66 in Illinois, you go through small towns like Atlanta. They’ve done a wonderful job of rehabbing their downtown,” Butler said.He said the centennial commission could help other communities tap into the market.“I think you’re going to see communities leverage it for economic development purposes. It’s a huge draw for people around the world,” Butler said.In Washington, U.S. Rep. Rodney Davis, R-Taylorville, Ill., is sponsoring legislation to establish a national commission that will plan for the centennial and create a plan to ensure the iconic road is preserved for future generations. The proposal, which is pending in the House, is known as “House Resolution 66.”“We’re just trying to get the ball rolling for the centennial,” Fraker said.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Oops. Truman statue in U.S. Capitol on hold after paperwork glitch,"Jul 14, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/oops-truman-statue-in-u-s-capitol-on-hold-after/article_9863e8ca-d8ef-544b-894f-1e524f21757b.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • A paperwork mix-up in Missouri has scuttled plans to place a statue of Harry S Truman in the U.S. Capitol.In action Friday, Missouri Gov. Mike Parson vetoed legislation that would remove a statue of former U.S. Sen. Thomas Hart Benton in the Capitol’s Statuary Hall in order to make room for one of the nation’s 33rd president.Parson said the legislation approving the statue switch, approved on the final, frenzied day of the Legislature’s spring session, wrongly described which Benton would be replaced.

Benton, the great-great uncle of the famed mural painter by the same name, served five terms in the Senate. Benton’s abolitionist views cost him the Senate seat in 1850. He later served in the House.But, Parson said the legislation he received from lawmakers suggested the statue being replaced was the painter, not the politician.It was not clear Friday how the language of the bill had gotten the two confused, but it appeared in May that the version being voted on by members of the House and Senate had been corrected.Sen. Dan Hegeman, R-Cosby, who sponsored the legislation, could not immediately be reached for comment.In a statement, Parson’s office said, “The governor will be reaching out and meeting with House and Senate leadership next week to explore options and discuss efforts to address veto concerns.”In any case, the push to get a Truman statue into the Capitol will be on hold until at least next year while the situation is clarified.
Each state gets two statues in the Capitol's Statuary Hall, located just footsteps from where Congress does its business.The state’s other statue is of Francis Preston Blair, who served most of a nearly two-decade congressional career in the House of Representatives during and after the Civil War, culminating in two years in the Senate.In 2002, the Legislature approved replacing Blair with Truman. Last year, the state’s two senators, Democrat Claire McCaskill and Republican Roy Blunt, said they want to proceed with the plan to replace Blair.
But Republican members of Missouri’s delegation in the House said they favored replacing Benton, the former senator.During debate on the matter, Hegeman said he favors keeping Blair over Benton because of Blair’s role in keeping Missouri from becoming a Confederate state during the Civil War.And, he said he is following the wishes of the members of Congress.“Many of the delegation would like to see Benton be the one removed. Blair did help keep the State of Missouri in the Union,” Hegeman said at the time.The legislation notes that Truman “was the most important statesman Missouri ever gave the nation, an outstanding county official, United States Senator, Vice President and President of the United States who brought the Second World War to completion, led the free world at the beginning of the Cold War, and stood for fairness and opportunity for all Americans.”The legislation is Senate Concurrent Resolution 50.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Editorial: Short takes on poached poachers and Puerto Rican patriots,"Jul 13, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-short-takes-on-poached-poachers-and-puerto-rican-patriots/article_43a9c9d2-4662-5138-8fad-c5666d2181d8.html,"Darwin's delightThere’s delicious irony (delicious, at least, for the consumers involved) in the deaths of poachers at an African wildlife refuge who came face-to-face with a pride of lions. At least two suspected rhino poachers entered a South African game reserve, apparently hoping to kill rhinos and sell their parts on the lucrative black market.There’s a bizarre belief in China and Vietnam, among other countries, that rhino horn contains mysterious medicinal properties. Rhino horns consist of the same material as human fingernails.

A family of lions, known as a pride, decided to poach on the poachers instead. By the time the lions were done, South African officials were hard-pressed to determine who the poachers were or how many or of them had succumbed. ""We're not sure how many there were — there's not much left of them,” game reserve owner Nick Fox told Agence France-Presse.Starbucks without the strawsStarbucks ranks among the world’s worst offenders when it comes to filling waste bins with plastics, whose particulates are increasingly making their way into waterways and oceans. The company is estimated to hand out more than 1 billion plastic straws a year.But by 2020, Starbucks says it will abandon the use of plastic straws while introducing new, recyclable “strawless lids” and straws made of biodegradable materials. The company plans to spend around $10 million on the transition, which is a welcome way to halt corporate practices that are rapidly depleting ecosystems in the world’s waterways and contributing to fish die-offs.Un-caging kids' brainsCage fighting is a vicious and violent activity that barely qualifies as a sport. At a time when professional and college athletes are becoming attuned to the extreme dangers posed by repeated blows to the head, more and more parents are opting to keep their children out of participating in risky contact sports like football and boxing.Missouri lawmakers this year passed a bill, signed into law by Gov. Mike Parson on June 29, banning kids under age 18 from competing in mixed martial arts competitions. Even veteran fighters say it was the right move to ensure kids’ safety. Unlike boxing, where blows are somewhat softened by big, thickly padded gloves, mixed martial arts fighters use small gloves that have the effect of maximizing physical damage with each blow.Who needs it? Kids certainly don’t. Score one for a smart bill to keep young brains young.Nuts to that idea
The free peanuts are half the reason people fly Southwest Airlines. OK, maybe not half, but rarely has a nonfood commercial service had its identity so thoroughly wrapped up inside those tiny packets of roasted nuts distributed to passengers, with gusto and good humor, on Southwest Airlines flights.We know there are serious nut allergy sufferers out there, and Southwest cited those passengers’ health concerns as the primary reason for ending the distribution of packaged peanuts on future flights.But it’s a sad day for Southwest devotees who all too often rush to board flights without grabbing something to eat and count on those peanuts to keep them from starving till arrival at the next destination. Somewhere, there’s an advertising account executive wracking his or her brain figuring out how to replace the airline’s peanut-oriented pitch for low-cost fares.Red, white and clueless
A Puerto Rican woman, Mia Irizarry, wore a shirt bearing her island territory’s flag while setting up a picnic table at a Chicago park. For reasons that can only be attributed to ignorance and Trumpian xenophobia, a man began berating her, saying, “You should not be wearing that in the United States of America.”Sadly, like lots of people, he didn’t realize that Puerto Rico is part of the United States and that Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens. The confrontation was recorded on video, including Irizarry’s appeals to a nearby police office to help stop the man from harassing her.The officer didn’t. In fact, he seemed to deliberately look the other way. (He wound up resigning after a video of the confrontation went viral online.) Other officers later intervened and cited the harasser with assault and disorderly conduct. He’s lucky that abject ignorance isn’t also a crime.No more penalizing pregnancyNew moms in workplaces everywhere understand the professional penalty that all too often accompanies pregnancy — a loss of stature and seniority, or sometimes a demotion or layoff accompanying a return from parental leave. The penalty is painfully evident in women’s sports, particularly tennis, where pregnancy tends to get the same treatment as an absence due to injury. But pregnancy isn’t an injury.Top players, including champion Serena Williams, find themselves bumped way down in rankings, while their bottom seeding in major tournaments forces them to be matched up with the high-caliber players they normally wouldn’t face until the finals. Williams had to fight her way to Saturday’s Wimbledon finals after her return from pregnancy landed her in the 25th seed.The United States Tennis Association announced that it will halt the practice of low-seeding women returning to play after childbirth. ""Pregnancy will not be penalized,"" USTA spokesman Chris Widmaier said. ""If Serena Williams enters the 2018 U.S. Open, the USTA will recognize her accomplishments, recognize her return to the workplace and will seed her, regardless of what her ranking is.""That’s a major step in the long road toward equalizing the treatment of women and men in major professional sports competitions."
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri governor OKs changes to prevailing wage law for construction projects,"Jul 13, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-governor-oks-changes-to-prevailing-wage-law-for-construction/article_59ddb467-6e84-58b0-8255-af2c0f5bec25.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican, endorsed on Friday a plan to change Missouri’s prevailing wage law.At a bill signing ceremony in his office, Parson gave his approval to a plan altering how wages are calculated on government construction projects.Currently, local governments such as schools, municipalities and counties must pay a set wage for various maintenance and construction jobs. The amount, which is higher than the minimum wage, varies from county to county.

The changes would affect only projects that cost more than $75,000.The bill’s sponsor, Rep. Jeff Justus, R-Branson, said the change would help smaller, rural school districts, cities and counties by lowering the cost of certain construction and maintenance projects.“Listening to county commissions and city officials and some school officials all across the state, they had examples of how public projects were much more expensive under the old law,” Justus said. “This will help the taxpayers.”
Republicans have sought to eliminate the state’s prevailing wage laws, arguing that they artificially inflate the cost of government construction projects.But Democrats say it results in better trained employees’ working on public works projects. Among those affected are bricklayers, masons, ironworkers and electricians.
Senate Minority Leader Gina Walsh, D-Bellefontaine Neighbors, said she had worked on a compromise for over a year.“I did not vote for the bill, but it is much better than full repeal,” Walsh said Friday.She said full repeal could have been harmful to contractors who build their business models on current state labor law.In addition to the $75,000 threshold, the new law bars governmental units from dividing a project into multiple contracts for the purpose of lowering the total project cost below the cap.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri is known as a haven for child marriages. A new law aims to change that.,"Jul 13, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/missouri-is-known-as-a-haven-for-child-marriages-a/article_baf82d1e-82f8-50d1-817a-f87ea3fe836e.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Gov. Mike Parson signed on Friday legislation that institutes a minimum age of marriage in Missouri, capping an effort among lawmakers and advocates to crack down on child marriage in the state.When the law takes effect on Aug. 28, no one under the age of 16 will be able to get married in Missouri. Anyone older than 21 will be unable to marry anyone under 18, according to the law.“Missouri will no longer be a haven for underage marriages. We’re protecting children from predators,” Rep. Jean Evans, R-Manchester, who sponsored the change, said in May after the measure’s passage.

Missouri was one of 27 states in the country with technically no age limit on marriage, according to a Post-Dispatch report last year. Minors can marry at 15 with a parent’s consent, and, alternatively, can seek a court order at any age to receive a license.The new law still requires parental consent if the teenager is a minor. It also removes the ability for courts to issue marriage licenses to minors if the judge finds good cause.Missouri’s loose regulations meant that the state had one of the highest rates of child marriage in the country, according to the Tahirih Justice Center. The center counted 7,342 minors that were married in Missouri between 2000 and 2014.Eighty-five percent of those were girls, according to the group.Evans and other proponents of tighter laws say they are trying to combat an overlooked form of coercion and trafficking, where parents can force children into marriage against the child’s best interests.One example from 2016 was when an Idaho father brought his 14-year-old pregnant daughter to Kansas City to marry a 24-year-old man. The man was later convicted of raping the girl, even though they were married.
Another provision in the legislation Parson signed removes the statute of limitations for sexual offenses that involve a minor.Senate Bill 655, the child marriage bill, was one of several pieces of legislation the Missouri Legislature approved this year aimed at addressing sexual and domestic offenses — at the same time then- Gov. Eric Greitens was battling allegations of sexual misconduct of his own.An omnibus education measure Parson signed Friday includes language requiring that schools teach the concept of sexual consent to students during sexual education courses.
Greitens, before leaving office, signed legislation outlawing so-called “revenge porn.” The law makes it a felony to intentionally publish online a photo or video of someone’s naked or partially naked body without their permission.Greitens also signed a measure allowing local prosecutors to convene “domestic violence fatality review panels” after domestic-violence related homicides so that law enforcement can assess what red flags, if any, went unnoticed before a dispute spiraled.The law also eases access to the state’s crime compensation fund for victims of sexual violence, institutes new tracking and processing requirements for rape kits, and allows victims to track their abusers if the abuser violates a protective order and is outfitted with electronic monitoring gear.Another measure expanded the state’s “Safe at Home” program, which allows victims of “domestic violence, sexual assault, rape, human trafficking or stalking” and their minor children to wipe their address information from public records.The new law expands the availability of the program to victims of any crime who fear for their safety.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"While Missouri GOP cheers tax cuts, some worry about a benefit to the wealthy","Jul 12, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/while-missouri-gop-cheers-tax-cuts-some-worry-about-a/article_2427f57b-a40c-5fc5-8647-a84a3add9983.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Thanks to a package of tax cuts signed Thursday by Republican Gov. Mike Parson, Missourians will see a drop in their income tax rates starting next year.But one group says the state’s wealthiest earners will reap the most benefits, while others will see a “negligible” impact in their tax bills.Parson’s office said in a statement Thursday that because the state is meeting revenue growth goals, the state’s individual income tax rate will drop to 5.8 percent from 5.9 percent for filings in 2019, because of previous tax cuts lawmakers approved in 2014.

Under a measure Parson signed in Springfield, the state’s individual income tax rate will continue to decrease. On Jan. 1, 2019, the rate will drop to 5.4 percent and then slide to 5.1 percent if the state continues to meet revenue targets.But, Traci Gleason, spokeswoman with the left-leaning Missouri Budget Project, said that at the same time the state is reducing income taxes, it is phasing out the Missouri tax deduction for federal taxes paid.Low- and middle-income earners may not notice a change if they have not claimed that deduction in the past.Other taxpayers may not see a reduction at all, Gleason says, because, “As you move up the income scale, the deduction will be reduced, and middle-income earners would see their state income taxes increase. However, that’s offset by the income tax rate reduction.”A second factor is that the income level at which Missouri’s highest income tax kicks in is dropping, she said.“The brackets are shifting downward, which means the highest rate of tax will be applied to a lower level of income,” Gleason said. “This offsets the rate reduction for many people.“The combination of the phaseout of the state deduction for federal taxes paid plus the downward shift in brackets offsets most of the tax rate reduction for most Missourians,” she added.Gleason said that the more a Missourian earns, the more likely that person is to see a noticeable reduction in his or her bill.“Those earning on average $1.4 million per year will get a tax cut of about $2,200 per year,” the Missouri Budget Project said in a statement on Thursday.Nevertheless, Parson’s office cheered the legislation, promising that it will “boost Missouri’s economy” and allow “Missouri families to keep more of their paychecks.”“This is the first step in an ongoing process,” Parson said in a statement. “We need to continue to make the Missouri tax code simple and fair.”
His office said that if the rate ultimately drops to 5.1 percent, Missouri will have the 14th-lowest income tax rate in the country.When the law is phased in by 2023, state analysts predict that state tax revenue will fall by $5.8 million, a fraction of the state’s $28 billion budget. Lawmakers, however, continually grapple with revenue that lags behind the state’s growing commitments.When asked Thursday whether he was concerned about a loss in revenue, Parson said the state is being “cautious” as Republicans rewrite the tax code.“We’re well aware of the instance that occurred in Kansas. We’re trying to make small steps,” Parson told the Post-Dispatch. “We’re being really cautious as we do this.”
Rep. Elijah Haahr, R-Springfield, the incoming House speaker, has said this year’s tax slashing will be small compared to infamous Kansas tax cuts; lawmakers there had to raise taxes after dramatic reductions in state services.“The Kansas thing is such a bogeyman. It’s so annoying,” Haahr said in May when lawmakers approved the cuts.Rep. Deb Lavender, D-Kirkwood, said that she ultimately voted “no” on Haahr’s bill because Republicans had stripped out a proposed low-income earned tax credit, “so we still as a state missed an opportunity to give low-income people a break in their taxes.”Lavender said that she still has worries about Senate Bill 509, which the Legislature enacted in 2014 over a veto from then-Gov. Jay Nixon, a Democrat.In addition to giving Missourians their first state income tax cut in nearly a century, the legislation provided a new 25 percent deduction for business income reported on individual returns.Lavender said the provision helped “blow a hole” in Missouri’s budget, and the GOP-controlled Legislature did not go far enough in closing that hole this year when it lowered the business income deduction to 20 percent, she said.“This bill attempted to close some of that hole,” she said, “but I don’t think it did a good job in closing that.”Lawmakers this year approved a separate reduction in the state’s corporate tax rate, which former Gov. Eric Greitens signed before he left office last month.Under that plan, the corporate rate will drop to 4 percent, down from 6.25 percent, beginning in 2020.Kurt Erickson of the Post-Dispatch contributed to this report.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Judge dumps Democratic bid to oust Missouri lieutenant governor,"Jul 12, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/judge-dumps-democratic-bid-to-oust-missouri-lieutenant-governor/article_a449fc94-700d-5e6a-83a4-16705f196e89.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • A Cole County judge tossed out on Wednesday a Democratic challenge to Gov. Mike Parson’s appointment of a new lieutenant governor.In a scathing decision, Circuit Judge Jon Beetem said the Democratic attempt to oust former Senate Majority Floor Leader Mike Kehoe from his new job failed on multiple legal fronts, including whether private citizens can try to get rid of officeholders through the courts.“Under Missouri law, a private plaintiff lacks authority to seek the removal of a public official through litigation,” Beetem wrote.

At issue is Parson’s appointment on June 18 of Kehoe, R-Jefferson City, to his new role.Parson, 62, had been lieutenant governor until June 1, when then-Gov. Eric Greitens quit after 17 scandal-plagued months in office.The lawsuit brought by the Democrats and lead plaintiff Darrell Cope of Hartville says the lieutenant governor position can be filled only by an election.In the nine-page ruling, Beetem attempted to settle the long-running debate over a governor’s ability to appoint a lieutenant governor. He said the No. 2 post in state government was too important to leave vacant until the next election.“Given the importance of the office of Lieutenant Governor, this court is reluctant to adopt an interpretation of Missouri law that would generate such an unreasonable and anomalous result,” the judge wrote.Kehoe, 56, who has moved into the lieutenant governor’s office, said he was grateful for the decision.“When I was sworn in as lieutenant governor on June 18th, I pledged to Gov. Parson and the people of Missouri that I would work to improve the state through infrastructure and work-force development. Since then, I have visited state departments throughout central Missouri, met with community and business leaders across the state, and begun the process of integrating myself with the numerous boards and commissions on which I will serve,” Kehoe said.
Attorneys representing the state argued that the governor had the ability to fill vacancies in public office, unless there is a law specifically addressing how a vacancy should be filled.In addition, they pointed to 2000, when Roger Wilson moved from the lieutenant governor post to the governor’s office after the death of Gov. Mel Carnahan, a Democrat. Wilson then picked Joe Maxwell to fill his old position.Once Kehoe was sworn into office, the lawyers argued, he could be removed only by impeachment or through the intervention of the attorney general’s office.Beetem agreed.
“First, Plaintiffs here are private parties, not government officials,” he wrote.In a statement, Parson said, “This affirms our position as well as the position of previous governors from both parties. We look forward to continuing our work with Lieutenant Governor Kehoe and also commend the work of Attorney General Josh Hawley’s office in effectively arguing the merits of this case on an important constitutional issue.”The judge scoffed at the Democratic Party’s assertion that it had the ability to bring the case based on the assumption that Kehoe might run for a full term in the office in 2020, making it harder to elect a Democratic candidate.“This allegation is conjectural, hypothetical and speculative. It is entirely unknown and unknowable whether Lt. Gov. Kehoe will decide to run for the office of Lieutenant Governor in 2020; whether he will prevail in the Republican primary if he does run; which Democratic candidates, if any, might run against him; and whether his incumbency would provide any material advantage in the election if he does run and win the primary,” Beetem noted.“This allegation piles speculation upon conjecture. It is too speculative and hypothetical to support standing. No injury in fact can arise simply from incumbency,” he added.Attorney Matt Vianello, who represented the Democratic Party and Cope, said, “My clients are disappointed in the result, and we are exploring our options for appeal.”

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Next-gen Air Force jet trainer must take off from Missouri,"Jul 11, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/columnists/next-gen-air-force-jet-trainer-must-take-off-from/article_ba3a1f24-7556-5e52-9064-723c02560394.html,"Since McDonnell Aircraft Corp. opened its St. Louis plant in 1939, our state has been on the cutting edge of aviation.The Show-Me state built the FH-1 Phantom, the Navy’s first all-jet airplane. The F-101 Voodoo, which flew 82 missions over Cuba during the Cuban Missile Crisis, was built here. We helped build the AV-8B Harrier for the Marine Corps. We continue to build E/A-18 Growlers and F/A-18 Super Hornets, the backbone of the Navy’s strike fighter fleet, and the Advanced F-15 flown by U.S. allies around world who depend on its next-gen capabilities.And, with the Air Force about to award a contract for the service’s new two-seat jet trainer, Missouri should again play a big role building the next major aircraft for our military. But only if the Air Force selects the only truly American-made aircraft in the competition — the Boeing T-X trainer, which calls Boeing’s St. Louis plant home.

For over 50 years, the Air Force has trained new pilots using the T-38 Talon. But, even the newest Talons are now aging since production ended in 1972, and the Air Force is finally replacing them with a new, next-generation trainer.The Air Force recently laid out a long list of requirements for this “T-X” aircraft and supporting training systems and asked its industry partners for their most innovative ideas. The T-X will have a challenging mission, preparing American pilots for today’s advanced fighters and bombers — such as the F-15 Eagles, F-22 Raptors, and F-35 Lightnings — but also the new aircraft we haven’t yet dreamed up.During the six years I served in the Army, I learned first-hand just how important it is to give our men and women in uniform the best equipment possible. In my 30 years of public service, I learned that doing so can also help boost the economy here at home.
That is why as lieutenant governor, I launched the “Buy Missouri” initiative to highlight and promote Missouri-based companies that invest in our workers and state. And now as governor, I am fighting to attract even more new jobs and boost our economy every day.Nonetheless, when looking at the three proposals to build the T-X trainer, I believe the choice is obvious because the fact is America’s next trainer aircraft should be made right here in the heart of America.
Economically, Boeing has approximately 14,000 employees in Missouri and numerous suppliers ready to do their part in building and supplying the new T-X. More than 90 percent of the jet will be American-made. And the program office, engineering and final assembly line will be right here in Missouri, generating and sustaining more than 1,800 well-paying jobs.Recently, I got to see Boeing’s new T-X, a truly impressive machine. It is highly capable with maximum versatility, and it’s clear that every detail was well thought out. For example, the seating — which was designed to be stadium style, gives the instructor in the back seat the ability to see everything the trainee is doing up front. Indeed, Boeing’s T-X is the jet designed to ensure all of the Air Force’s capabilities and requirements are met.I believe the Boeing “Made in America” T-X that will take off from right here in Missouri — and carry U.S. air supremacy forward for the next generation of pilots — is the best choice for our national security and economy.Mike Parson is the governor of Missouri."
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Parson to sign measure lowering Missouri income tax rates,"Jul 9, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/parson-to-sign-measure-lowering-missouri-income-tax-rates/article_144b70e6-5a5f-5951-a47b-163d385b0901.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Income tax rates in Missouri will drop next year as part of a tax cut being signed by Gov. Mike Parson on Thursday.Under the election-year plan approved by lawmakers in May, the individual income tax rate will decrease to 5.5 percent on Jan. 1, down from 5.9 percent.The rate would gradually drop to 5.1 percent if the state meets revenue targets. To offset the expected loss in revenue, the proposal would phase out a federal income tax deduction.

When fully implemented in 2023, analysts say it will result in an estimated $5.8 million less in revenue.Parson signaled his intent to sign the legislation on Monday when he released his schedule for the remainder of the week. Along with job creation announcements in Sedalia on Tuesday and Warrensburg on Wednesday, the new governor will travel to Springfield on Thursday for the tax bill signing.The measure was sponsored in the House by Rep. Elijah Haahr, R-Springfield, who will take over as speaker of the House next year.“Obviously, I am very excited,” Haahr said Monday. “I think this is one of the capstones of the session.”Despite causing massive financial headaches in neighboring Kansas, efforts to reduce tax rates in Missouri were pushed hard by GOP members of the House and Senate during their spring session.
Former Gov. Eric Greitens, who quit under the cloud of scandal on June 1, hit the road for a tour this year calling on lawmakers to approve a larger package of cuts worth more than $800 million.Haahr contended that his plan is much smaller than what went into effect in Kansas. Lawmakers there were later forced to raise taxes in order to adequately fund education and other services.
Initially, Haahr had wanted to take the top rate down to 5 percent in order to make Missouri one of the 10 lowest states for income tax rates. But, he said the 5.1 percent mark will still move Missouri into the lowest 15.The signing of the individual income tax cut comes after Greitens signed a separate reduction in the corporate tax rate before he left office.Under that plan, the corporate rate will drop to 4 percent, down from 6.25 percent, beginning in 2020.Amid the moves by lawmakers to reduce taxes, lawmakers also voted to put a question to voters in November to raise taxes on motor fuel.Under the ballot question, Missourians will be asked whether to boost the state’s gas tax from 17 cents per gallon to 27 cents over the next five years to pay for road and bridge repairs.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri poised to regulate cage fighting after years of lax oversight,"Jul 9, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-poised-to-regulate-cage-fighting-after-years-of-lax/article_cbc92ecb-b4dd-5605-9ff4-1d069c39f8e1.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • In a move aimed at protecting children from serious injuries, Missouri is poised to adopt new rules barring people under the age of 18 from competing in mixed martial arts competitions.The new regulations are the result of legislation approved by Missouri lawmakers in May that will shift oversight of cage matches from sanctioning bodies to the state Department of Insurance, Financial Institutions and Professional Registration.In pressing for the law’s passage, Rep. David Gregory, R-Sunset Hills, said the changes he sponsored would stop minors from getting “their heads bashed in in a cage fight.”

“They can still train, they can still fight in all mixed areas of martial arts, they just can’t ground and pound in a cage,” Gregory said.The measure moved through the House on a 112-29 vote and was approved by the Senate 32-1. It was signed into law by Gov. Mike Parson on June 29.Although attempts to impose tougher regulations on cage fighting have been debated in Missouri for over a decade, the new law is winning accolades from mixed martial arts trainers.Jesse Finney, a former fighter, current trainer and mixed martial arts promoter, called the new regulations “long overdue.”“It’s for the safety of the sport, long term,” Finney said. “This means kids can’t fight in a cage with small gloves and get the crap beat out of them.”
Prior to the law, Finney said private promoters of fights could allow a 6-year-old to get into a cage with a 12-year-old.“This law is common sense. It needed to be done,” Finney said.
The changes will be administered by the department’s Office of Athletics, which is overseen by Tim Lueckenhoff.Lueckenhoff said the state anticipates having rules in place to begin regulating fights by Aug. 28.Along with making sure minors are barred from fights, the state will issue permits for events and send inspectors to those events, similar to what the office does for boxing and kickboxing competitions.He expects the number of amateur events to decrease as promoters adjust to more stringent oversight. Among the changes is a provision that will allow the state to track head injuries and bar fighters from engaging in a contest before they are cleared by a physician.The state also will have the ability to stop promoters from allowing fighters that are clearly mismatched, such as a 115-pound fighter going against a 255-pound fighter, Lueckenhoff said.“The sad part about it is that some people think we shouldn’t be regulating this,” Lueckenhoff said.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri Democrats spar over abortion,"Jul 7, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-democrats-spar-over-abortion/article_60f714b7-ab33-50eb-9d20-2037f91827d1.html,"JEFFERSON CITY   •   Missouri's Democrats are facing a conversation about their abortion-rights stance after the party recently adopted an amendment aimed at welcoming anti-abortion candidates.The state party added an amendment to its platform last week stating it welcomes ""all Missourians who may hold differing positions on (abortion)"" and sees diversified views as its strength, the Kansas City Star reported.The amendment came as the recently announced retirement of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy opens the possibility that the Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion could be overturned. It also came amid Missouri Gov. Mike Parson's signing of a state budget that defunds Planned Parenthood.

""There's really good reasons to be frustrated and angry and concerned right now,"" said Stephen Webber, chairman of the Missouri Democratic Party. ""But the bottom line is the Democratic Party fights to empower women to make their own reproductive decisions, and that's never going to change.""The Democratic Party has struggled to clarify its stance on abortion as it works to win back elected offices in Republican-dominated areas.
""We are losing votes because people think you can't possibly be a Democrat and be pro-life,"" said Joan Barry, a former Democratic state representative  from south St. Louis County who proposed the amendment at a committee meeting.
""We are tired of being second-class citizens in our party. We just want to know we are accepted in the party under our broad umbrella.""St. Louis Alderman Annie Rice of the 8th Ward said she's fine with a personal objection to abortion but concerned with how candidates will vote once elected.The amendment is another example of the party ""conceding that reproductive health is just a social issue and isn't an economic issue for women all over the state,"" she said.""If we don't talk about how contraception and access to abortion allows women to fully participate in the economy, if we don't lead, we're never going to educate people.""

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Judge questions Democratic strategy in fight over Missouri lieutenant governor,"Jul 5, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/judge-questions-democratic-strategy-in-fight-over-missouri-lieutenant-governor/article_ec5fcc22-33b6-5731-8f35-dd3108162244.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • A lawyer for the Missouri Democratic Party acknowledged Thursday that a judge cannot formally oust Lt. Gov. Mike Kehoe from the job he’s held for less than a month.

In a hearing Thursday, attorney Matt Vianello agreed with attorneys representing Kehoe that only the Legislature has the power to remove a lieutenant governor from office.

With that in mind, Vianello said he merely wanted Cole County Circuit Judge Jon Beetem to issue a ruling saying a governor cannot fill a vacant lieutenant governor post.If Beetem agreed, it would then be up to Kehoe to decide whether he should step down from the job. The tactic raised questions for the judge, who will decide the outcome in the coming days.“What’s the point?” Beetem said. “What are you asking me to do? Tell the Legislature to impeach him?”The Democratic strategy also raised the eyebrows of Kehoe’s attorney John Sauer.“He’s kind of tiptoeing back and forth,” Sauer said of Vianello.At issue is new Missouri Gov. Mike Parson’s appointment of Kehoe June 18 to serve as lieutenant governor.Parson, 62, was elevated from his job as lieutenant governor when then-Gov. Eric Greitens quit on June 1 after just 17 scandal plagued months in office.Despite questions of its legality, Parson then picked Kehoe, a Jefferson City Republican, as lieutenant governor on June 18. Kehoe and Parson served together in the Senate for seven years.
The lawsuit brought by the Democrats and lead plaintiff Darrell Cope of Hartville says the lieutenant governor position can only be filled by an election.“The Constitution does not provide a means of appointing a lieutenant governor. It is silent on the subject,” Vianello wrote.In addition, Vianello said that the Constitution calls for the lieutenant governor and the governor to be elected separately. By allowing a governor to fill the vacancy, it could make Kehoe a puppet in the Senate, where the lieutenant governor has the power to cast tie-breaking votes.
“This is not to suggest that former Senator Kehoe would be a mere cat’s paw for the governor. But laws are written and should be interpreted for the office and not viewed solely by the individual of the moment,” Vianello noted.Attorneys for the 56-year-old Kehoe say Beetem should dismiss the case.Under the state Constitution, Sauer, a top assistant to Attorney General Josh Hawley, said the governor has the ability to fill vacancies in public office, unless there is a law specifically addressing how a vacancy should be filled.In addition, Sauer said in 2000, after the death of Democratic Gov. Mel Carnahan and the elevation of Roger Wilson from lieutenant governor to governor, Wilson named Joe Maxwell to fill his old position.He also said once Kehoe was sworn into office, he can only be removed via an impeachment.Even before Parson appointed Kehoe, lawmakers acknowledged there was ambiguity in the appointment process.The Senate approved legislation that would allow a governor to appoint a lieutenant governor if the post becomes vacant, but the measure was rejected in the House.

Renovations began in 2013 and were expected to be completed much sooner. But there were delays before and after the groundbreaking, including disagreements over financing obligations among the local and federal public agencies involved.Voters in St. Louis and St. Louis County played a pivotal role in the renovations when they approved Proposition P in 2013, which secured $90 million in sales taxes for the work.Tuesday’s fanfare featured a ribbon-cutting and speeches by U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke; Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo.; Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo.; St. Louis Mayor Lyda Krewson; and St. Louis County Executive Steve Stenger.McCaskill applauded St. Louisans who decided to tax themselves “to make sure we take care of our crown jewel, the Arch.”Krewson acknowledged the unity behind the project. “I think this is an example of what we can do when we come together and we make the big decisions at the city and county level.”

Stenger summed up the sentiment of area residents:“This may be a national park, but on a personal level, it feels like ours,” he said.Cindy Steinbruegge, 63, has lived in St. Louis since she was in second grade. She remembers visiting the Arch when it was being constructed, and later, bringing her own kids to see it.
Mike Fuoss, 71, and his wife, Lori, 62, brought their son to the Arch several times when he was young. Their son turned out to be one of the lead architects for the renovation project.The Fuosses traveled from their home in Peoria, Ill., to share this moment with their son, Joel Fuoss, of Trivers Associates architects in St. Louis.Mike Fuoss said he was most excited about seeing how the Arch evolved.“It makes it very special to us and to the city of St. Louis,” he said.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,A gas tax hike could be on the November ballot in Missouri – unless this lawsuit stops it,"Jul 3, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/a-gas-tax-hike-could-be-on-the-november-ballot/article_56ec0fd8-6177-5b63-9ea4-8e98aba122f5.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • A state legislator from southwest Missouri has filed a lawsuit in an effort to stop a proposed gasoline tax increase from appearing on the state’s November ballot.In the lawsuit, filed Monday in Cole County Circuit Court, Rep. Mike Moon, R-Ash Grove, argues the referendum violates the Missouri Constitution because the measure’s wording deals with two topics, which is not allowed.














        
            Hitting the road this summer is going to hit your wallet

Gas prices are soaring and will be at their highest-prices since 2014.  






Legislators approved the referendum in the closing hours of this year’s legislative session, tacking the gas tax issue onto a bill authorizing a tax deduction for Olympic medals.Moon also argues the Olympic medals bill was an “improper vehicle” for a referendum. Referendums go straight to the ballot; bills go to the governor’s desk.“When we declared our independence from King George III, Americans decided to establish a new system based on the consent of the governed,” said Ron Calzone, an activist from Maries County who filed the lawsuit with Moon. “That includes constitutional checks on the powers the people bestow on officeholders, like strict legislative procedures designed to ensure that each bill is properly considered before becoming a law.”The lawsuit names Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft, the state Highway Patrol and the Missouri departments of transportation and revenue as defendants.“The constitution provides clear steps upon which a bill must follow in order to be deemed constitutional,” Moon said in a written statement. “HB 1460, in my understanding of the Constitution, stumbles on those clearly marked steps.”

A coalition of Democrats and Republicans in the House narrowly approved the measure in May. Upon voter approval, it would gradually increase gasoline taxes in Missouri from 17 cents a gallon to 27 cents a gallon by 2022.Rep. Jean Evans, R-Manchester, who sponsored the bill, said Tuesday morning she had yet to read the lawsuit.“With a big caucus like we have, there’s lots of room for disagreement on things,” she said of debate within the House GOP.
Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican, has signaled his support for the increase, saying the state cannot continue delaying a major infrastructure plan.Officials with the Missouri Department of Transportation have long raised concerns about a backlog of projects the agency faces.Missouri’s gasoline tax is among the lowest in the nation. But increasing the tax by a dime would place the state’s fuel tax above the national average, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.Analysts say the tax could bring in an additional $293 million annually for the state road fund once the full amount has been implemented.“This is a major, major issue for the nation and our region and our state,” Patrick McKenna, director of the Missouri Department of Transportation, said in May.The legislation is House Bill 1460.

Mike Parson has appointed a Webster Groves woman to the panel.In an announcement Monday, Parson named Rose Windmiller to the 10-member board comprising five Illinois appointees and five Missouri appointees.Windmiller is the associate vice chancellor of government and community relations at Washington University in St. Louis. She holds a bachelor’s degree in political science from the University of Missouri-St. Louis and a master’s degree in public administration from St. Louis University.

She previously served on a special state panel as one of 16 members of the Ferguson Commission, which was formed by former Gov. Jay Nixon to address the “social and economic conditions” highlighted by protests after the 2014 killing of Michael Brown by former Ferguson police Officer Darren Wilson.Windmiller’s appointment comes after a 2017 announcement by St. Louis County Executive Steve Stenger and St. Louis Mayor Lyda Krewson that they had submitted panels of nominees to former Gov. Eric Greitens to replace four Missouri members on the Bi-State Development Agency board whose terms have expired and to fill one vacancy.
They said a “reset” is needed for the Bi-State board amid concerns about crime and safety on the light rail system that operates on both sides of the Mississippi River.
In addition to former St. Louis Mayor Vincent Schoemehl, other commissioners who could lose their seats are Vernal Brown, a United Auto Workers retiree; Constance Gully, an executive with the Parents as Teachers National Center; and Aliah Holman, a brand manager for a marketing firm. Brown and Gully represent the county on the board; Holman and Schoemehl, the city.Windmiller, who was nominated by Stenger and Krewson, filled an existing vacancy on the board.Because Parson made his appointment when the Legislature is out of session, Windmiller can begin serving immediately. She will then come up for confirmation when the Senate reconvenes.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"With boost for education and worker salaries, Parson signs state budget","Jun 29, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/education/with-boost-for-education-and-worker-salaries-parson-signs-state/article_f301dd92-aaba-562e-87a1-63b1ff3b43ea.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Gov. Mike Parson signed off on a $28.6 billion state budget Friday that puts more money toward the nation’s lowest paid state workforce and boosts spending on public education.The spending blueprint, which goes into effect Sunday, contains about $600 million in additional spending over the current fiscal year. It is built on the assumption that state revenues will grow 1.9 percent next year.The governor, who has been in office for just a month, did use his line item veto power on a handful of items totaling $10 million, including erasing a $1 million program designed to help the state buy homes contaminated by nuclear waste in north St. Louis County.

“One of the biggest responsibilities the Legislature holds every year is allocating our taxpayers’ hard-earned money responsibly and efficiently,” Parson said in a written statement. “We applaud the General Assembly for their efforts to fund critical functions of government including infrastructure, workforce development, and education funding.”The budget, approved by the Legislature on May 9, rejected a number of recommendations sought by former Gov. Eric Greitens, who left office under the cloud of scandal on June 1.He had sought to reduce spending on kindergarten through grade 12 schools and higher education.But with Greitens fighting for his political life during an election year for most members of the Legislature, schools will receive a nearly $99 million funding increase, allowing lawmakers to claim the state is meeting its core school funding goals outlined in state law. It also boosts state aid for school transportation costs by $10 million.St. Louis School Guide: Get test scores and moreIn all, the spending plan earmarks $6.1 billion for schools.The budget also restores $68 million that Greitens had sought to cut from state universities and community colleges.That move allowed St. Louis Community College to announce Thursday it was rescinding a planned 5 percent tuition increase that was set to go into effect for the fall semester.Parson also used his veto pen to reduce a $750,000 grant to Harris-Stowe State University in St. Louis. He chopped $500,000 off the allocation, leaving the institution with $250,000. Democratic lawmakers had sought an extra $2 million in funding for the historically black university.“We must operate within our means, make fiscally responsible decisions and invest wisely to ensure our next generation is given the same opportunities to succeed,” Parson said.The budget also includes language barring public universities from offering in-state tuition rates to students who are in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. DACA recipients, commonly referred to as “Dreamers,” arrived in the U.S. before they turned 16, were younger than 31 in June 2012, completed high school or served in the military, and had clean criminal records.
For most state workers, including mental health workers, laboratory technicians and other employees, the budget includes a pay hike of $700 a year. Prison guards will receive a total increase of $1,050 in a bid to boost the hiring and retention of officers.The raises, however, won’t kick in until January .Not all employees will receive raises. Officials at the Department of Conservation are reviewing a revamp of worker pay within the agency separately from what the budget bill allowed. In exchange for the raises, lawmakers approved a separate bill that changes the state’s civil service system governing how employees get hired, retained, promoted, transferred or disciplined.
Greitens called for the changes to make it easier to hire and fire people and to give merit-based raises.The budget cuts spending at the Department of Health and Senior Services, which has been in a showdown with legislators over the release of data about a deadly, tick-borne virus.Eight positions in the agency director’s office were slashed after the department refused to reveal how many people have tested positive for antibodies for the Bourbon virus that killed a Meramec State Park employee in 2017.The spending plan also strips Medicaid funding from Planned Parenthood, not just for abortion services. The move could put the state in violation of federal law, which says recipients can see the participating health care provider of their choice.M’Evie Mead, of Planned Parenthood Advocates in Missouri, called the maneuver a “cruel attack.”“Gov. Parson had a chance to reject former Gov. Greitens’ attacks on women’s health and rights. He has let down thousands of Missourians who depend on Planned Parenthood for their health care. He has ripped a hole in Missouri’s already-strained safety net,” she said.The legislation is House Bill 2002 through House Bill 2013.Note: Updated on July 2 to clarify that Missouri Department of Conservation employees would not receive raises under the budget.@KurtEricksonPD on Twitterkerickson@post-dispatch.com"

Mike Parson signed a law Friday that will expand where Betts’ deputies can arrest people.













St. Louis Sheriff Vernon Betts


City of St. Louis


The new law, which was approved by state lawmakers in May, will give those deputies the option of receiving a police officer certification.

Currently, St. Louis is the only sheriff’s department in the state where deputies can only enforce courtroom security, transport prisoners and deliver summons.Once trained and certified, the change would allow them to make arrests anywhere police officers can.Following the signing, Betts said his department is the largest in the state and should meet the same professional standard of every other sheriff’s office in Missouri.“The citizens of St. Louis deserve to have deputies who meet this basic law enforcement standard,” Betts told the Post-Dispatch. “This is a big thing. It puts us on par with everyone else in the country.”
In addition, once the department is certified he will be able to apply for federal and state grants to help offset the cost of operations, equipment and training.
Betts emphasized that the sheriff’s office is not seeking to replace the St. Louis Police Department as the agency responsible for enforcing the criminal code.But, in some instances, deputies could be used to monitor parades or other large events, freeing up police to patrol elsewhere.“We’re not seeking to become police officers,” Betts said. “But we want to make sure the people of St. Louis feel safe.”Parson, a former sheriff in rural southwest Missouri, has said public safety is a top priority in his administration.The legislation is Senate Bill 652 .

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Fight over appointment of Missouri lieutenant governor heads to court next week,"Jun 28, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/fight-over-appointment-of-missouri-lieutenant-governor-heads-to-court/article_5bdb2144-61b8-59a4-8633-37be8fc1671a.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • A lawsuit that could decide whether Gov. Mike Parson had the legal authority to appoint his own replacement will go before a Cole County judge next week.Circuit Judge Jon Beetem is scheduled to hear arguments in the case brought by the Missouri Democratic Party on July 5.Parson, 62, was elevated from his job as lieutenant governor when scandal-plagued Gov. Eric Greitens quit on June 1. Amid questions of its legality, Parson then appointed former Senate Majority Floor Leader Mike Kehoe, R-Jefferson City, as lieutenant governor on June 18.

Hours later, the party and lead plaintiff Darrell Cope of Hartville filed a lawsuit arguing that the lieutenant governor position be filled only by an election.Cope, a World War II veteran, said he has standing to sue because one of the lieutenant governor’s duties is to serve as an advocate for veterans.In the lawsuit, Democrats say the appointment should be nullified.Attorneys for Kehoe are asking Beetem to dismiss the case.Under the state Constitution, they say the governor has the ability to fill vacancies in public office, unless there is a law specifically addressing how a vacancy should be filled.
“The plan and ordinary meaning of the Missouri Constitution vests the governor with this authority,” the attorneys wrote.In addition, they say once Kehoe was sworn into office, he can only be removed via an impeachment. And, the motion to dismiss says Cope is not claiming any injury from the appointment.
Kehoe, 56, has not yet fully moved into the lieutenant governor’s office. On Wednesday, he was in St. Louis where he visited a health clinic.Parson’s appointment followed an attempt in the Legislature this spring to enact a law that would allow a governor to appoint a lieutenant governor if the post becomes vacant.The effort was approved in the Senate but rejected by the House.The legislation would have clarified what has become a disagreement among legal experts and lawmakers on whether a Missouri governor has the power to fill the vacancy.Former Gov. Jay Nixon, a Democrat, and other former chief executives say Parson has the ability to name a replacement lieutenant governor. Nixon served as attorney general before being elected governor in 2008.Former Missouri Supreme Court Chief Justice Michael Wolff, however, says there is no law authorizing the governor to appoint, nor the voters to elect, a person to serve as lieutenant governor to fill a vacancy in the office.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Editorial: Waste, fraud and abuse in effort to cut waste, fraud and abuse","Jun 28, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-waste-fraud-and-abuse-in-effort-to-cut-waste/article_534c12be-e4f9-5f71-af57-edcc66fd40e3.html,"For at least the third time in recent years, the state of Missouri is turning to a private contractor to do work that used to be done by employees of the Department of Social Services. This latest contract is particularly troubling, as it was awarded at inflated prices to the former employer of the state’s chief operating officer.The notion that private enterprise can outperform public employees is part of the conservative code, promoted relentlessly by billionaire activists. In the case of previous DSS contracts, vendors have done poor jobs, and the state’s citizens have not been well served. However, because DSS serves poor people, and vendors tend to make political campaign contributions, the Legislature and four different governors — one Democrat and three Republicans — haven’t been worried about poor performance.The latest contract was for a “rapid response” analysis of alleged waste, fraud and abuse in the state’s Medicaid program. The $2.7 million contract was awarded June 7 to McKinsey and Co., a highly regarded national management consulting firm. Before then-Gov. Eric Greitens created a $130,000-a-year job for him as the state’s “chief operating officer,” Drew Erdmann worked for McKinsey.

But that’s not the only reason this contract is suspicious. McKinsey’s bid for the deal was higher than the combined bids of three other well-regarded management or accounting firms. KPMG, one of the so-called “Big Four” auditing firms, offered to do the job for $750,000.“This is good government,” former state Treasurer Sarah Steelman, head of the Office of Administration under Greitens and now Gov. Mike Parson, told the Post-Dispatch’s Tony Messenger. “It really is.”
No, it’s not.
One of the reasons the DSS staff may have trouble keeping track of abuse in the Medicaid program is that, starting more than a decade ago, Govs. Matt Blunt, a Republican, and Jay Nixon, a Democrat, began whacking the DSS workforce. County offices were closed as workers were replaced with by a statewide computerized phone system that often didn’t work. In 2013, the Nixon administration signed a $147 million contract with a Maryland firm, EngagePoint, to consolidate outdated computer systems into a comprehensive network called the Missouri Eligibility and Enrollment System. That didn’t work either and in 2015, Missouri cut ties with EngagePoint.That same year the Legislature, lobbied by a Virginia company called Maximus, decided that there were lots of deadbeats receiving state benefits. Lawmakers decided to hire yet another private vendor to verify eligibility. But private enterprise hasn’t yet been able to get it together.All of this has made it much harder for confused and overwhelmed clients to obtain benefits while grinding down the morale of those who work with the state’s most vulnerable citizens. It’s almost as if this was the plan all along."

Pittman said trustees boosted tuition in March at a time when then-Gov. Eric Greitens’ budget proposal called for a cut of $68 million for higher education.When lawmakers reversed that and restored the proposed cut in May, Pittman said he was given the authority by trustees to rescind the tuition increase.“The direct beneficiaries are the students,” Pittman said.Gov. Mike Parson, who took over for Greitens when the scandal-plagued governor quit on June 1, is set to sign off on the overall $28.3 billion budget blueprint in a formal ceremony Friday.Under the plan, most colleges and universities will receive the same amount of money they are receiving in the current fiscal year. The deal came after university leaders agreed to limit tuition increases to 1 percent. Under state law, tuition could increase as much as 2.1 percent.
St. Louis Community College students who have already paid at the higher rate will be credited for the difference.Tuition and fees for the 19,000 students at four campuses in Ferguson, St. Louis, Wildwood and Kirkwood will now be $110.50 per credit hour.
Pittman said he lobbied hard for restoration of the proposed cuts, arguing that ensuring that college is affordable will help both students and employers.“I met with every legislator that had time to meet with me,” Pittman said.The budget earmarks $409.7 million for operations of the University of Missouri System, which includes the state’s flagship institution in Columbia.Harris-Stowe State University in St. Louis will receive a special $750,000 grant. Democratic lawmakers had sought an extra $2 million in funding for the historically black university.Harris-Stowe’s total state funding is $9.4 million. It has 1,400 students.The higher education budget also includes language barring public universities from offering in-state tuition rates to students who are in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. DACA recipients, commonly referred to as “Dreamers,” arrived in the U.S. before they turned 16, were younger than 31 in June 2012, completed high school or served in the military, and had clean criminal records."

Missouri Sen. Jamilah Nasheed, a Democrat, wrote the letter to Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican, on Tuesday, the day after a cab driver was found dead in the street and another man was gunned down outside a pizzeria. 

""To date, there have been 79 homicides in the St. Louis area in 2018. By the time you receive this letter, that number will almost certainly have gone up,"" Nasheed wrote.The 79 homicides are for St. Louis city. That's less than the 90 homicides the city had at this point in 2017, but that year ranked as the deadliest in decades.The city said crimes against people are down 6 percent from last year and property crime is down 2.6 percent.Sen. Nasheed calls for State of Emergency due to homicides in the city, calling it the crime violence epidemic. pic.twitter.com/FguVEyxzIm— Jamilah Nasheed (@SenatorNasheed) June 26, 2018

With a state of emergency in place, Nasheed said she wants the state police, health and mental health services to be available. Nasheed said that would give local police help and provide trauma care and diversion programs for children.
""Governor, we must do everything we can to restore a sense of safety, hope and pride for the people who life here,"" she wrote.A spokeswoman for the governor said he had been on the road and unable to review Nasheed's letter. But Parson has met with St. Louis Mayor Lyda Krewson and wants to reduce crime across the state, Kelli Jones said.
""We always appreciate the state’s funding for the ongoing prevention and enforcement efforts that we have,"" Krewson said in a statement. Her spokeswoman, Emily Thenhaus, said she could not clarify whether Krewson thought the city needed more resources from the state.Under Missouri law, the governor or the Legislature can declare a state of emergency if it ""finds that a natural or man-made disaster of major proportions has actually occurred"" and ""that the safety and welfare of the inhabitants of this state require"" such a declaration.While chief executives typically declare states of emergency for natural disasters, President Donald Trump last year declared a ""public health emergency"" in regard to opioid addiction, which was designed to loosen up federal resources to help deal with the epidemic. Former Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon, a Democrat, declared a state of emergency as protests roiled Ferguson in 2014.Former Gov. Eric Greitens, a Republican who resigned June 1, activated the Missouri National Guard in anticipation of expected protests in St. Louis last year, but his executive order did not say he was declaring a state of emergency.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Trade tensions send waves through Missouri, offering a possible opening for McCaskill","Jun 24, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/business/local/trade-tensions-send-waves-through-missouri-offering-a-possible-opening/article_a91850c8-101b-5eaa-84d8-dc7eed166073.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • After Missouri’s new Gov. Mike Parson hosted the state’s congressional delegation earlier this month, U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., was the first to exit his Jefferson City office — and she eagerly approached the reporter scrum gathered in the hallway.“I certainly expressed concerns for the ag community on this looming trade war,” McCaskill said, “and what a devastating impact that could have on Missouri’s economy if all of our export nations begin putting retaliatory tariffs on our ag products.”McCaskill, a Democrat facing re-election this year, may have spotted an opening as she tries to appeal to rural voters in an increasingly red state. Escalating trade tension had sent shock waves through the state’s agricultural and manufacturing sectors and could affect voters who propelled President Donald Trump to Washington.

Attorney General Josh Hawley, her likely Republican opponent, has generally embraced Trump’s abrasive tactics, arguing that the long-term outcome of Trump’s negotiations could outweigh any short-term harm.McCaskill’s campaign said Friday that Hawley continued to “stand by the president’s trade war,” while Hawley’s campaign complained that McCaskill has “politicized” the issue and “ignored farm interests here for years.”The daylight between the two candidates could offer contrasts for voters this November, if both candidates win their party primaries.“She (McCaskill) has to have decent support from rural Missouri in order to have a chance,” said Terry Smith, political science professor at Columbia College. “From a political point of view, the timing of the impact is important. ... Will it kick in in time to potentially impact the ‘18 elections?”China, one of the main targets of Trump’s trade moves, is Missouri’s third-largest trading partner behind Canada and Mexico, with the state exporting $926 million worth of goods to the country last year.The worries among Missouri’s agricultural and business people started in March when Trump announced steep tariffs on imported aluminum and steel.While the country’s steel and aluminum producers cheered the new barriers, consumers of the materials — including farmers purchasing equipment — worried about increased prices. And in response, China slapped tariffs on American goods, including pork, a key Missouri agricultural export.














        
            Citing Trump tariffs, U.S. Steel to bring back 500 workers in Granite City

U.S. Steel restarting one of two blast furnaces less than a week after President Trump announced tariffs on imported steel. 




On Wednesday, McCaskill joined a bipartisan group of lawmakers critical of the aluminum and steel tariffs during a Senate hearing. She said Mid Continent Nail Corp. in Poplar Bluff, Mo., had laid off 60 employees due to rising prices.“The 25 percent tariff on the wire we use to make our nails is pricing us out of the market,” George Skarich, Mid Continent’s executive vice president for sales, said in a news release sent out by McCaskill’s office. “Cheap nail imports from China and other countries don’t face this tariff and are increasing every day. We need our wire to be excluded from this tariff or we will have to increase the layoffs we’ve already begun.”According to a March report by the Brookings Institution, 5 percent of the state’s total imports are made up of aluminum and steel, meaning Missouri is more reliant on the imports than is the country as a whole.
“We could be at the forefront of feeling some of those negative effects,” said Dan Mehan, president of the Missouri Chamber of Commerce and Industry, “until, I hope, they (the tensions) resolve themselves.“It’s going to be a disruption right now,” he added.While a bipartisan group of lawmakers — including Missouri’s Republican U.S. Sen. Roy Blunt — expressed concern over those tariffs in March, Hawley expressed support for Trump’s moves on steel and aluminum.“Trade is good for Missouri workers and farmers when our trade partners follow the same rules we do,” he said then. “Most of our trade partners do. But one in particular doesn’t: China. China systematically abuses the global trade system, and we should respond firmly to defend American workers.”
Earlier this month, the United States moved forward with tariffs on $50 billion on Chinese goods, which target a slew of products ranging from ball bearings to agricultural machinery. China responded immediately, announcing tariffs on $50 billion in American goods, including on soybeans.The U.S. is expected to start imposing the tariffs on July 6, with China expected to follow suit in retaliation.On Friday, soybean futures were trading at $8.94 per bushel at the market’s close, down from $10.76 on March 2, according to the RMB Group.Patrick Westhoff, director of the Food and Agricultural Policy Research Institute at the University of Missouri, said several factors had reduced the price of soybeans recently, including trade tension and the expectation of a healthy crop this year.“The combination of expecting a big crop and expecting reduced demand from China has really put a hammer on soybean prices,” he told the Post-Dispatch.When asked last week if his concern over the United States’ international disputes had intensified, Blake Hurst, a corn and soybean farmer and president of the Missouri Farm Bureau, said: “I think it would be fair to say that I’m becoming more concerned as time goes on.“Clearly, tariffs on steel from China increase the cost of the things farmers buy,” he added. “Retaliatory tariffs put in place by China will reduce the price of the things we sell. It’s that simple.”In response to a Post-Dispatch inquiry, Hawley said in a statement that Trump “is right to take a strong approach to shake up our trade posture” in regard to China.Trump said last week’s tariffs would prevent “further unfair transfers of American technology and intellectual property to China, which will protect American jobs.”“I’ve said this throughout the process: We’ll judge his tactics by the deal he gets,” Hawley said. “I am against anything that hurts Missouri farmers, and I’ve been in talks with our agriculture community about this.”

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Parson signs law setting up funds for radioactive waste probe,"Jun 22, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/parson-signs-law-setting-up-funds-for-radioactive-waste-probe/article_5962ba0a-6ac9-5d82-941a-fdad2212d872.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Missouri’s new governor signed legislation Friday aimed at providing state funding to help investigate areas of the state exposed to radioactive waste.Republican Gov. Mike Parson, who was sworn in on June 1 after the resignation of Gov. Eric Greitens, approved the proposal championed by Sen. Maria Chappelle-Nadal, D-University City.The measure will allocate $150,000 annually to the Department of Natural Resources to probe sites like the West Lake Landfill in north St. Louis County, where radioactive material was dumped more than 40 years ago.

“It’s a small step for a big problem. There’s a lot more that needs to happen,” Chappelle-Nadal said. “We’ve got a long road ahead of us.”The measure was among the first five bills signed by Parson, who had previously served as lieutenant governor.“Our top objective is to move Missouri forward. Today, by signing these bills into law, we are headed the right direction. The Legislature should be proud of the work that was done this year. Many significant bills were passed during this very productive session,” Parson said in a written statement.Before hastily leaving office under the cloud of a growing scandal, Greitens signed 77 bills into law, leaving Parson with nearly the same number to act on. The new governor is expected to sign the state’s $27.8 billion budget into law next week.Chappelle-Nadal said she was pleasantly surprised Parson signed the legislation because the two had locked horns over the years. He previously served in the Senate and also presided over the chamber as lieutenant governor.In September, after Chappelle-Nadal had written on Facebook that she hoped President Donald Trump would be assassinated, Parson called for her ouster from the Senate.
“I have no desire to sit in the same chamber with an elected official who has called for the assassination of the president of the United States,” Parson said.Chappelle-Nadal removed the post and apologized but was stripped of her committee assignments by Senate Minority Leader Gina Walsh, D-Bellefontaine Neighbors.The signing of the legislation comes on the same week that a federal report was issued saying people who lived near or played in Coldwater Creek from the 1960s to the 1990s may have been exposed to radioactive contaminants, increasing their risk of developing cancer.
Chappelle-Nadal has been pushing for tougher laws aimed at addressing World War II-era weapon production that resulted in nuclear waste being dumped at sites near the St. Louis Lambert International Airport.The radioactive waste fund was just one provision of a larger bill affecting state environmental laws.The legislation, for example, also would alter the state’s regulation of coal ash, the residue left after coal is burned to generate electricity.The ash typically is stored in water pits that, if not properly lined and monitored, can leak unwanted metals and chemicals into groundwater supplies.The changes included in Senate Bill 782 were backed by Ameren Missouri and other investor-owned utilities. It gives the DNR the authority to make rules and approve target levels for the management, closure and post-closure of the coal ash repositories.Other legislation approved by Parson on Friday includes House Bill 1831, which adds disposable diapers to the sales tax holiday that occurs in early August.

Mike Parson says his first meeting with President Donald Trump was a productive one.The state’s new governor, a Republican like Trump, was in Washington Thursday for a lunch with the president and discussions with Cabinet-level officials.In a statement released afterward, Parson said he and a group of eight other governors discussed issues including infrastructure improvement and workforce development.

“It’s important that we discuss best practices to tackle shared challenges and priorities. In order to continue our strong economic growth, we must address our infrastructure needs, ensure our workforce is ready, and remove job-killing regulations,” Parson said.Parson also met with the heads of the U.S. Department of Labor, the Department of Transportation and with senior officials from the U.S. Department of Commerce and the Small Business Administration.Parson took over as Missouri governor on June 1 after the abrupt resignation of scandal-plagued then-Gov. Eric Greitens.
Parson, who had served as lieutenant governor since January 2017, has said fixing the state’s roads and bridges would be a key part of his role as chief executive.And, like his predecessor, he has said bringing more jobs to the state is important.
The visit to Washington comes after Parson has met with federal, state and local officials in Missouri as he ramps up his fledgling administration. On Wednesday, Parson met with representatives from top area employers, including from Mercy Hospital, Schnuck Markets, Boeing and Washington University.He also met for the second time with St. Louis County Executive Steve Stenger.Parson was scheduled to return to Missouri later Thursday.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Editorial: Now's the time for Gov. Mike Parson to show Missourians what kind of leader he is,"Jun 21, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-now-s-the-time-for-gov-mike-parson-to/article_7b07b490-478f-59c8-ae84-475b48a6179f.html,"Opportunity is knocking for Gov. Mike Parson. Possibilities abound at this moment in his new tenure to show Missourians what sort of leader he will be. He could have followed in the footsteps of many governors, religious leaders and both Missouri U.S. senators and publicly denounced the Trump administration’s misguided policy on separating migrant children from their families. Instead, he stayed largely silent until Trump decided Wednesday to reverse his policy.Parson and other governors met with Trump on Thursday at the White House, but few observers expected the governor to venture any face-to-face challenge to Trump. He has never been a maverick, but when he sees something happening that he knows to be wrong, he must summon the strength to speak out boldly.Parson gave a hint of what Missouri voters can expect of his leadership by appointing Sen. Mike Kehoe, R-Jefferson City, to be the state’s lieutenant governor. We have no quarrel with Kehoe, a respected and experienced lawmaker whose former position as chairman of the state Highway and Transportation Commission fits well with Parson’s agenda of fixing Missouri’s roads.

But in making the appointment, Parson brushed aside questions about whether he actually had the authority to do so. The Missouri Democratic Party has filed suit challenging the appointment and seeking a court order for an election. Missouri elects its lieutenant governor separately from the governor, and state law is unclear on the governor’s power to fill the vacancy by appointment.If Parson cares whether voters have a say, he doesn’t show it. Does that tell us something about him politically? Or does it merely say he seized an opportunity for expediency?
The governor has many issues important to Missourians that Trump needed to hear during Thursday’s White House meeting, mainly involving new tariffs that threaten to wreak havoc on Missouri soybean farmers and pork producers.
It takes guts to tell the president things he doesn’t want to hear. Other governors announced before Wednesday’s policy reversal that they would no longer send their National Guard troops to assist with Trump’s border-security operations. Parson instead chose to keep a symbolic contingent of four Missouri Army National Guard troops in place.Parson has cleared up concerns about his views on gay rights after having suggested last year that he believed gay people go to hell. “I don’t believe in discrimination against anyone,” he said at a recent gathering in Springfield. Parson went on to explain that he does not believe in a gay life but that people who do should be free from discrimination, the Springfield News-Leader reported.He’s in a tough new job with enormous political challenges. Parson can use this opportunity to lead with authority, or he can settle disappointingly for a mere caretaker role."

Mike Parson paid a quick visit to the St. Louis area on Wednesday for a 30-minute closed-door conversation with St. Louis County Executive Steve Stenger and St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar.In comments to reporters after the meeting, the leaders offered few specifics about their discussion, other than that they discussed public safety, workforce development and appointments to the Bi-State Development Board. Parson and Stenger took questions for nine minutes.

It was the second meeting between Stenger and Parson since the governor was sworn in on June 1; Stenger and St. Louis Mayor Lyda Krewson met with Parson in Jefferson City on June 6.Parson said he wanted to “continue the meeting we had in Jeff City.” He said it was “good to hear the chief talk about some of the initiatives that they started, some of the things they are putting in place with crime rates here.”He said they also talked about workforce development and jobs. “We want to be part of this region of the state, and it’s important for me to get out and be here to see what their concerns are and how we can work together.”Asked if there were specific projects that he discussed with Stenger, Parson said that, with regard to workforce development, he was “trying to learn some of the things they are doing good here in this county that we may be able to transfer some of the positive things that are happening maybe to the state level” and vice versa.“There’s a lot of programs out there across the state and I think one of the goals we have is how do we unite these programs, or how do we consolidate them, to where everybody gets use of them. So that’s some of the things we are talking about today.”
Stenger said it was a “very productive meeting” and that he was grateful for Parson’s visit.“One of the things we talked about was Proposition P and all of the various things we’ve done with Proposition P, adding two officers to a vehicle, what we’ve been able to do from a retention standpoint and an attraction standpoint for officers. And we talked about the state of public safety in St. Louis County.”
Parson said the leaders discussed the appointment process for the Bi-State Development Agency board. Stenger and Krewson have previously said they would urge Parson to quickly appoint new Missouri members for the 10-member Bi-State board. Parson said that he would take action on that “in the near future.”Asked for a reaction to the lawsuit by the state Democratic party over his appointment of Mike Kehoe to lieutenant governor, Parson said, “Well, I think they’re wrong. … I think it was important to make that appointment, and I think I had every ability to do that under the constitution and the laws of … Missouri.”Parson is heading to Washington on Thursday to have lunch with a group of governors and President Donald Trump. A reporter asked whether he would consider pulling back the Missouri National Guard from the Mexican border because of the Trump administration’s policy of separating migrant children from their families in detention.“I want to support the security of the border, that’s something I’ve done my entire career … but none of us want to see families split up,” Parson said.He said “more importantly with that meeting tomorrow, I want to talk about some things that are occurring in Missouri. We just met earlier with Boeing, for example. I want to talk about things like that, how do we get these contracts and how do we get jobs here in the states? We’re interested in what we can do, and what he might be doing, infrastructure-wise, in the near future if he can give us a heads-up on that.”

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Parson says bidding for Medicaid contract not `rigged',"Jun 20, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/parson-says-bidding-for-medicaid-contract-not-rigged/article_de3c3ed3-499a-5fed-a2f2-373c688e0a16.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Missouri Gov. Mike Parson says he believes there was no wrongdoing involving a $2.7 million bid being awarded to a company that formerly employed the state’s chief operating officer.In comments Wednesday during a stop in St. Louis, Parson acknowledged the contract for a review of state Medicaid services was being protested, but said he believes it was handled correctly.“I'm not aware of anything that was rigged or anything like that,” Parson said.

At issue is a six-month contract that was awarded earlier this month to McKinsey & Co.  Former Gov. Eric Greitens’ handpicked COO, Drew Erdmann, worked for the global consulting firm before taking on his state duties.But, according to Parson and the Office of Administration, which oversees the purchasing of products and services for the state, Erdmann has no direct role in the state bidding process.“There was no ties between Drew Erdmann and that company still that we're aware of,” Parson said.The contract, first reported by Post-Dispatch columnist Tony Messenger, became fodder for Democrats, who said the bidding process had been “rigged” in order to steer the contract to McKinsey.House Minority Leader Gail McCann Beatty, D-Kansas City, called on Parson to end the contract and fire Erdmann.“To protect the interests of Missouri taxpayers, I respectfully request that you immediately place this contract on hold pending a full and open review into whether standard bidding rules were followed,” McCann Beatty wrote in a letter to Parson Tuesday.The dust-up is one of the first Parson has had to face since taking over for Greitens on June 1 after the former governor resigned amid multiple scandals. McCann Beatty said it would be best for Parson to cut ties with Erdmann.
“Confidence in state government has been shaken by the many misdeeds and missteps of your predecessor, and you are charged with the unenviable yet vital task of restoring Missourians’ trust in their government. That task will be significantly more difficult if they believe the current administration is turning a blind eye to potential malfeasance,” McCann Beatty wrote.In all, five companies bid for the contract, including Accenture, Deloitte Consulting, KPMG and Navigant. McKinsey received perfect scores for its proposed methodology and its team's qualifications, while the other bidders fared poorly in those areas.
McKinsey received a low score when it came to cost. Only one bidder, Accenture, was slightly higher. The other three were less than half of what McKinsey will receive.Navigant is appealing the contract, saying it should be rescinded and rebid. A timeline for the appeal was not available Wednesday, but Karen Boeger, director of the division of purchasing for the Office of Administration said that the percentage of contracts that are successfully overturned is relatively small.In an interview with reporters Wednesday, Office of Administration Commissioner Sarah Steelman was adamant that Erdmann played no role in the contracting process.“There was no outside influences on this bid  or any bid,” Steelman said.She also defended Erdmann for his role in trying to streamline state government.“He’s a huge asset to the state,” she said.Jeremy Kohler of the Post-Dispatch contributed to this report.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Editorial: In key Sunshine Law case, Republican politics prevails over transparency","Jun 20, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-in-key-sunshine-law-case-republican-politics-prevails-over/article_1d829cfb-8b13-5ddb-8283-90320ef34880.html,"Disgraced former Gov. Eric Greitens might be out of office, but his administration’s legacy of skirting the law lives on. A St. Louis attorney claims to have uncovered clear evidence that Greitens’ aides used the Confide app to discuss government business, effectively evading compliance with Missouri’s Sunshine Law.Confide is designed to automatically delete text messages after they’ve been read by their recipient. The Sunshine Law requires government officials to retain copies of written communications about official business. Plaintiff’s attorney Mark Pedroli correctly argues that an app used to destroy government communications violates the Sunshine Law, and that Greitens administration officials who used Confide for such purposes deserve to answer for their actions in court.Many state Republican leaders, embarrassed by the damage inflicted on the party by Greitens’ multiple scandals, wish this entire issue would just go away. Pedroli says the Republican judge in the case, Cole County Circuit Judge Jon Beetem, appears to be doing his best to make the case disappear. “He’s completely handcuffed me — shut me down,” Pedroli told us Tuesday. (He later said his remarks were meant to be directed at Gov. Mike Parson's office for continuing to argue the legal approach taken by Greitens against allowing discovery in the case.)

The lawsuit also is keeping Republican Attorney General Josh Hawley on the defensive. Before Greitens’ resignation, Hawley’s office conducted a half-hearted investigation into use of Confide by the governor and his staff, but concluded that no wrongdoing occurred. Subsequent revelations have suggested otherwise, providing ample fodder in the Democratic Party’s efforts to derail Hawley’s election bid for the U.S. Senate.The evidence Pedroli produced on Tuesday indicates that, with a bit more digging, Hawley might have uncovered evidence of wrongdoing and avoided charges that he soft-pedaled the investigation. Hawley’s office counters that he wanted to be more aggressive but lacked the subpoena power he needed.
Among items that Pedroli said he received in a “document dump” from the governor’s office are two screenshots. The first is a text exchange between Greitens’ staffers Brad Green and Jeff Earl depicting a draft document titled “PDMP — Talking Points.”
Green complains in the text, “Haha nice! Also, I can’t see your edits very well on confide.” In the second text, Earl resends the document, saying, “Here you go. Thanks!” Green acknowledges receiving it.The document apparently involves a prescription drug monitoring program proposed by Greitens. The mention of using Confide belies assertions by Greitens’ office that no official business was conducted using the app.Beetem had previously been receptive to the plaintiffs’ court challenge, rejecting an April attempt by the governor’s office to get the case dismissed. Beetem was particularly critical of the government’s claim that the use of Confide somehow excused compliance with the Sunshine Law.His ruling Tuesday marks a setback for government transparency. It makes it more difficult to document Sunshine Law violations and force government employees to answer questions about potential violations. Handcuffs or no, Pedroli should keep at it."
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri's new lieutenant governor says he's moving forward despite lawsuit,"Jun 20, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-s-new-lieutenant-governor-says-he-s-moving-forward/article_c3d7d675-503f-5819-8f68-7934d65e1a04.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Missouri’s new lieutenant governor said he’s moving forward with his duties despite a pending lawsuit seeking to rescind his appointment.Former Senate Majority Floor Leader Mike Kehoe, who was sworn into office Monday, said Wednesday it was not surprising that Democrats filed a lawsuit seeking to nullify the action taken by Gov. Mike Parson.“I think most people thought something would come forward,” said Kehoe, a 56-year-old Jefferson City Republican.

Hours after Parson named Kehoe to the post Parson had held since January 2017, the Missouri Democratic Party filed a lawsuit targeting the legal and constitutional questions that surround the ability of a chief executive to fill a vacancy in the lieutenant governor’s office.“Governor Parson is without legal authority to appoint a Lieutenant Governor,” the suit asserts.Parson, also a Republican, moved into the top spot on June 1 after the abrupt resignation of then- Gov. Eric Greitens. Kehoe believes Parson’s advisers gave him the right advice on filling the lieutenant governor vacancy.“I don’t think he would have made the decision to appoint and I wouldn’t have made the decision to accept if I didn’t think he had a pretty good legal team advising him on this,”
Kehoe, who was term limited and set to exit the Legislature in December, is set to serve the remainder of the term, which ends in January 2021.
“I had no absolute thought of becoming a longtime politician,” said Kehoe, a former car salesman and small business owner. “I was ready to be done in December of 2018 and go back and do one of my business careers.”For now, Kehoe and his staff remain in his Senate suite on the Capitol's 3rd floor. But, he said that’s not because of the uncertainty surrounding the lawsuit.Rather, he said the lieutenant governor’s office on the 2nd floor is being painted and won’t be ready for at least a week.Since taking over, Kehoe has spoken with state, federal and local officials, including St. Louis Mayor Lyda Krewson. “The courts will decide and I’m going to just keep doing what I’m doing,” Kehoe said.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri Democrats file suit challenging appointment of lieutenant governor,"Jun 20, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-democrats-file-suit-challenging-appointment-of-lieutenant-governor/article_6bcdc427-b227-5760-83b7-2e48a96eebc0.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Just hours after Gov. Mike Parson appointed a former colleague to the No. 2 post in state government, the Missouri Democratic Party filed a lawsuit seeking to require that the lieutenant governor position be filled only by an election.Seizing on legal and constitutional questions that surround the ability of a chief executive to fill a vacancy in the lieutenant governor’s office, the Democrats and lead plaintiff Darrell Cope of Hartville are asking a Cole County judge to block Sen. Mike Kehoe’s appointment and to give voters the chance to elect the next lieutenant governor.Cope, a World War II veteran, argues that he has standing to sue because one of the lieutenant governor’s duties is to serve as an advocate for veterans.

“I fought Nazis in World War II to defend our freedoms, including our freedom to elect our leaders,” Cope said in a written statement. “I don’t need Republican politicians picking the state Veterans Advocate in back room deals. I want an opportunity to vote for my Lieutenant Governor, and as a World War II combat veteran I’ve earned that right.”Parson, a Republican former senator who was elected lieutenant governor in 2016, moved into the top spot on June 1 after the abrupt resignation of then- Gov. Eric Greitens. In an announcement Monday, Parson was flanked by two attorneys as he said he had the legal ability to appoint Kehoe, 56, R-Jefferson City .In the lawsuit, Democrats say the appointment should be nullified.“Governor Parson is without legal authority to appoint a Lieutenant Governor,” the suit asserts.Parson spokeswoman Kelli Jones said the governor was confident the appointment would be upheld.“Missouri’s constitution is clear in granting gubernatorial authority, and includes a mandate, to fill the vacancy of the lieutenant governor. Former governors of both parties have articulated the exact same position,” Jones said Tuesday.Kehoe did not respond to a request for comment.
Parson’s appointment followed an attempt in the Legislature this spring to enact a law that would allow a governor to appoint a lieutenant governor if the post becomes vacant.The effort was approved in the Senate but rejected by the House.The legislation would have clarified what has become a disagreement among legal experts and lawmakers on whether a Missouri governor has the power to fill the vacancy.On Monday morning, former Gov. Jay Nixon, a Democrat, released a statement in support of Parson’s ability to name a replacement lieutenant governor. Nixon served as attorney general before being elected governor in 2008.
“As Attorney General and later Governor, I researched this issue extensively and firmly believe the Governor has the authority to fill a vacancy in this office by appointment,” Nixon wrote.Former Missouri Supreme Court Chief Justice Michael Wolff, however, told the Post-Dispatch Monday that there was no law authorizing the governor to appoint, nor the voters to elect, a person to serve as lieutenant governor to fill a vacancy in the office.Democratic Party Chairman Stephen Webber chided Parson for a vote on legislation in 2013 that would have required the lieutenant governor post to be filled through an election. That legislation, which also was backed by Kehoe, was vetoed by Nixon.“Veterans like Darrell have earned the right to choose their own leaders by voting,” Webber said. “As a state senator, Mike Parson voted to hold an election in this exact situation. It’s disappointing that Parson is willing to abandon his beliefs to grab more power for his political buddies.”Not all Democrats were critical of Kehoe’s appointment.Senate Minority Leader Gina Walsh, D-Bellefontaine Neighbors, and Assistant Minority Floor Leader Shalonn “Kiki” Curls, D-Kansas City, issued statements supporting Kehoe’s new role.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri Gov. Mike Parson to meet President Trump in Washington,"Jun 19, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-gov-mike-parson-to-meet-president-trump-in-washington/article_f10d255b-aed0-541d-b622-9dca0a388fb4.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Missouri Gov. Mike Parson is making his first trek as the state’s new chief executive to the nation’s capital Thursday.Gov. Mike Parson, who stepped into the vacancy created by the June 1 resignation of fellow Republican Eric Greitens, is scheduled to have lunch with a group of governors and President Donald Trump on Tuesday, as well as discuss transportation and other issues with Cabinet officials, aides told the Post-Dispatch Tuesday.Parson is scheduled to meet with Secretary of Labor R. Alexander Acosta as well as Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao on Thursday. He also is meeting with top officials in the Department of Commerce and the Small Business Administration, Parson's office said.

Parson, who had served as lieutenant governor since January 2017, has made infrastructure improvement a key talking point in his first two weeks in the governor's office. He has said the state needs to find a solution to help fix its roads and bridges, which could include an increase in the gasoline tax.In addition, he appointed former Sen. Mike Kehoe as lieutenant governor. Kehoe previously served as chairman of the Missouri Highways and Transportation Commission.Members of Missouri's congressional delegation also raised concerns about the impact of growing trade tensions on the state's agricultural exports with Parson during a 30-minute meeting in Jefferson City last week.The visit to Washington comes as at least three governors have vowed to not deploy any National Guard resources to the border until the Trump administration stops separating migrant children from their parents as part of border patrol efforts.
Along with Republican Govs. Larry Hogan of Maryland and Charlie Baker of Massachusetts, Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo of Rhode Island also has said she would not send troops.In May, acting on a request from the Trump administration, Greitens deployed four Missouri Army National Guard troops and a helicopter to Arizona to help with border protection.Parson's office did not respond to an inquiry about the status of that deployment Tuesday.
The soldiers are expected to return to Missouri mid-summer.The governor's Washington visit will come after a Wednesday trip to St. Louis, where Parson is meeting with representatives from top area employers, including from Mercy Hospital, Schnuck Markets, Boeing and Washington University.He is also scheduled to meet with St. Louis County Executive Steve Stenger and the Regional Business Council.During his 17 months as governor, Greitens traveled to Washington at least five times for meetings with Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and events organized by the Republican Governors Association.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Long wait for adoptees seeking birth records in Missouri,"Jun 18, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/long-wait-for-adoptees-seeking-birth-records-in-missouri/article_06c66629-1778-531c-9f8e-786d6aa29fa7.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • A law enacted two years ago to help adoptees in Missouri track down copies of their birth records is being dogged by delays.Although the Department of Health and Senior Services previously warned adoptees that they might face up to a six-month wait, the delay now is stretching to the nine-month mark.More than 3,000 adoptees are affected by the delay, and some are expressing frustration.

“It’s unbelievable,” said Gerelyn Hollingsworth Weil, a St. Louis resident who was adopted in 1942. She has been waiting for her records since January.“Five months is a long time to wait, after a lifetime of waiting for sealed records to be made available to the people they’re about,” Weil told the Post-Dispatch.Michelle Newell of the Adoption Triad Support Connection of St. Louis said the two-person staff at the agency was not enough to keep up with the demand.“The state of Missouri didn’t expect the abundance of people filing requests for their records,” Newell said Monday.In 2016, then-Gov. Jay Nixon signed the Missouri Adoptee Rights Act, which allows adopted Missourians over the age of 18 to have access to their birth certificates.Previously, a person needed a court order to request the original birth certificate.The measure was praised by adoptee rights groups, who viewed it as a way for adoptees to determine whether they could face health issues because of their genetics.Opponents argued that women who put their children up for adoption were made a promise of confidentiality at the time.The new law came in two phases.Last August, adoptees born before 1941 were given access to their original birth records. In January, those born after 1941 were given the ability to access them too.To make a request, an adoptee must complete an application, pay a $15 fee and have the paperwork notarized unless it is submitted in person to the vital records office in Jefferson City.Megan Hopkins, spokeswoman for the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services, said 848 individuals had been provided with a copy of their original birth certificate or notified that the agency did not have a record on file for them.As of June 11, there was a backlog of 3,480 requests for original birth certificates. Some of those include applications that contain insufficient information to identify a record, applications that are being researched, and applications waiting to be researched, Hopkins said.
“These requests are being diligently researched in a first-in, first-out manner,” she added.One problem could be a lack of adequate staffing at the agency. Hopkins said no additional funding nor employees were included in the budget to comply with the new law.On its website, the agency says adoptees should allow three to six months from the date of submitting an application to receive the records “due to the demand for these records and the research required to find and process these records.”Now, Hopkins said, the wait could be longer.
“We are currently estimating six to nine months as the wait time for an adoptee to receive a copy of their original birth certificate,” she said.“That’s infuriating,” Weil said.Two key proponents of the change in law are urging adoptees to be patient.Rep. Don Phillips, R-Kimberling City, an adoptee who sponsored the legislation, said it was not a question of if, but when people would receive their documents.“They are as shorthanded as can be,” Phillips said. “As it is, they are doing the best they can.”He said he planned to talk with new Gov. Mike Parson about potential solutions, such as hiring additional workers or transferring a current worker into that department.“We’ve even talked about volunteers,” Phillips said. “But that opens other questions, such as privacy issues.”Patti Naumann of the St. Louis adoption triad said early estimates had the waiting period set at about six to eight weeks.But, she said, “The volume of people making requests was much more than anticipated.”And, Naumann added, workers shouldn’t be rushed to fulfill applications.“I think the state is very concerned that the process is flawless. They don’t want to release incorrect information. I think they are doing the best they can,” Naumann said.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Even a steak chalupa then-Gov. Eric Greitens ordered last year drew scrutiny from Missouri AG,"Jun 18, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/even-a-steak-chalupa-then-gov-eric-greitens-ordered-last/article_4462444a-5034-5aef-abe6-b8272a240cc9.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • In April of last year, then-Gov. Eric Greitens rode with a Lyft driver to a Taco Bell, signed legislation loosening restrictions on ride-share companies, and took a bite out of a steak chalupa.“This might be the first bill that has ever been signed in a Lyft car, with a chalupa,” Greitens told his Lyft driver, in a video posted on Greitens’ personal Facebook account and produced by his campaign.

A year later, Attorney General Josh Hawley, a Republican, asked Greitens’ office for a cache of records in an effort to see to what extent Greitens used taxpayer resources to maintain his private social media accounts, which could be a violation of state law if the work was considered political and not official.Among the things Hawley’s general counsel Michael Martinich-Sauter asked for in a May 11 open records request: any emails originating from press secretary Parker Briden or Greitens adviser Jimmy Soni that mention any of 17 search terms.One of the search terms was “chalupas,” according to a copy of the open records request, obtained by the Post-Dispatch through an open records request.The attorney general’s office was also seeking any emails between the governor’s office and Austin Chambers, a top Greitens political adviser, and any emails to C5 Consulting, a now-defunct political shop owned by Vice President Mike Pence’s chief of staff, Nick Ayers.The office also wanted any emails to Greitens’ personal confidants, Mark and Chris Bobak, as well as any emails to the Greitens Group, Greitens’ campaign treasurer Jeff Stuerman, and other campaign-related entities.
“The Sunshine Request related to our investigation into whether the Governor’s Office was using official resources to maintain private social media accounts,” said Mary Compton, spokeswoman for the attorney general’s office. “The search terms in the Sunshine Request were chosen to identify communications in which the Governor’s Office staff may have been drafting private social media posts.”The investigation into Greitens’ social media habits followed reporting from the Kansas City Star raising questions about the legality of Greitens’ taxpayer-funded staff working on Greitens’ personal Facebook page.
Hawley also launched investigations of Greitens’ charitable ties, his use of a text-destroying cellphone application, and other open records-related matters during Greitens’ 17-month tenure.In response to Martinich-Sauter, Greitens’ counsel Lucinda Luetkemeyer wrote on May 16 that the office would be able to provide a cost estimate “in no more than 10 business days.”On June 1, Luetkemeyer wrote again to Martinich-Sauter that the Greitens administration would not provide a cost estimate to the attorney general by the time Greitens left office June 1.“Due to the change in the administration, we are closing your pending records request and have provided it to the incoming administration for review and processing,” Luetkemeyer wrote. “If you wish to resubmit or have questions regarding the consideration of your request, please forward to the new administration.”Compton did not say directly whether Hawley intended to further push the matter, saying in a statement, “Our office intends to pursue and conclude its investigations in an orderly fashion.”Kelli Jones, press secretary for Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican who took over as governor June 1, said the office was not currently processing the request.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Parson picks Jefferson City senator as lieutenant governor,"Jun 18, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/parson-picks-jefferson-city-senator-as-lieutenant-governor/article_7f68e5f4-9e13-559f-844f-b730ea1b9ac6.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Two full weeks after taking over for scandal-plagued Eric Greitens, new Missouri Gov. Mike Parson chose Republican Sen. Mike Kehoe on Monday as his pick for lieutenant governor.Calling the Jefferson City lawmaker steady, predictable and humble, Parson said Kehoe would play a key role in trying to improve the state’s roads and bridges.“The lieutenant governor is an important position, not just because of the duties assigned by Missouri law and the state Constitution, but also to reassure Missourians that all operations of state government will continue,” Parson said.

The majority floor leader of the Missouri Senate had been the leading candidate to fill in for Parson, who took office on June 1 after Greitens’ abrupt resignation amid allegations of sexual misconduct surrounding his extramarital affair and also allegations of campaign finance violations.“When Gov. Parson called and asked me to assist him in this great endeavor, it was one of the most humbling and unbelievable days in my life,” Kehoe said.Kehoe, 56, is a St. Louis native who got his start in state government in 2005, when he was appointed by then-Gov. Matt Blunt to serve on the Missouri Highway and Transportation Commission.He was elected to the Missouri Senate in 2010, representing a district that includes Cole, Callaway, Miller, Moniteau, and Morgan counties. Kehoe is term-limited and cannot run for another term in the upper chamber.In a sign that Kehoe was in line for the promotion, he was seated next to Parson at an event at the University of Missouri-Columbia last week.“Mike is someone who will bring great experience to the Lieutenant Governor’s office as part of this administration. He will provide valuable leadership experience to Missouri as well,” Parson said.Parson said Kehoe would use his role as a former state highway commissioner to help promote the improvement of state infrastructure.“I will do all I can to help him in that area,” Kehoe said.The appointment follows an attempt in the Legislature this spring to enact a law that would allow a governor to appoint a lieutenant governor if the post becomes vacant.The effort was approved in the Senate but was rejected in the House.The legislation would have clarified what has become a disagreement among legal experts and lawmakers on whether a governor has the power to fill the vacancy.In a nod to the potential controversy, Parson was flanked by lawyer Joe Bednar, a Democrat who served as legal counsel for three governors, and Lowell Pearson, a Republican and former chief counsel to Blunt.Both believe Parson has the legal authority to fill the vacancy.
On Monday morning, former Gov. Jay Nixon, a Democrat, released a statement in support of Parson’s ability to name a replacement lieutenant governor. Nixon served as attorney general before being elected governor in 2008.“As Attorney General and later Governor, I researched this issue extensively and firmly believe the Governor has the authority to fill a vacancy in this office by appointment,” Nixon wrote. “In 1992 Missouri voters added significant additional duties to the office that would be unmet if the position remained vacant. Missouri’s unique succession laws could cause constitutional challenges if the Governor becomes disabled when the Lt. Governor’s Office remained vacant.”Former Missouri Supreme Court Chief Justice Michael Wolff, however, said there was no law authorizing the governor to appoint, nor the voters to elect, a person to serve as lieutenant governor to fill a vacancy in the office.“I am not saying the argument on the other side is not legitimate. It’s just weaker,” Wolff said Monday.As majority floor leader, Kehoe served as a traffic cop for legislation being debated on the Senate floor.He stopped short of calling on Greitens to resign after Greitens was indicted on felony invasion of privacy charges in February. But in April, after the Missouri House released a report containing allegations that Greitens had hit, groped and coerced his hair stylist, Kehoe said Greitens had lost the “moral authority” to lead the state.
“Should the governor choose not to resign, I am persuaded that he has not only burned bridges, he has blown them up to where it will be impossible for him to effectively lead the state going forward,” Kehoe said in a statement. “Remaining in office reeks of the self-serving actions of a ‘career politician’ the governor has mockingly derided since his inauguration.”Kehoe’s appointment Monday won bipartisan support.“Sen. Kehoe is highly respected among members of both parties for his honesty and integrity. He will make an excellent Lt. Governor and I look forward to continuing to work with him on issues important to Missouri families,” said Senate Minority Leader Gina Walsh, D-Bellefontaine Neighbors.“As a state Senator, Mike Kehoe was known for his ability to work across the aisle on important issues facing our state. Sen. Kehoe is a fair and hardworking public servant, and I know he will continue to serve the people of Missouri well,” said Assistant Minority Floor Leader Shalonn “Kiki” Curls, D-Kansas City.“Not only is Mike a close colleague, but he is a good friend. I have been fortunate to witness his strong leadership skills and his passion for the Show-Me State. He knows how to communicate with people and listen to both sides,” said Senate President Pro Tem Ron Richard, R-Joplin.Before moving to mid-Missouri, Kehoe sold cars for Dave Sinclair Ford in St. Louis in his early 20s. He later took over Osage Industries, an ambulance manufacturer in Linn.He sold the company to its employees in 1992 and purchased a Ford and Lincoln-Mercury franchise in Jefferson City.Kehoe and his wife, Claudia, have four children. In addition to living in Jefferson City, they own a farm on the Gasconade River in Phelps County.As lieutenant governor, Kehoe will preside over the Senate and, if needed, cast tie-breaking votes on legislation. He also will sit on a number of boards and commissions.As a senator, Kehoe earned $35,900. The lieutenant governor post pays $86,600.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Editorial: Former Gov. Eric Greitens should pay his own legal fees,"Jun 16, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-former-gov-eric-greitens-should-pay-his-own-legal/article_139f9e80-0b6c-53e8-97b8-d3957eef09a6.html,"Two attorneys for former Gov. Eric Greitens, hired to represent him in disciplinary action before the Legislature, were benefiting Greitens and not state taxpayers, says the head of Missouri’s Office of Administration, who is refusing to pay those legal bills. Greitens was responsible for the scandals that erupted on his watch. He must assume responsibility for the resulting costs.Attorneys Ross Garber and Ed Greim submitted $153,000 in bills to the state for legal expenses preceding Greitens’ June 1 resignation. He hired Garber, a Washington, D.C., attorney with expertise defending other governors facing impeachment, for $320 an hour. Greim, a Kansas City-based attorney, billed $340 an hour.Despite objections from the attorneys, Missouri authorities need to stand firm on the decision not to stick taxpayers with this tab. There are potentially more bills that Greitens could try to get paid with state revenue because he still faces a civil lawsuit involving allegations of open records violations. The suit involves Greitens’ and his staff’s use of an app, Confide, that erases text messages after they are read.

Rep. Jay Barnes, R-Jefferson City, who chaired the special Missouri House committee that investigated Greitens, said in a three-page letter to Sarah Steelman, commissioner of the state’s Office of Administration, that the governor broke the law when his office hired the attorneys. Steelman said Thursday that the state would not pay the bills.Barnes said that Greitens individually entered into the contract with the lawyers, violating a state law that forbids officials from making contract decisions from which they personally benefit.
Auditor Nicole Galloway, a Democrat, also says the state should not pay the bills. “The last thing Missourians expect when they send their hard-earned tax dollars to their government is for that money to be used to represent the governor in disciplinary action before the Legislature,” she said.
Republican Attorney General Josh Hawley says Greitens hired the two attorneys unlawfully, and that they were advancing Greitens’ private interests, not those of the governor’s office. A Greitens adviser said part of the reason the governor resigned is because he had millions of dollars in legal bills and would have racked up millions more fighting further legal challenges.Mark Pedroli, an attorney and plaintiff in the Confide lawsuit, told The Kansas City Star that Gov. Mike Parson must decide if the governor’s office “will continue to stonewall or let the investigation go forth.” No matter what Parson decides, the Bryan Cave law firm already has been paid $6,720 from the state’s legal defense fund to represent the governor’s office in that case.Republicans talk a lot about personal responsibility, and this is what it’s all about. The financial mess Greitens created is his own to clear up."
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Cards notebook: Leone 'turns corner' in recovery; Bowman returns,"Jun 16, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/sports/baseball/professional/cards-notebook-leone-turns-corner-in-recovery-bowman-returns/article_376ddccf-f047-5ec7-affd-b1a372672a05.html,"Cardinals reliever Dominic Leone, whose season has been in question because of nerve trouble in his right arm and biceps, met with a specialist this past week and received encouraging news. Leone’s nerve injury has started to show signs of rejuvenation and recovery.“He’s turned the corner from uncertainty to progressing in the right direction,” general manager Michael Girsch said. “It’s going to be a process.”Leone went on the disabled list May 5, and he was moved eventually to the 60-day disabled list because of the longevity of his injury. Acquired from Toronto, the 26-year-old righthander started the season as the Cardinals’ stand-in closer and went 1-2 with a 4.15 ERA in 15 games. When his biceps became an issue, the question for Leone was whether he would pitch again this season for the Cardinals. Now it’s when, Girsch said. Leone has had some atrophying of his arm strength and will need a lengthy program to get back to full health.




BOWMAN BACKWith the return of Matt Bowman on Friday from a blisters issue that put him on the disabled list, the Cardinals had a stocked and refreshed bullpen for the first time in at least a week, but sorting out roles was still what manager Mike Matheny has long called “a work in progress.”“We’ve been pushing these guys pretty hard,” the manager said. “It seems like it’s been multiple games in a row where we’ve had multiple players who were untouchable that night. That creates a challenge. That could end up changing in a hurry if we go one extra-inning game (or) you go a couple of really tight, knock-down, drag-outs, and you put a lot of work on them.”To make room for Bowman on the active roster the Cardinals optioned Daniel Poncedeleon to Class AAA Memphis. He’s the second pitcher this season and third player overall to come to the majors for a promotion and not get an appearance.Austin Gomber, another, has returned in a prominent role.Bowman’s return as a “bridge” reliever to Jordan Hicks and closer Bud Norris could help free Gomber, a lefty, for his assignments as a targeted specialist vs. the Cubs’ lefthanded hitters like Kyle Schwarber, Anthony Rizzo and Jason Heyward. Brett Cecil is the only other active lefty, though several righthanders have had better success against lefthanded batters than him.“I obviously feel good,” Bowman said. “I’m hoping we can make the playoffs, and I’m a little bit fresher. We’ve had a lot of guys on the DL. It stinks now. At some point, there could be some silver lining to that.”INJURY UPDATES
Shortstop Paul DeJong (fractured finger) will have a scan taken of the joint Saturday to determine if he can begin taking batting practice. DeJong has been swinging a bat, tracking pitches, and taking grounders, but he has not been cleared to test the fractured digit by making contact with the bat. Once cleared, he’ll advance as tolerated and stride toward a rehab assignment with a minor-league affiliate.Girsch said DeJong’s recovery could “move quickly” when cleared.Adam Wainwright (elbow) received a platelet-rich plasma injection near his right elbow this past week and has been prescribed several days of rest to allow the treatment to take root and begin to promote healing in the ailing joint. Wainwright is still several weeks away from returning to a throwing program.
Elsewhere: Reliever Greg Holland (hip) had his appearance at Class AA Springfield rained out Thursday night, so he’ll attempt to pitch back-to-back games Friday and Saturday. The righthander will be evaluated based on his results after those two appearances and could return to a minor-league affiliate at that point for another set of innings. Luke Gregerson (knee surgery) and Tyler Lyons (elbow) will begin throwing programs next week while the team takes a road trip to Philadelphia and Milwaukee.JOSE MARTINEZ, ETC.The Cardinals officially placed Jose Martinez on the paternity list Friday a day after he was said to have arrived in Venezuela for the birth of his second child. The Cardinals expect Martinez back in the United States by Sunday night, and he will then join the team in Philadelphia on Monday when his paternity leave ends. … Former Cardinals closer Jason Motte, a World Series champion in 2011, has accepted a position as the director of player development for the University of Memphis’ baseball team. Motte retired after he did not make the Cardinals’ roster out of spring training, and he has since moonlighted on one Facebook broadcast of a game. … The Cardinals are currently voting on All-Stars for next month’s game in Washington. The peer vote selects the pitchers and many of the backup position players for the game.MORE PICKS SIGNThe Cardinals’ finalized deals with 24 more players and have now signed nine of their first 10 selections in this month’s draft. The lone unsigned draft pick from the early rounds is Texas Tech lefty Steven Gingery. The latest wave of deals includes Nick Dunn, Maryland infielder; Edgar Gonzalez, Fresno State righthander; Brendan Donovan, South Alabama infielder; and Lars Nootbaar, an outfielder from Southern Cal.The Cardinals also signed one of the most accomplished Division III starters as an undrafted free agent. Tommy Parsons, a righthander from Adrian College in Michigan, was a three-time Michigan Intercollegeiate Athletic Association pitcher of the year, and he went 11-0 with a save and a 1.72 ERA this past season. He moves on to pro ball as the NCAA all-division leader with 40 wins (and only four losses), and he threw 24 complete games in college.He’ll report to rookie-level Johnson City.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Messenger: Top adviser to new Missouri governor owes nearly $300,000 in back taxes","Jun 15, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/columns/tony-messenger/messenger-top-adviser-to-new-missouri-governor-owes-nearly-in/article_3269ff36-69e6-55b4-aba2-ca9495721902.html,"On the day Gov. Eric Greitens resigned, Republican lobbyist and political consultant James Harris filed paperwork with the Missouri Ethics Commission adding a new client.Perhaps it was a coincidence. Harris said he had actually signed a contract with the company more than a month before.But it was also a signal.

With Lt. Gov. Mike Parson moving into the governor’s mansion, Harris was about to up his profile.A longtime Jefferson City political operative, Harris has Parson’s ear.He was one of his key campaign consultants in the 2016 election and has still been paid a monthly retainer by Parson’s campaign since the election. On the day of Parson’s big move, Harris was the go-to quote about the new governor in newspapers across the country. He was offering advice to Parson and positioning himself as a key player.A bigger payday was on the way.And Harris needs it.The top adviser to the new governor owes nearly $300,000 in tax debt to the federal government.In April last year, the Internal Revenue Service placed a lien on the Jefferson City home owned by Harris and his wife for more than $142,000 in back taxes. In January of this year, the IRS placed a second lien, this one for more than $222,000.In an interview, Harris confirmed the debt.“I’m getting a loan and will have it paid off in two to three weeks,” he said. “I, like other business people, sometimes make mistakes. I have a liability and I’m making payments.”The debt, according to documents Harris shared with the Post-Dispatch, is down to $295,000.The tax debts are from 2015 and 2016. And they aren’t the first time the lobbyist and political consultant has faced such a debt.In 2014, Harris paid off nearly $175,000 in debt from tax years 2009 and 2010.He declined to describe the circumstances that led to the unpaid taxes.
But, he said, “I understand the concern.”If Harris is to have an influence in the new governor’s administration, either as a consultant or a lobbyist, having such a debt could be a magnet to bad actors seeking undue influence in the new Parson Administration.It is not — minus the Russian meddling and federal investigation — unlike the situation of New York attorney Michael Cohen, who after Donald Trump became president became the go-to person for advice from corporations on how to influence the new president.In short order, Cohen accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars in payments from American corporations seeking his advice and guidance in the Age of Trump.It is not unusual in Missouri for certain lobbyists to gain favor as an administration turns. In fact, the last time there was a big controversy about a close aide to the governor steering lobbying contracts to a specific firm, Harris was involved.In 2006, Harris was the appointments director for Gov. Matt Blunt. It’s a gatekeeper role that helps determine which donors and other people get positions in the administration. At the time, Harris was accused of shepherding lucrative contracts to lobbyist Jewell Patek, who employed Harris’ fiancée, Jillian Lair. They are now married. Harris was also implicated in allegations that he was influencing the awarding of driver’s license fee-office contracts to his allies.
One of those allies, state Rep. Nathan Cooper, R-Cape Girardeau, had paid Harris’ $10,000 in consulting fees around the same time some of Cooper’s law clients received fee-office contracts. Harris and Cooper met at St. Louis University, where they both attended college.Cooper later pleaded guilty to immigration fraud and served a year in federal prison.He’s out now, and on the day Parson was elevated to the governor’s chair, Cooper was on the phone with his old friend, Harris, offering advice.The old gang was back together.The FBI investigated the fee-office scheme in 2006. No charges were brought.But amid the allegations that year, Harris resigned from his position with the governor’s office. He started his new firm, the J. Harris Co., that month.Harris told me the Parson administration was not aware of his debt.Through a spokesman, the governor’s office confirmed that it was “completely unaware” of Harris’ tax debt. The governor’s office said it would seek counsel to develop standards to remove potential conflicts of interest in the future.Harris played down his influence with Parson, despite still being on the campaign payroll.“I have not been in the Capitol office since he took over,” Harris said. “He has an excellent team around him.”

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Greitens era brought big change that could linger at Department of Natural Resources,"Jun 15, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/business/local/greitens-era-brought-big-change-that-could-linger-at-department/article_4579e13e-c915-5e6f-b568-9f2dbcc184cb.html,"New Missouri Gov. Mike Parson is keeping department heads and other appointees from his resigned predecessor, Eric Greitens, in place.One department where that continuity in leadership could hold significance is at the Missouri Department of Natural Resources — an agency where Greitens’ tenure heralded some key changes in policy.In its year and a half under Greitens, the DNR emphasized aggressive reduction of backlogged permits, proposed amending or altogether rescinding dozens of environmental regulations, and initiated talks to take over additional enforcement and oversight responsibilities from regional Environmental Protection Agency officials — all while experiencing cuts to the department’s overall size and budget.

Parson intends to meet with DNR officials in the next week or two for his first detailed discussion of agency policy since he was sworn in, according to a DNR spokeswoman. But Director Carol Comer has already been asked to stay at the helm of the department, and no personnel changes are anticipated.Perhaps the defining Greitens-era policy shift at the DNR has been the implementation of “red tape reduction” efforts that have reversed hundreds of stalled permit applications — some years or even decades old — and accelerated the process of granting new ones.“If you haven’t heard the term ‘red tape reduction’ from the state of Missouri, you haven’t been paying attention,” said Kyra Moore, deputy director of the DNR’s Department of Environmental Quality, in remarks at the Midwest Environmental Compliance Conference in Kansas City this April.Regulatory reduction efforts are also reflected by proposed changes — and rescissions — of existing guidelines for air and water quality and for solid waste management. The rationale behind some of the moves is that the policies are obsolete because there are no sources of given pollutants, or that those sources have gone out of business. It was not immediately clear what might happen if certain activities in question were to resume.But the DNR has also reached beyond its own walls and stacks of backlogs to seek change. Last year, new DNR officials reached out to EPA Region 7 officials to “revisit and clarify (their) respective roles” and, in a “significantly different direction from the past,” asked that “Region 7 step back from its routine practice of conducting individual inspections and taking enforcement actions in Missouri.” The agency said it would review all areas where EPA involvement seemed to exceed “a normal audit function.”“We didn’t say, ‘Get the hell out of our state,’ but it was, ‘Hey, we think we can handle this,’” said Ed Galbraith, the DNR’s Division of Environmental Quality director, in April. “All states have these conversations, some are more direct than others. I’m not aware of another state that sent a letter that’s as broad as ours.”Indeed, Missouri is the only one of the four states within EPA Region 7 to have initiated such a conversation, regional EPA administrator Jim Gulliford recently told the Post-Dispatch.Officials from both the DNR and Region 7 met in February to discuss transferring areas of regulatory oversight, with a plan to assess any switches after six months or so. When asked, neither agency could provide details about what specific responsibilities have switched — or will switch — hands.
Both agencies insist that the change will not coincide with reduced environmental protection.“The idea that there’s somehow going to be a race to the bottom doesn’t exist at all,” said Gulliford. “All the federal statutes — Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, Safe Drinking Water Act — all those things remain the same.... So we have the same requirement in terms of providing assurance to the public that we’re meeting those.”Mixed response 
""It is a thing to be applauded,"" said Todd Houts, director of Environmental Health and Safety at the University of Missouri, speaking about DNR's red tape reduction efforts at the MECC. ""It's been a very different year to be in Missouri.""Others, though, have regarded the changes with a sense of caution.“I’m very leery of this process under the Greitens administration. I’m going to be curious to see how Parson handles this going forward,” said Steve Mahfood, a former director of the DNR. “There’s so much going on at any time, that’s it hard to make sense of it.... Is it trying to get rid of outdated regulation or reduce overall regulation? It’s hard to tell.”Of course, all the Greitens-era changes coincided with a reduction of DNR staff and resources. Shrinking through attrition and an eye for “efficiencies,” the size of the agency went from 1,403 full-time employees in early 2017 to a current headcount of 1,329 people. But technical positions have held steady and actually increased slightly, by about one percent.And while environmental policy in the Parson era has yet to take shape, many expect the farmer-turned-governor to be a reliable advocate for agricultural interests. In other areas, some wonder if he may distinguish himself from Greitens’ environmental agenda, particularly if he overrides efforts to divert funding for state parks.But even those critical of some recent changes at the DNR point out that bigger shifts in environmental policy have stemmed from the state Legislature.“2018 will likely go down as one of the most consequential sessions on environmental issues in a long time,” said the Missouri Coalition for the Environment in their legislative summary, listing a half dozen specific bills that will “that will negatively impact our shared environment for years to come.”

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri school board says state should reconsider how it measures charter schools,"Jun 14, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/education/missouri-school-board-says-state-should-reconsider-how-it-measures/article_da7798c5-3d41-5c3a-89ef-d7afbd6209d8.html,"At its first business meeting this year, the Missouri Board of Education renewed three St. Louis charter schools for five more years on Thursday, while questioning whether the state is evaluating charter schools appropriately.Charter schools are independently run public schools. In Missouri, charter schools exist only in St. Louis and Kansas City. They are designed to be innovative alternatives to the school districts in which they operate. Missouri law requires charter schools to be renewed, in most cases, every five years by the state board.Thursday’s renewals drew frustration from state board members who were dissatisfied with charter schools’ test scores. The state board’s comments in turn frustrated charter school leaders, who don’t think it’s fair to compare charter schools to entire school districts. The state board has long evaluated charter schools’ effectiveness primarily by comparing them to public districts.

St. Louis School Guide: Explore area charter schools“That may not particularly be a good measure,” said state board President Charlie Shields.The debate led state board members to conclude that Missouri needs to revisit its charter school laws, particularly in the area of evaluation.“I think there’s an opportunity to revisit the entire charter issue,” said Shields. “The politics about this have really been about expansion or nonexpansion. What we have not had, in my mind, is a significant discussion around our charter school laws.”Shields was critical of the performance of the St. Louis charter schools renewed Thursday, arguing that they do not convincingly outperform St. Louis Public Schools. He said the state Legislature allowed charter schools to operate in Missouri on the premise that charter schools would be easy to open, but poor-performing charter schools should be easy to close.Charter school leaders often argue that it’s difficult and unfair to compare charter schools to St. Louis Public Schools as a district overall because Missouri charter schools are much smaller and consist of one or a handful of campuses, while St. Louis Public schools has more than 70 schools.“We’re comparing a school against a system, so it is truly not apples” to apples,” said state board member Mike Jones.Jones suggested comparing charter schools to a district’s highest-performing school, but board member Vic Lenz argued that that would be unfair because some of St. Louis’ highest-performing district schools selectively admit students based on academic performance, while charter schools are not allowed to do so.State board member Peter Herschend also stressed that he doesn’t want to see charter schools “judged against mediocrity.”“I just want to hold the bar higher,” Herschend said.Herschend of Branson was appointed to the board this week, along with Carol Hallquist of Kansas City, by Gov. Mike Parson. The new members gave the state school board the quorum it had lacked since January because of political maneuvering by former Gov. Eric Greitens, who resigned June 1.Shields said he wants Missouri leaders, including legislators, the governor’s office, the Missouri Charter Public School Association and others to discuss revising Missouri’s charter school laws.
It is up to a charter school’s sponsor, not the state board, to ensure that schools are meeting the state’s and their own performance expectations. Every charter school has a sponsor, usually a university, that monitors the school’s performance through a contract with the school.The state board is required by law to renew a charter school as long as that school meets statutory requirements, even if the board is unhappy with the school’s performance.Lift for Life Academy, which opened in 2000, met only half of the academic achievement goals outlined in its contract with Southeast Missouri State University, which sponsors the school. The school has met its annual performance report goal just once in the past four years, but it met its goals for science and social studies achievement, attendance and graduation rate.Lift for Life leaders attribute performance shortfalls largely to the fact that students enroll at the middle school and high school as sixth-graders with pre-existing achievement gaps. They hope to close those gaps by eventually offering elementary grades.“The ability to support those children earlier will also help support our middle school and the challenges you see,” said Diana Rogers-Adkinson, dean of Southeast Missouri State’s college of education, at Thursday’s state board meeting.
Lafayette Preparatory Academy, meanwhile, met four of six of its contract performance goals in English but did not meet its math and science goals. Percentage-wise, its students outperformed St. Louis Public Schools students in comparable grades on English and math tests in 2017. Lafayette is sponsored by the University of Missouri-St. Louis.Eagle College Prep, which is sponsored by University of Missouri-Columbia, met all its contract goals and outperformed St. Louis students in comparable grades in English and math in the past three years. But it performed worse than St. Louis students in science all three years.Commissioner searchOne of the last actions the state school board took in December, before losing its quorum in January, was to fire Missouri’s education commissioner, Margie Vandeven. The move was an objective of the former governor.On Thursday, the board said it’s in no rush to set a timeline for the search for a new commissioner because it’s happy with the leadership of interim Commissioner Roger Dorson“I think we need to be very deliberate about this. We need to take our time,” Shields said. Shields asked board members to think about what they want to see in a commissioner, for discussion at the next board meeting.Other pending business includes:• A planned revamp of Missouri’s school accountability system, known as the Missouri School Improvement Program. The board can expect a final draft of changes in September, said Assistant Commissioner for Quality Schools Chris Neale.• A decision on St. Louis Public Schools’ governance, Shields suggested that making the final decision to return the district to an elected school board should wait until certain criteria are met, such as training.St. Louis School Guide: Get test scores and more"
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"In another break from Greitens, Parson says he won't shy away from using state plane","Jun 14, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/in-another-break-from-greitens-parson-says-he-won-t/article_b8332c17-3915-593e-b2e7-44579368de7f.html,"Updated at 6 p.m., after governor’s stop in St. Louis.COLUMBIA, Mo. • Gov. Mike Parson has already signaled a less combative tone than his predecessor, and on Wednesday, he announced another break from ex-Gov. Eric Greitens: that he will use a taxpayer-funded state plane instead of shunning it.“We’ll be using the state plane when we feel like it’s appropriate to use it,” Parson said during a question-and-answer session with reporters at the University of Missouri-Columbia. “We’ll be driving when we can. I think right now there’s nothing more important than traveling the state and trying to find out what are the issues facing all of the communities, all of the people of Missouri.”

On Wednesday, Parson was on the second day of a two-day tour around the state, stopping in Columbia in the morning. He also planned stops at an agricultural research center in Gordonville, Three Rivers College in Sikeston, and the Cortex research hub in St. Louis.It was initially unclear Wednesday how much a state plane was being used for this tour. Parson took over for the embattled Greitens on June 1 after Greitens left office.Greitens, who like Parson is a Republican, largely shunned the state plane during his 17 months as chief executive, instead opting to travel privately. He even directed the state to sell four of its planes.Greitens argued that the move was to save taxpayer money, but questions circulated throughout his tenure about who exactly was paying for his travel. In personal financial disclosure forms filed in May, Greitens wrote that GOP donor Stanley Herzog’s company provided almost $90,000 worth of personal travel and lodging to Greitens last year.Parson said one reason he was willing to use the state plane more often than Greitens was to boost transparency. “We want you to know where I’m going,” Parson said.Parson, after touring Mizzou’s immersive visualization lab on Wednesday, told reporters that two of his priorities as governor would be improving infrastructure and focusing on workforce development.He again signaled his support for a gradual 10-cent increase in the state’s gasoline tax — which is to go before voters this November — and praised legislators for reversing Greitens’ planned $68 million cut to higher education this year.On education, Parson said, “We’re well aware of what we’re going to have to do for the future, because one thing is for sure: We can’t go out here and say we’re going to cut the education arena and all of sudden say we want skilled workers out there.”
It is unclear if Parson’s signaled support for higher education would translate into more dollars for public higher education in the future.Mun Choi, president of the University of Missouri System, said that though the state reversed planned cuts to public universities this year, nationwide, state support for public higher education was trending down.Last week, the Columbia campus announced it was shedding 185 positions — the majority of which were already vacant — and shaving $45 million in costs in preparation for the upcoming fiscal year.
Choi said that in lieu of increased state support, the university system would have to consider ways to increase revenue itself, including through research breakthroughs and expansion of digital learning programs.“We have to be in control of our own destiny,” Choi said. “We have to prepare for a future with less state support — which means, we have to be more entrepreneurial.”Later, Parson met privately with executives of the Cortex innovation and technology hub near the Central West End.Speaking briefly afterward with reporters, he didn’t give any details about what was said in the meeting, but stressed in general terms the need to improve infrastructure in Missouri.“We can’t keep kicking the can down the road,” he said.Kevin McDermott of the Post-Dispatch contributed to this report.@JackSuntrup on Twitterjsuntrup@post-dispatch.com

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Editorial: Gov. Parson's education board appointments reflect a welcome new approach,"Jun 13, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-gov-parson-s-education-board-appointments-reflect-a-welcome/article_166aa8ac-a75a-5ffe-a96b-799c74e5726c.html,"Missouri’s education leaders can get back to business with enthusiasm and optimism this week now that Gov. Mike Parson has made two new appointments to the state Board of Education. The board, which oversees about 900,000 students in K-12 education, has had too few members since December to appoint a new state schools commissioner.A hefty agenda awaits members, including whether to let an elected school board take control of St. Louis Public Schools. Parson would be wise to give the board a wide berth to conduct its business without executive meddling.The board’s problems were created when Gov. Eric Greitens stacked it last year in a drawn-out effort to oust the widely respected education commissioner, Margie Vandeven. He succeeded in ousting her, but the Missouri Senate retaliated by not confirming Greitens’ board appointees.

Parson delivered on the promise he made when he assumed office June 1 that one of his first orders of business would be to fill five vacancies on the eight-member board. Three vacancies remain, but with Tuesday’s appointments, the board has enough members to convene for a required semiannual meeting.Parson understands the urgency parents and families of schoolchildren feel after Greitens steamrolled the public education system to advance his political agenda. The former governor never clearly indicated why he wanted to replace Vandeven, but his efforts appeared aimed at installing someone determined to expand school choice through charter schools and increased use of vouchers. The formerly constituted school board had never turned down a charter school application, and critics contended the move was simply a power grab by Greitens.
Parson is taking a far more collegial approach, reflected by his appointees. One is Peter Herschend, a former president of the education board and one of the members Greitens’ booted off last year. Herschend, a Republican, is co-owner of the company that owns Silver Dollar City. The other is Democrat Carol Hallquist of Kansas City, a former Hallmark Cards executive and founder of PrincipalsConnect, a nonprofit that provides volunteers to urban schools.
With the state Senate out of session, the two new members do not need confirmation and can begin serving immediately.The unprecedented fiasco caused by Greitens’ meddling paralyzed the board, forcing cancellation of five of its last 11 meetings and leaving several important issues hanging. Parson’s new board has no time to waste on key education decisions, including what kind of board should govern St. Louis Public Schools and its roughly 24,000 students. Other top priorities are deciding how to remake the state’s public school evaluation system and whether five low-performing charter schools should lose their ability to operate at the end of the month.Parson is mending fences, ending acrimony and getting on with the job of governing Missouri. His quick action on the school board is a welcome change of course."
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Low-income housing tax credit program deserves a critical evaluation,"Jun 13, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/columnists/low-income-housing-tax-credit-program-deserves-a-critical-evaluation/article_e3d46126-a555-518d-ab1e-b1790c05f2fc.html,"For more than 30 years, the low-income housing tax credit program has enjoyed bipartisan support despite being poorly designed and having a poor track record at improving housing for low-income families. In fact, Congress recently expanded the program.But we hope the controversy over the program playing out in Missouri will lead to a critical evaluation of the tax credit program for the entire nation.Disgraced former Gov. Eric Greitens moved to end state funding for Missouri’s participation in the program, which would eliminate federal matching funds. Many assume that Gov. Mike Parson, who was sworn in Friday, will now work to reinstate the program’s funding. However, the state’s House budget chairman has indicated that he will attempt to thwart such moves.

Nationally, the low-income housing tax credit program provides $9 billion a year in tax subsidies for rental housing construction plus $100 million in administrative costs. In exchange for the subsidy, developers cap rents for tenants who meet income criteria.The program has several shortcomings. First, it yields little additional housing per dollar spent. Second, the program doesn’t adequately target the poor. New tenants can have incomes up to 60 percent of area median income. For the city of St. Louis, for example, that income limit amounts to $46,080 annually for a family of four. Once in the program, participants can continue to receive subsidies with incomes as high as 140 percent of the area median.Third, the tax credit program is excessively bureaucratic, which has made it susceptible to corruption. The federal government distributes the funds to state housing authorities, who then issue grants to private developers. Developers usually sell their credits to banks, allowing them to offset taxes and fulfill Community Reinvestment Act requirements. The application process has spawned an industry of accounting and law firms specializing in securing grants.Meeting the eligibility criteria does not guarantee one a unit. In fact, most low-income people do not benefit from the tax credit. Residents, while not well off, are not necessarily poor. Those not receiving units often pay higher rents for inferior units elsewhere, sometimes waiting years for a subsidized unit to become available.Construction based on the tax credits does not simply add to the housing stock. It also crowds out housing from private markets. Researchers report that each dollar of low-income housing tax credit subsidy yields only between 50 and 80 cents of additional housing.
A 2009 study by economist Michael Eriksen found that the program’s construction costs were 20 percent higher than for similar unsubsidized projects, partly due to rules and regulations intended to improve developments. Another factor may be that the program generally funds new constructions, even though renovating existing housing is more cost effective.The low-income housing tax credit program is not merely inefficient, it also fosters corruption. The program was central to the 2010 conviction of 14 Dallas politicians and real estate developers on charges that included bribery and extortion. The Dallas Morning News referred to the scandal as “the largest public corruption investigation in Dallas history.” Similar cases of fraud, amounting to tens of millions of dollars, have occurred in Florida and California.
Policymakers should consider more effective approaches for increasing the supply of affordable housing. For example, providing housing vouchers directly to individuals, with few restrictions, would be a better approach. However, the most obvious alternative is to make building less costly by eliminating some land use regulations. Unfortunately, over the past 50 years, many cities have moved in the opposite direction, producing unaffordable housing by severely restricting building.There is ample evidence that easing building regulations would be a more effective way to promote affordable housing than programs such as the low-income housing tax credit program. This is especially true in cities in the northeast and coastal California, where regulations have made cities unaffordable even for middle- and upper-middle income households.We agree with Harvard economist Edward Glaeser, who writes that “growth, not height restrictions and a fixed building stock, keeps space affordable and ensures that poorer people and less profitable firms can stay.”After more than 30 years of the low-income housing tax credit program, it is past time to explore alternative paths for addressing the very real problem of unaffordable housing.Seth H. Giertz is an associate professor of economics and a senior research fellow with the Colloquium for the Advancement of Free-Enterprise Education, both at the University of Texas at Dallas.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Editorial:  Parson, the anti-Greitens, hits all the right notes","Jun 12, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-parson-the-anti-greitens-hits-all-the-right-notes/article_31701a7c-70ef-5631-8eb7-7019a55809a3.html,"It wasn’t exactly, “My fellow Americans, our long national nightmare is over,” but Gov. Mike Parson struck the right tone Monday in his first address to the Legislature since taking over from Gov. Eric Greitens on June 1. Parson’s call for a “fresh start” and an elevated “tone of our political discourse” recalled President Gerald Ford’s reassuring remarks upon being sworn in to replace Richard Nixon.Parson’s remarks were balm to a state battered by sleazy controversies since news of Greitens’ extramarital affair broke on Jan. 10. There followed seven months of scandal, legal proceedings and pre-impeachment hearings that embarrassed Missouri.But even before Jan. 10, Greitens had a difficult relationship with many of his fellow lawmakers. He had campaigned against “career politicians,” sparing neither Democrats nor his fellow Republicans. On his Facebook page, he had called them “liars, cowards, sociopaths” and people “drawn to politics as vultures flock to rotting meat — and they feed off the carcasses of vice.”

After that, almost anything Parson could have said would have been soothing. But he took special care to praise legislators as “honorable men and women” and “citizen patriots” who weren’t looking to build careers but “were called to be a public servant.”In a gesture of humility rarely witnessed under Greitens, Parson even entered the House chamber through a side door instead of staging a triumphal march up the middle aisle. He was a familiar face, having served in the Legislature for a dozen years before being elected lieutenant governor in 2016. Indeed, he is a recognizable type, a middle-aged rural conservative similar to dozens who sit in the Legislature. He is unlikely to rappel into a bull-riding arena, as Greitens did.“The atmosphere of the Capitol has lightened considerably,” Sen. Rob Schaaf, R-St. Joseph, who had been singled out by Greitens’ political hit-squad for special harassment, told the Springfield News-Leader. “You just walk into the building and you don’t feel that oppression every minute of being here.”
Parson took a few not-so-subtle jabs at Greitens. He reminded his fellow lawmakers that “we serve the people and the state of Missouri — not the other way around.“Sadly, much of the political turmoil that has engulfed our state is a result of these truths being forgotten. When the public’s trust is violated, we are obligated to act.”
He praised the “care, prudence, and professionalism” of lawmakers who dug into the allegations against Greitens.It would have been nice to hear him take such a stand while Greitens was still in office, though admittedly as lieutenant governor he couldn’t appear to be too eager to take over.Parson’s legislative voting record favored conservative positions that we believe have not well served the majority of Missouri citizens. We expect to disagree with him on the issues. But on character and the sincerity of his beliefs, we stand with him."

Parson attempts to end acrimony, fills Board of Education vacancies","Jun 12, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/education/new-gov-parson-attempts-to-end-acrimony-fills-board-of/article_e2de08e6-2f8f-5a1b-96b2-d21ca3a43e9f.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Gov. Mike Parson named two members to the state’s Board of Education on Tuesday, a move that will allow the panel to establish a quorum and meet for the first time in five months.Parson, a Republican, named Carol Hallquist and Peter Herschend to the panel, which oversees K-12 education in Missouri.Parson’s predecessor, Eric Greitens, picked Herschend, of Branson, for the board last July but pulled his appointment later that year as he was trying to cobble together enough votes to boot former Education Commissioner Margie Vandeven.

While Greitens was ultimately successful in ousting Vandeven last December, the move triggered immediate fallout, with the Senate refusing to confirm Greitens’ appointees when it reconvened in January.Parson’s move seemingly ended the five-month standoff. The two new members will be able to serve immediately because the Senate is not in session to confirm them. The next education board meeting is set for Thursday.Hallquist, of Kansas City, is the former president of the Hallmark Corporate Foundation at Hallmark Cards Inc. She also founded the nonprofit Principals-Connect, according to a news release.Herschend, according to the release, co-founded and co-owned Herschend Family Entertainment Corp., which owns the Silver Dollar City amusement park. He retired in 2006 and previously served three terms on the Board of Education, including stints as president of the panel.Herschend is a Republican; Hallquist is a Democrat. State statute requires the board to maintain a bipartisan makeup. Parson’s decision means there are now five members on the eight-member panel — enough to form a quorum.“We owe it to our students to provide the best, high quality public education in Missouri,” Parson said in a written statement. “It was important to act quickly to restore and provide functionality to the State Board of Education.”Greitens, also a Republican, spent several months last year filling board vacancies — and then removing his appointees when they signaled they would not do his bidding.
Greitens’ aim was to orchestrate the firing of Vandeven. After finally succeeding, Greitens met swift backlash for the maneuver from lawmakers who had yet to vote to confirm any of the then governor’s appointees. Because the Legislature was not in session in December, the appointees were able to cast the controversial votes without having received confirmation from the Senate.Greitens withdrew his nominations as the Legislature was convening its regular session in January, and shortly thereafter reappointed them, giving the Senate all spring to consider the nominees.But senators refused to confirm Greitens’ appointees, leaving the board powerless and unable to meet.Parson said the board would continue with a “diligent national search, to find a capable, qualified candidate to serve as Missouri’s commissioner of education.”
Parson met with Charlie Shields, the Board of Education president, last week to discuss the picks.“Governor Parson’s decision to appoint Carol and Peter will help restore and maintain stability,” Shields said in a statement. “As a board, we are ready to work together to give Missouri students what they deserve — the best public education.”Sen. Gary Romine, a Farmington Republican who chairs the Senate Education Committee, said he and others had screened potential nominees for “the last several months” in an effort to jolt the board back into action. Because of that, Romine said, Parson was able to act quickly to make his appointments.“A lot of good things will come out of this,” Romine said.Melissa Randol, the executive director of the Missouri School Boards’ Association, also praised Parson’s move.“We thank Governor Parson for placing such a high priority on appointments to the State Board of Education,” she said in a written statement. “The extraordinary experience of the two appointees will enable the State Board to resume its responsibilities quickly.”"
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Greitens broke law by hiring taxpayer-paid impeachment attorneys, House committee chairman says","Jun 12, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/greitens-broke-law-by-hiring-taxpayer-paid-impeachment-attorneys-house/article_6017c8be-381e-509c-9e4a-1799937ced3e.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • The former chairman of a Missouri House committee that was investigating ex-Gov. Eric Greitens said Monday the governor broke the law when his office hired two taxpayer-paid impeachment attorneys.Rep. Jay Barnes, R-Jefferson City, made the charge in a three-page letter delivered Monday to Sarah Steelman, commissioner of the state's Office of Administration. He also argues that Greitens should be on the hook for about $153,000 attorneys Ross Garber and Ed Greim charged the state through the end of May.

""Instead of placing the burden on Missouri taxpayers, those legal fees should be borne exclusively by Eric Greitens himself,"" Barnes wrote.Barnes argues that agreements the state signed with Garber and Greim are not valid because state law forbids officials from making contracting decisions that result in a personal benefit to the official.Barnes also said Greitens violated his own executive order which states that administration employees cannot ""participate in a proceeding or decision in which the state employee's impartiality might be reasonably questioned due to the state employee's personal or financial relationship with a participant in the proceeding.""""In addition to violating the criminal conflict of interest provisions"" of state law, Barnes wrote, ""the Garber-Greim purported contracts also violate Greitens' first official act as governor.""Barnes argues that Steelman should not approve the $153,000 Garber and Greim billed the state. A spokeswoman for the Office of Administration said Monday that the bills were still under review.Garber, a Washington, D.C.-based attorney who has represented troubled governors in Alabama, Connecticut and South Carolina, said Tuesday it was ""common practice"" for administrations to seek outside legal help.""This is a sound practice because it recognizes the significant public interests at stake in these matters,"" Garber said.
He said he represented the interests of the governor's office, not Greitens himself. Without him, ""advocacy would be left to lawyers representing solely the interests of the current occupant of the office.""Greim, who works for the GOP-connected, Kansas City-based Graves Garrett law firm, said the ""underlying mistake"" in Barnes' analysis is that he assumes ""the office of the governor is simply an empty chair that different occupants fill from time to time.""
He said that over time, ""precedents develop that change the powers, rights and duties of that office. If the constitutional balance is not kept true, then it will be too easy — and if you look at it the other way, too hard — to remove officeholders.""Greim also said that it was his and Garber's job to advocate preferred versions of impeachment procedures and standards for impeachment, not the facts of the case.""Personal counsel argued the facts,"" Greim said. ""That was not our job.""He also said the Office of Administration is ""under a clear legal duty to pay us"" and said he believed they ultimately would.Auditor Nicole Galloway, a Democrat, and Attorney General Josh Hawley, a Republican, both raised concerns last month about the hiring of the Garber and Greim.Hawley wrote in a letter to Galloway that while state agencies can hire outside legal counsel, they must first seek permission through the attorney general's office — something the Greitens administration had not done, Hawley said.It was unclear Tuesday what Gov. Mike Parson, who oversees the Office of Administration, would do regarding the legal bills. His spokeswoman, Kelli Jones, said Parson had yet to take a stance.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri's new governor offers 'fresh start' in first address to state lawmakers,"Jun 11, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-s-new-governor-offers-fresh-start-in-first-address/article_f2334a7b-3b28-548f-aab2-153fa6663fdc.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Missouri’s new Gov. Mike Parson made his debut to state lawmakers on Monday, delivering a brief address light on policy prescriptions. He used the opportunity, however, to set a tone of collegiality in a Capitol consumed by controversy for five months.“In this chamber, we have the opportunity for a fresh start — to elevate the tone of our political discourse, to recommit ourselves to the values that made our system of government the envy of the world,” Parson told lawmakers and other dignitaries. “This does not mean disregarding our beliefs or moderating our positions. It means debating with respect.”Parson, 62, a Republican, entered his second full week on the job amid a cascade of activity after taking over for ex-Gov. Eric Greitens, also a Republican, on June 1. Lawmakers greeted Parson on Monday with cheers and a standing ovation as he approached the House dais.

They also voted to end the special session that lawmakers launched in May to continue their investigation of Greitens. It was still unclear Monday to what extent the House would investigate the former governor’s “dark money,” or the mysterious payments to Greitens’ opponents.“We must be careful not to erode the public’s trust in our system of government for short-term personal gain,” Parson said. “We should expect criticism and understand that some of it is unfair — but we must always take (responsibility) for our own actions. Most of all, we must always remember that we serve the people and the state of Missouri, not the other way around.“Sadly, much of the political turmoil that has engulfed our state is a result of these truths’ being forgotten,” Parson said, referring to Greitens. Many argued that Greitens put personal interests ahead of the state’s when he refused to resign as scandals around him grew.














        
            Who is Mike Parson? Meet Missouri's lieutenant governor, who steps up to replace Greitens

Mike Parson, 62, a veteran and former rural county sheriff began his career at the Capitol in 2005. 




State agency leaders, the public, the media and others crammed into the House chamber to hear Parson’s address, which lasted about 15 minutes. The speech capped a busy day for Parson’s fledgling administration, and the tone he has so far set drew praise from Republicans and Democrats.Missouri’s congressional delegation filled Parson’s office Monday morning with the kind of hand-shaking, back-slapping bipartisanship that was largely absent during the 17-month tenure of his predecessor.Parson summoned the 10-member congressional delegation to the Capitol for a meeting Monday morning. After the meeting, U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill, one of only three Democrats in the delegation, said that Monday was “not a day to talk about disagreements” she had with Parson, and noted the change in tenor between him and Greitens.“I don’t think that Gov. Greitens saw this as a team effort,” McCaskill said after the meeting. “I think he saw it as that he could always go it alone and that he was wanting to fight everybody. This governor appears that he wants to work with everybody instead of fight everybody.”Eight members of the delegation — everyone except U.S. Reps. William Lacy Clay of St. Louis and Sam Graves of Tarkio — showed up for the rare gathering.When asked if he’d had much contact with Greitens, U.S. Rep. Blaine Luetkemeyer, R-St. Elizabeth, said “no.”
“I’m very hopeful” the relationship with the governor’s office will improve, Luetkemeyer said. “We are already one meeting ahead of both of the previous two governors.”Rep. Vicky Hartzler, R-Harrisonville, said she had Parson’s personal cellphone number when asked how her relationship with Parson would differ from her relationship with Greitens.“I’ve known him for several years,” she said. “I can text him and he will text back quickly. I can call him on his personal cellphone and he calls me back.”
Hartzler said she advocated expanding rural broadband and addressing opioid addiction to the new governor. McCaskill said the group also talked about workforce development and infrastructure.McCaskill also said she was concerned about tariffs being slapped onto Missouri agricultural products amid escalating trade tension between President Donald Trump’s administration and foreign countries.“I certainly expressed concerns for the ag community,” she said, “on this looming trade war and what a devastating impact that could have on Missouri’s economy.”“I’m concerned about the tariffs, especially for our agricultural community here,” U.S. Rep. Ann Wagner, R-Ballwin, said before the meeting.Parson is embarking on a statewide “listening tour” Tuesday and Wednesday, and he is expected to appoint this week members to the state’s Board of Education, which has been unable to meet since January.Rep. Peter Merideth, D-St. Louis, said Parson’s “honeymoon” period would last as long as the state did not “return to politics as usual.”“If he’s willing to work with us on things like health care and infrastructure and education, then I think there’s a possibility this lasts,” Merideth said. “It’s easy to talk about bipartisanship and being willing to work together. But we’re going to have to see it in action.”Merideth also said reforming how the state treated untraceable political donations, or dark money, would be a top election issue in 2018.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Editorial: Getting a fuel tax increase on the ballot was the easy part,"Jun 10, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-getting-a-fuel-tax-increase-on-the-ballot-was/article_f3a27afc-612d-5385-abab-c6c48676e385.html,"Last month the Missouri Legislature, after years of nervous dithering, finally decided to ask voters whether they wanted to raise the state’s motor fuel tax for the first time since 1992. If voters approve the ballot measure in November, the 17-cents-a gallon tax would rise to 27 cents in four increments by 2022.That the Republican-dominated Legislature would put a potential 63 percent tax increase on the ballot in an election year is a mark of just how bad the roads have become. But putting it on the ballot was the easy part; lawmakers must now get out in front and sell a tax increase. This will be heresy for some of them. Gov. Mike Parson must lead the way.Parson was asked about the fuel tax proposal last week in one of his first meetings with reporters since assuming office June 1. He said he was for it. Sort of.

“I’m going to be supporting infrastructure in the state of Missouri and, yes, if that’s [the tax hike] part of the infrastructure plan,” he said. “I think that is important. We need to make sure we’ve got a good plan in place.”The Missouri Department of Transportation has a long list of plans and projects and can provide Parson all the plans he’d ever want. The agency says it needs $825 million more each year to adequately maintain the state’s vast system of 33,856 miles of highway and 10,403 bridges. When fully implemented in 2022, the 10-cent increase would yield about half of that. Some of it would fund the Highway Patrol, and a fourth would go to cities and counties for road work.
In outstate Missouri, there’s still some residual resentment over what happened the last time the fuel tax was increased. In 1992, the tax went up 6 cents on the promise that the state’s “total transportation plan” would link every city with a population of 5,000 or more with four-lane highways. The grand scheme would have required a massive bond issue that never materialized.
Any tax increase is a tough sell. Because of 20 years of corporate tax cuts, families and individuals are stuck with an unfair share of the total tax load. For every $1.28 in income, sales and miscellaneous taxes paid by families and individuals, Missouri corporations pay about a nickel.The trucking industry isn’t thrilled with it, either. The industry paid 39 percent of all taxes and fees owed by Missouri motorists, though accounting for only 15 percent of vehicle miles traveled. However, by some estimates big trucks cause 90 percent of the damage to roads and bridges.Fuel taxes are user fees, by far the fairest way to pay for highways. That shouldn’t be a hard sell, but the governor and other state leaders are going to have to make it."
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Editorial: Voters should select a new lieutenant governor,"Jun 9, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-voters-should-select-a-new-lieutenant-governor/article_a9966a03-caa7-5497-a262-b62f2898877b.html,"As inconsequential as the Missouri lieutenant governor’s job usually is, it should be filled. As John Adams, America’s vice president put it, “I am vice president. In this I am nothing, but I may be everything.”Gov. Mike Parson knows this first-hand, having ascended to the office June 1 upon the resignation of Gov. Eric Greitens. Parson and the Legislature should address the vacancy as quickly as possible.Right now legal experts disagree on what, if anything, can be done. Former Missouri Supreme Court Chief Justice Michael Wolff and former Missouri House Chief Clerk and Administrator Stephen S. Davis recently have argued on our commentary page that state law prevents governors from appointing lieutenant governors.

Joe Bednar, who was chief counsel to Gov. Mel Carnahan when Carnahan was killed in an October 2000 plane crash, immediately advised Gov. Roger Wilson, who had been lieutenant governor, that he must appoint a successor. Wilson waited three weeks until Election Day and appointed Joe Maxwell, the winner of the lieutenant governor’s race, to take over immediately.Bednar said the state constitution says “there shall be a lieutenant governor” and the “governor shall fill all vacancies … unless otherwise provided by law.” The law doesn’t otherwise provide.
Davis suggests Parson should provide new instructions to the current special session of the Legislature to deal with the vacancy. The text of Senate Bill 1038, which Sen. Bob Dixon, R-Springfield, introduced after the Greitens scandal erupted last January, could serve as a starting point.
The bill never got out of committee, but it calls for the governor to set an election to fill a lieutenant governor’s vacancy at the next general election, assuming the election date is at least 120 days away. Otherwise the office remains vacant. The Nov. 6 election is 149 days off.Parson could take Bednar’s advice and appoint someone on his own. No doubt he’d appoint a fellow Republican, and there are lots of qualified candidates. Among them are former Lt. Gov. Peter Kinder, who offers 12 years’ experience, and popular leaders like House Speaker Todd Richardson of Poplar Bluff and Senate President Pro Tem Ron Richard of Joplin, both of whom are leaving the Legislature because of term limits.The salary is only $86,600, less than someone could make as a lobbyist, but unless Parson found a caretaker candidate, the new lieutenant governor would immediately become a potential rival for the likes of state Treasurer Eric Schmitt and Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft, who might also want to move up.With the law unclear, a unilateral appointment might be challenged in court. It would cut voters out of the decision-making process. They lost a governor just 17 months into his term. They shouldn’t be denied a chance to elect a new No. 2."
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"One week into office, new Missouri governor adds prosecutor to his staff","Jun 8, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/one-week-into-office-new-missouri-governor-adds-prosecutor-to/article_54fa81f7-24b1-5763-8f7b-a245cb940d92.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Gov. Mike Parson added the Cape Girardeau County prosecutor to his staff Friday, marking the latest hire the new governor has made since taking office a week earlier.Christopher Limbaugh, who has served as the prosecuting attorney in the southeast Missouri county since 2012, will replace general counsel Lucinda Luetkemeyer, who resigned on the same day as her boss, former Gov. Eric Greitens.“Limbaugh brings proven legal experience to our office,” Parson said in a statement. “Not only does he have a wealth of courtroom experience, but his legal work on governmental affairs for the Cape Girardeau County Commission and his state legislature work with the Missouri Association of Prosecuting Attorneys is the kind of experience that will benefit our office.""

Since taking office, Parson has been filling top spots in his administration. Many of Greitens' closest aides resigned their positions after he announced he was stepping down amid an ongoing scandal.Limbaugh was appointed to the county post by then-Governor, Jay Nixon, to an unexpired term of office.  In 2014, he was elected to serve a four-year term without opposition. The governor's office said Limbaugh has overseen more than 2,000 felony and misdemeanor cases per year, and he has personally tried more than 20 jury trials, including capital murder, first and second degree murder, possession and distribution of controlled substances, and other offenses
Limbaugh holds a law degree from the University of Missouri-Columbia School of Law. He is also the son of Stephen N. Limbaugh, Jr., who currently serves as a United States District Judge and former Judge of the Supreme Court of Missouri, and he is grandson of Stephen Limbaugh, Sr., a retired United States District Judge, who is now in private practice.He is a cousin of conservative radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh.
“Chris Limbaugh has done an exceptional job in leading the Cape Girardeau County prosecutor’s office. His knowledge of the law and ability to keep Missourians safe leaves him exceptionally qualified to take this next step to help Governor Parson,” said U.S. Rep. Jason Smith, R-Salem. “Chris Limbaugh has a reputation as a fine lawyer and public servant of the law,” said House Speaker Todd Richardson, R-Poplar Bluff. A salary for Limbaugh was not immediately available. Luetkemeyer earned about $124,000 annually.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,New Missouri governor to announce school board picks next week,"Jun 7, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/education/new-missouri-governor-to-announce-school-board-picks-next-week/article_3b585e20-9b53-5616-9f3b-4223af30f0af.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Missouri Gov. Mike Parson is expected to appoint at least two new members to the state school board next week in a bid to close a controversial chapter of the state’s education bureaucracy.Parson, who took over for former Gov. Eric Greitens last week, has said getting the board up and running after five months in limbo is a priority. And under state statute, the board is required to meet in June.“We are very well aware of the state school board,” Parson said after he was sworn in last week. “We aim to get that board up and running as soon as we can.”

Word of the pending appointments came after a meeting Thursday between Parson and state school board President Charlie Shields. Shields, a former state senator, said he expects an announcement Tuesday or Wednesday.“I think they’ve got a couple of people in mind,” Shields told the Post-Dispatch.The board has had to cancel five of its 11 meetings scheduled for this year because it lacks enough members to meet and take action. It has just three of eight members because the Senate refused to confirm five Greitens appointees after he stacked the board in order to oust former schools commissioner Margie Vandeven last year.Parson would need to appoint at least two people for the board to have a quorum and hold its next meeting, which is set for Thursday.“We’ve been working constantly behind the scenes here just to make sure we are ready with everything that needs to go before the board the minute that they can meet,” said DESE spokesman Tyler Madsen.As a backup, the board also has scheduled June 26 for a meeting if Parson doesn’t act next week.“We’ve had these dates circled for quite a while because we knew that by state statute we’ve got to have a meeting in June,” Madsen said.
Current board members are Shields of St. Joseph, Mike Jones of St. Louis and Vic Lenz of St. Louis County.Among items facing the board is the hiring of a replacement for Vandeven, who had been in the post since 2015.Shields said making the hire is a priority, but there is no need to rush the process because the interim commissioner, Roger Dorson, is well qualified to handle the duties.The board also must decide whether to renew six charter schools, including Lafayette Preparatory Academy, Lift for Life Academy and Eagle College Prep, all in St. Louis.
And, it must weigh in on whether an elected school board should regain control of St. Louis Public Schools from the appointed Special Administrative Board.“There are a lot of things that are not complicated but they have been backed up,” Shields said.An announcement on the appointees is not expected to come when Parson addresses a joint session of the House and Senate at 5 p.m. Monday.The Legislature is currently in a special session that was called to consider the impeachment of Greitens over the circumstances of an extramarital affair and his use of a charity donor list to raise money for his campaign.With the former governor now gone after his abrupt resignation, the two chambers will hear from Parson and then adjourn.If Parson were to make the picks before the Senate adjourns from its special session, the appointees would need to be confirmed by the Legislature’s upper chamber. If he waits until the session is over, the new members can be sworn in as interim appointees and begin serving immediately."
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Lawmakers drop subpoena seeking Greitens dark money donors, for now","Jun 7, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/lawmakers-drop-subpoena-seeking-greitens-dark-money-donors-for-now/article_cb04ae7e-6134-592c-be61-fbd708dc956a.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • A panel of lawmakers investigating former Gov. Eric Greitens has dropped its attempt to secure records showing who secretly contributed money to the ousted chief executive.An attorney for the special House committee that had been deliberating on whether to recommend Greitens be impeached withdrew a request Wednesday seeking records from the ex-governor’s campaign committee and a dark money nonprofit called A New Missouri.The withdrawal notes that the panel may again seek the records. At issue is the wording of the committee’s purpose, which is to investigate issues related to Greitens.

“The Special Committee on Oversight believes the requested records are relevant to its charge and should be produced for the committee and all Missourians to see. However, the committee has determined to withdraw its pending request as it reviews its options,” attorney Mark Kempton wrote in a document obtained by the Post-Dispatch.Now that Greitens isn’t governor, it is unclear whether the committee has the power to subpoena those particular documents.The decision came a day before a hearing was scheduled to argue whether the records should be released.On Friday, the same day Greitens formally resigned from office under the cloud of an ongoing scandal, Cole County Circuit Judge Jon Beetem granted a reprieve from an order requiring the two organizations to turn over a list of donors.As part of the investigation, the nonprofit and the campaign committee had been facing a Friday deadline to disclose the evidence, but Beetem allowed for a delay because of the extraordinary circumstances of Greitens’ abrupt departure.
Attorney Catherine Hanaway, a former House speaker who is representing the two campaign organizations on behalf of Greitens, argued that the House panel created to investigate the governor no longer has the authority to demand the documents because of Greitens’ resignation.In a statement Wednesday, Hanaway said, “Our motion to reconsider was so persuasive the House dismissed its case.”
A New Missouri is overseen by Greitens’ former campaign manager and has been active in supporting his causes and rallying against opponents who disagreed with him during his 17-month tenure.Because of its nonprofit status, the group doesn’t have to publicly reveal its financial and other information the way a regular PAC would. That has led to criticism that Greitens, a Republican, and his allies were using the nonprofit to hide their political donations and activities from public view.The future of the committee could be decided as early as Monday when lawmakers convene to hear a joint address by new Gov. Mike Parson, who stepped into the post when Greitens left.House Speaker Todd Richardson, R-Poplar Bluff, could remake the panel and charge them with continuing to probe Greitens.Or, the committee could compile the evidence it already has collected into a final report.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Having Missouri Highway Patrol return to St. Louis interstates under consideration by governor,"Jun 6, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/having-missouri-highway-patrol-return-to-st-louis-interstates-under/article_da85536b-9323-51bd-8a49-c2f386719a4d.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Gov. Mike Parson said he wants to help the St. Louis region combat crime, but he’s not yet sold on whether to restart one crime-fighting initiative launched by his predecessor.On his third full working day as Missouri’s new governor Wednesday, the Republican from Bolivar said he is unsure whether he’ll back a plan that saw the Missouri Highway Patrol boost its presence on interstates running through the city.Last year, at the direction of former Gov. Eric Greitens, troopers began working along portions of Interstates 55 and 70 in July with a goal of freeing up city police officers to patrol troubled neighborhoods.

The program was pared back in late October.Although troopers issued thousands of tickets and arrested hundreds, there was no concrete way to determine the effect of the program. Homicides were up overall over 2016, but were down by about 9 percent during the pilot program period compared with the same period a year earlier. Assaults involving guns were up by about the same amount when comparing July through September 2017 to the same months in 2016.“I need an opportunity to meet with the colonel of the Highway Patrol and meet with the mayors to figure out how we best do that,” said Parson, a former Polk County sheriff. “I’m sure there are other models out there. We’ve just got to figure out a solution to how we’re going to fight crime in Missouri.”His comments came before a meeting with St. Louis Mayor Lyda Krewson and St. Louis County Executive Steve Stenger — one of a series of sit-downs Parson has been doing since taking over for his scandal-plagued predecessor.Parson said he wants to work with the duo to address crime issues.“I’m going to talk about the crime issue across the state and how important that is for all Missourians. It’s not in isolated areas. It’s all of our problem,” Parson said. “My plan is to be able to give them the tools they need to get the job done.”Afterward, Krewson and Stenger said it was significant that they had a 40-minute meeting with Parson so early in his tenure.“We talked about MetroLink safety. We talked about safety in our schools. I think this meeting is the first of many. We identified key issues that our region is facing,” Stenger said.
“We talked about summer jobs for kids. We talked about after-school jobs. We talked about how important it is for folks and young people to get that feeling of a job well done,” Krewson said.Greitens left office Friday after a five-month-long scandal enveloped his administration. The self-described outsider had faced a felony charge for using a fundraising list from his former veterans charity to raise money for his political campaign. The charge was later dropped in an agreement with the St. Louis circuit attorney that resulted in his resignation.At the time, a separate House committee was compiling information that could have led to his impeachment and removal from office.
Krewson and Stenger described the meeting with Parson as warm and informative.“This was different than meetings with the last governor,” Stenger said.“I think that we’re going to have a really good working relationship with Gov. Parson,” Krewson said. “We share a lot of common concerns. I think he understands the importance of the St. Louis region to the economy of the state. As St. Louis does better, the whole state does better.”Parson, the former lieutenant governor, also met Wednesday with the state auditor and treasurer as he pushes to get up to speed on issues facing his fledgling administration.Treasurer Eric Schmitt said he briefed the governor on the state’s unfunded pension liability.“It’s the No. 1 threat to our triple A bond rating, so I’ve been focused on that,” Schmitt said.Parson is scheduled to address a joint session of the House and Senate on Monday.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Office may be called 'light gov,' but it’s still needed","Jun 6, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/columnists/office-may-be-called-light-gov-but-it-s-still/article_dfd8b4bc-3877-527f-92ce-34fa0c841fbc.html,"Although capital insiders refer to the lieutenant governor as “light gov,” we still need one. As Gov. Mike Parson can attest, Missouri’s lieutenant governor is not someone who just sits around waiting to take the reins temporarily when the governor is out of town.Our “light gov” fills other crucial roles, too. Our state constitution created a Senate with an even number (34) of senators. This design purposefully anticipated tie votes and an executive branch check on the Legislature. As the president of the Senate, our lieutenant governor casts tie-breaking votes, which can resolve simple procedural issues or be much more weighty.In 2000, when I was working in the Legislature, the November election led to neither party winning a Senate majority. The Republicans held a plurality of 16 seats. (There were 15 Democrats and three vacancies.) At times like that, the “light gov” can fill an extraordinarily heavy role.

As former Missouri Chief Justice Michael A. Wolff ably explained on this page last week, current law does not provide for the filling of this vacancy, and in my opinion, prevents the governor from appointing a lieutenant governor. See Mo. Rev. Stat. § 105.030. Nearly a hundred years ago, the Missouri Supreme Court ruled the governor had no authority to fill vacancies in a way that conflicts with applicable statute. By contrast, there is constitutional and statutorily provided process to fill all other elective state offices, either by appointment or special election.Gov. Parson says he is considering calling the Legislature into session to fix this problem. He should immediately do so. The cost is minimal, and the opportunity is prime.
Upon the tragic death of Gov. Mel Carnahan in 2000, Lt. Gov. Roger Wilson became governor and appointed Joe Maxwell as his successor. But because Maxwell had actually just been elected lieutenant governor (but had not yet assumed office), the issue fizzled. The issue resurfaced in 2013, briefly, when Lt. Gov. Peter Kinder ran for Congress. Gov. Jay Nixon said he could appoint Kinder’s successor if Kinder left office. Legislative leaders disagreed. Kinder wasn’t successful in his congressional bid, and the debate faded once again.
Since the Legislature is currently meeting in an unfortunately called and unprecedented “special” session, Gov. Parson calling a concurrent “extraordinary” session would impose little or no additional cost or time. (The terms “extraordinary” and “special” are constitutional terms-of-art. Suffice it to say, an “extraordinary” session is one called by the governor, and a “special” session is called by the Legislature itself.)Our state constitution mandates a minimum five-day process to pass a bill. The Legislature can accomplish this task in that short time frame (if it waives some of its normal procedural rules), and the entire membership of the House and Senate only need be present for one day each. Almost all of the work can be performed by presiding officers and committees, which reduced cost and time. And doing this in June — the final month of the fiscal year — further reduces any impact on the Legislature’s budget.In 2005, Gov. Matt Blunt called an extra session to pass an abortion-related bill. This took the Senate only three days and the House an additional five. If an abortion bill can be passed in eight days, this task should be a breeze. In fact, the Legislature has already considered and debated legislation as recently as this year on this very topic. It’s time to fix this issue and put the debate to rest.Stephen S. Davis is an attorney with the St. Louis office of Arent Fox LLP. He previously served as the 62nd chief clerk and administrator of the Missouri House of Representatives and as an assistant United States attorney."
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,CEO of Bi-State/Metro announces he's quitting in the fall,"Jun 5, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/ceo-of-bi-state-metro-announces-he-s-quitting-in/article_9a5444f9-88f3-5c1a-af0b-c3ba203440e8.html,"John Nations, who as president and CEO of the Bi-State Development Agency has overseen the Metro transit system for eight years, is quitting this fall.Nations, the longest-serving chief executive in Bi-State history, said Tuesday he’s leaving because he wants more quality time with his family and to pursue his many interests in legal and civic affairs.Nations, 55, insisted that his resignation has nothing to do with Bi-State’s clashes in recent years with St. Louis County government — the agency’s prime funding source — over how to improve security on MetroLink amid a spate of violent crimes on the light-rail system.

However, the squabbling over MetroLink was cited by a longtime member of Bi-State’s board and strong Nations supporter, former St. Louis Mayor Vincent C. Schoemehl Jr.“It is a testament to his leadership that after all of these years, the only thing people complain about relating to Bi-State operations is something Bi-State Development does not control, which is the policing of MetroLink in Missouri,” Schoemehl said.Schoemehl added that he believed Nations was “just worn out” by the “incessant sniping” and “the refusal of St. Louis County to fix the security” issue.County Executive Steve Stenger, who has criticized Nations in the past, took a diplomatic approach Tuesday, saying he wanted to focus now on the agency’s future.“I really don’t know that my opinion on how he handled his job really adds anything at this point,” Stenger said. He said he wished Nations well but also said “it’s going to be good to have a fresh perspective.”He added that when he and St. Louis Mayor Lyda Krewson meet jointly Wednesday with the new Missouri governor, Mike Parson, in Jefferson City, they will urge him to quickly appoint new Missouri members for the 10-member Bi-State board.“MetroLink security is going to be the top item on the agenda” for the meeting, Stenger said, referring to the request for new board members.Stenger and Krewson last summer sent Parson’s predecessor, Eric Greitens, lists of nominees to fill a board vacancy and to replace Missouri members whose terms technically expired. But Greitens never acted on them. Schoemehl would be among those replaced.Krewson could not be reached for comment Tuesday.Stenger’s opponent in the Aug. 7 Democratic primary, Mark Mantovani, said Nations’ resignation is “regrettable and a predictable reaction to the lack of cooperation” from Stenger on MetroLink matters. Schoemehl is a supporter of Mantovani’s candidacy.In response, Stenger said Mantovani’s comment amounted to “petty politics” and pointed out that it was he, Krewson and St. Clair County Board Chairman Mark Kern who took the initiative last year to form a joint task force to improve policing on MetroLink. Stenger added that Metro itself is ultimately responsible for light-rail security.
Metro officials have criticized St. Louis County police, who oversee the task force, for not presenting a more visible presence on MetroLink trains. County officials point out that they have more than doubled the number of police officers assigned to MetroLink and say that security has improved.There also have been other flashpoints, including the county prosecutor’s refusal to prosecute fare violation tickets written up by Metro security officers.Nations, a lawyer by training and occupation, took over as Bi-State’s CEO in 2010, resigning as Chesterfield’s mayor to do so.He was hired after running a successful campaign for a county sales tax increase for Metro earlier that year, producing the first infusion of new transit revenue in 15 years. Board members cited that as indicative of his ability to build partnerships in the community.
As CEO, Nations runs a $400 million-a-year operation with about 2,500 employees, 400 buses, a light-rail system with 37 stations, a paratransit van service, a general-aviation airport and various other endeavors.Among other things, the agency under his watch opened several new transit centers which act as regional hubs for bus and MetroLink service.Nations also noted that Bi-State at the request of area leaders has formed the St. Louis Regional Freightway, an organization pushing to build on the metro area’s importance in the freight industry.He also cited what he called “clean financial audits” and management performance audits in recent years with no criticisms. He also cited the agency’s getting private entities to kick in part of the cost of a new MetroLink station planned for the city’s Cortex area.Former U.S. Rep. Jerry Costello, D-Belleville, said Nations “by far” has been Bi-State’s best chief executive during Costello’s 30 years of working with the agency. Costello’s lobbying firm currently does work for the agency.But as at various other transit systems around the country, ridership has declined in recent years.To deal with that, Metro under Nations began a study of its bus operation expected to result in a major revamping, including the use of vans and ride-hailing services to replace low-ridership fixed bus routes in some suburban areas.Schoemehl said Tuesday that he and some other board members in an unsuccessful effort to convince Nations to stay offered to support boosting his pay above the current $325,000, which already makes him one of the area’s highest-salaried governmental officials.Schoemehl also said they were ready “to start the clock on a new five-year contract.” Nations’ current contract doesn’t expire until the end of 2020.Christine Byers of the Post-Dispatch contributed to this report.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri governor signals support for gas tax boost,"Jun 5, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-governor-signals-support-for-gas-tax-boost/article_9b2fbc11-0c4d-51c2-a4a9-fbd89a85f8f8.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Gov. Mike Parson offered initial support Tuesday for raising the state’s gasoline tax to help rebuild roads and bridges across Missouri.On his second full working day as governor, the man who took over for scandal-plagued Gov. Eric Greitens told reporters that improving the state’s transportation network will be a priority in his administration.“I’m going to be supporting infrastructure in the state of Missouri and, yes, if that’s part of the infrastructure plan,” he said. “I think that is important. We need to make sure we’ve got a good plan in place.”

Parson’s comments followed a meeting with a group of mayors from across the state, including Kansas City Mayor Sly James, St. Peters Mayor Len Pagano and Florissant Mayor Tom Schneider.James and his colleagues said they were pleased that Parson took time to meet with them and they share his concern about the state’s road and bridge system.“One of our major issues is infrastructure,” James said.“We cannot kick this can down the road any longer,” added Schneider. “Transportation has been neglected for over 20 years.”The meeting with mayors was among another packed day for Parson, who was sworn into office Friday after Greitens abruptly resigned. Greitens’ resignation followed an agreement with St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner that he would step down after just 17 months in office in exchange for her dropping a felony charge against him.In one of their final acts before adjourning for the spring, Missouri lawmakers agreed to place a question on the general election ballot calling for a phased-in 10-cent increase in the state’s 17-cent per gallon motor fuel tax.If approved, the state’s fuel tax for gas and diesel would rise 2.5-cents per year beginning in 2019, topping out at 27 cents in 2022. The proposal also would raise taxes on alternative fuels, including natural gas and propane.The increase would bring Missouri above the current national average of 24 cents per gallon, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
Analysts say the higher taxes could bring in an additional $293 million for the state road fund when it is fully implemented.The state has not raised gas taxes since the Legislature approved an increase in 1992. The 6-cent hike was phased in over four years.Along with speaking out on the gasoline tax, Parson said he would not be pushing to issue any low-income housing tax credits this year. Parson and Greitens had butted heads on the issue last year when Greitens moved to defund the program, citing insider dealing among developers.
“That is not something we’re going to deal with at the current time,” Parson said.Rather, he said he would form a commission to study the issue, which has been the subject of numerous blue ribbon panels and studies.“To even have a shot at returning, we’re going to have to have total reform,” Parson said.The governor is expected to meet Wednesday with St. Louis Mayor Lyda Krewson and St. Louis County Executive Steve Stenger as he ramps up his fledgling administration.Among Parson’s most recent hires were Marylyn Luetkemeyer as his executive assistant and Robert Knodell as his deputy chief of staff.Luetkemeyer was Parson’s former executive assistant when he was a senator and lieutenant governor.Knodell is former executive director of the House Republican Campaign Committee, former chief of staff for the Missouri House Pro Tem and a former budget and policy adviser to the chairman of the House Budget committee.Next week, Parson is scheduled to deliver a speech to a joint session of the House and Senate, appoint new members to the state school board and undertake a tour of the state.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Greitens' exit puts review of St. Louis death penalty case on hold,"Jun 5, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/greitens-exit-puts-review-of-st-louis-death-penalty-case/article_9e94eeb2-ffc9-5236-a615-ee3a9489803b.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • The abrupt resignation last week of former Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens has again put the fate of a man convicted of murdering a former Post-Dispatch reporter in limbo.













Marcellus Williams, who was convicted of fatally stabbing a former Post-Dispatch reporter in 1998, was set for execution, but the governor granted a stay.


Marcellus Williams, who was sentenced to death in connection with the 1998 murder of Lisha Gayle, was hours from being executed last August when Greitens stopped the process and invoked a rarely used state law to appoint a special board to review the case and recommend life or death.

That panel, which comprises five retired judges, had been scheduled to meet Tuesday. But, with Greitens’ departure and the swearing-in of new Gov. Mike Parson, the judges decided to cancel the meeting.“The board felt, in light of Governor Greitens’ resignation, it called into question whether our authority would continue after he left office,” said former U.S. District Judge Carol Jackson, who is chairing the panel.Jackson said the board didn’t want to presume that Parson would want to continue the process set forth by Greitens.“We felt like we needed to just put this on pause for a minute,” she said. “Governor Parson had nothing to do with the cancellation of the meeting.”The canceled meeting has raised red flags for some groups that had hoped Greitens would commute Williams’ sentence before his resignation was final, but a spokesman on Friday said Greitens wouldn’t make a decision before leaving because he wanted the special panel to continue its work.On Tuesday, the NAACP organized a rally in the capital city to shine a spotlight on the racial disparities of the death penalty in Missouri.“This process is so broken and steeped in patterns of systemic racism and prosecutorial misconduct that an innocent man came within just hours of execution by lethal injection,” NAACP Missouri conference President Nimrod Chapel said.“We think a lot of the problems are highlighted by the prosecution of Marcellus Williams,” Chapel added.Chapel said he is hopeful that the activists can meet soon with Parson to discuss the case.The fates of Williams and the board are among a lengthy list of items facing Parson. The former lieutenant governor is in the midst of hiring a staff to replace those who left with Greitens, including an attorney to take over for former general counsel Lucinda Luetkemeyer, who had overseen the formation of the special panel.
Parson spokeswoman Kelli Jones indicated the governor hasn’t decided what to do next.“The Board of Inquiry will suspend its work pending guidance from Governor Parson,” Jones said in a statement.













Lisha Gayle



Williams was convicted in 2001 of murdering Gayle at her home in University City. Prosecutors said Williams was burglarizing the home when Gayle, who had been taking a shower, surprised him. The former reporter, who left the paper in 1992, fought for her life as she was stabbed repeatedly.The Missouri Supreme Court in 2015 postponed Williams’ execution to allow time for the DNA tests. Using technology that was not available at the time of the killing, those tests show that DNA found on the knife matched that of an unknown male. Williams’ DNA was not found on the knife.Despite that finding, the state’s high court denied his petition to stop the execution and either appoint a special master to hear his innocence claim or vacate the death sentence and order his sentence commuted to life in prison.The panel formed by Greitens has met twice since it was formed. The first meeting was held in November, when the jurists received transcripts of Williams’ trial, information on DNA testing that was done in 2016 and other background information on Williams’ case, including opinions from various state and federal appeals.The second meeting came in March.Members of the panel are Jackson, former 22nd Circuit Judge Michael David, former Circuit Judge Peggy Fenner of Jackson County, former Missouri Court of Appeals Western District Judge Paul Spinden and former Circuit Judge Ellen Roper of Boone County.Jackson said the members were awaiting direction from Parson.“The board members are still interested in pursuing this issue,” she told the Post-Dispatch. “I’m hopeful that’s going to be resolved soon.”

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,New Missouri governor says he'll keep top agency heads hired by Greitens,"Jun 5, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/new-missouri-governor-says-he-ll-keep-top-agency-heads/article_a84ac863-bbcd-56cd-91d5-d3de69cdb6e9.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Hoping to project a calming presence after five months of political turbulence, Missouri’s new governor launched his first full working day in office in meetings Monday with a Cabinet left behind by his scandal-plagued predecessor.Gov. Mike Parson, who took over for fellow Republican Eric Greitens on Friday, told reporters in a briefing outside his new office that he has no plans to replace agency directors whom Greitens selected to run the state.That includes Greitens’ controversial pick of Drew Erdmann as the state’s chief operating officer, a post that drew initial criticism because of his $125,000 salary.

“Gov. Greitens brought together a good team to the state of Missouri. I don’t anticipate any changes in the Cabinet. There are a lot of good things that’s going on in the state of Missouri,” the former lieutenant governor said.On Monday evening, he announced that Aaron Willard would be his chief of staff. Willard was part of President Donald Trump’s transition team and has been as chief of staff to several Missouri House speakers.Parson, a former state lawmaker and county sheriff, ascended to the state’s top office Friday after the spectacular flameout of Greitens, who had national aspirations before becoming buried by legal problems.Greitens announced his resignation Tuesday after prosecutors in St. Louis agreed to drop a felony charge related to his use of a charity donor list for political fundraising.But, Greitens faces other legal and possible legislative actions, including attempts by a Missouri House committee to determine the funding sources of a nonprofit organization formed to support his agenda, as well as a lawsuit related to the use of a special phone app that destroys text messages.While the jobs of agency directors appear to be safe, many top positions within the governor’s immediate staff remain unfilled after the mass resignations of Greitens’ inner circle.On Monday, Parson hired Rep. Justin Alferman, R-Hermann, to fill the vacant legislative director post. He hired Steele Shippy away from Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft’s staff to be his communications director.Other notable changes included the attire of holdover staffers and members of Parson’s security detail. Greitens had fashioned a casual look while in office, wearing jeans, boots and shirts without ties on most days. That look was gone Monday, replaced by suits and ties.“Even though it’s going to be a little different day in the governor’s office — how I function as the governor of the state of Missouri — we’re going to be working together,” Parson said.In the coming days, Parson is expected to meet with mayors from across the state, including St. Louis Mayor Lyda Krewson.“We want to learn about what their issues are,” Parson said.The new governor, a Bolivar resident who raises cattle, also is planning a joint address to the House and Senate on Monday.
Among the top issues on the to-do list is determining how to fill the now-vacant lieutenant governor’s position.“It needs to be done. I don’t like the state of Missouri being without a lieutenant governor,” Parson said.The Missouri Constitution outlines the duties of the job, which mainly involves casting tie-breaking votes in the Senate. State law also dictates that the governor-in-waiting sit on several boards and commissions.But the constitution includes no sentences on how a lieutenant governor should be replaced.In 2013, Parson supported legislation that would have called for a special election to fill the seat. It was vetoed by former Gov. Jay Nixon.
Parson is now not saying whether he will move to fill the post himself, saying the issue is under study.“Hopefully, we’ll check out the legalities of it and figure out what it is. But that will be a priority to figure out what we’re going to do with the lieutenant governor’s position,” Parson said.In addition to talking with agency chiefs, Parson spent time Monday morning on a call with U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue. Spokeswoman Kelli Jones said the new administration has reached out to the White House, but the governor himself has not spoken with President Donald Trump.The White House for months tried to keep a distance from the Greitens scandal, despite the fact that Trump had twice appeared in the state with the governor, and despite the fact that Greitens had been advised during the 2016 campaign by Nick Ayers, of staff to Vice President Mike Pence.On Monday, at White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders’ regular briefing, she was asked whether Trump or anyone else in the White House had encouraged Greitens to resign.“I’m not aware of any conversations directly with the president or with anyone here at the White House,” Sanders said.Ayers, through the White House communications office, has said he has not been contacted by anyone looking into Greitens’ campaign.Chuck Raasch of the Post-Dispatch contributed to this report from Washington.Note: Story updated on June 6, 2018 to correct amount of Drew Erdmann's salary.

Gov. Mike Parson other than that I disagree with his position on just about everything. However, I was very impressed with how he took the high road during the Gov. Eric Greitens debacle and I thought his comment on it was true class.

I have heard and read that he is respected and very well liked by members of the legislature. That in and of itself is a positive change over Greitens’ time in office. So maybe now something can be accomplished.
This ultra-liberal wishes the very best to incoming Gov. Parson in his new position.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Mike Parson pledges fresh start as he is sworn in as Missouri's new governor,"Jun 2, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/mike-parson-pledges-fresh-start-as-he-is-sworn-in/article_4e0baef3-1e58-5772-8719-7ea706aaa4bc.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Swept into office amid a historic scandal, Republican Mike Parson, a farmer and former sheriff with a wealth of Capitol experience, called for a “fresh start” Friday as he was formally installed as Missouri’s 57th governor.“Public service is a privilege,” the former lieutenant governor said after being sworn in by Missouri Supreme Court Judge Mary Russell.Pledging to bring “honor, integrity and transparency” to an office that has operated under a cloud for months, the Republican said: “I am optimistic about the future of our great state, and I’m looking forward to the work ahead.”

His predecessor, Eric Greitens, officially left his $133,000-per-year job at 5 p.m. Friday after a final, frenetic outburst of activity.In a one-line letter submitted Friday, Greitens formally resigned. Before leaving, Greitens took action on 77 bills sent to him by the House and Senate.












        

        
            Eric Greitens' official resignation letter

The letter Eric Greitens submitted Friday resigning from the office of Missouri governor.




Among the bills approved: a cut in the corporate income tax rate and new rules for how utility rates for companies such as Ameren are regulated.In addition, Greitens pardoned five people and commuted four sentences as he ended his 17-month tenure as an outsider Republican who came to the capital city to clean up politics.

Greitens left with his political future in tatters. On Friday, he was greeted by more legal woes.In a ruling by Cole County Circuit Judge Jon Beetem, Greitens and his employees were ordered to submit a list of phone numbers, names and phone models of anyone in the governor’s office who used the Confide app, which destroys text messages immediately after they are read.While Greitens was scrambling to close out his abbreviated stint as chief executive, his wife tweeted out a note of thanks.“It has been an honor & privilege to serve as First Lady of my adopted state. I’m grateful to have had the chance to work w/so many who came together to protect & care for our kids, & for time in this wonderful home for our boys,” first lady Sheena Greitens wrote.The moving van left the governor’s mansion about 1 p.m. In the Capitol, Greitens’ staffers hauled boxes and other personal items out of their suite of offices on the second floor to make way for Parson.Many of Greitens’ top aides won’t be back after the weekend.“I am deeply grateful for having had the chance to serve the people of Missouri. And I will always remember the team that I had the opportunity to serve alongside,” Greitens’ policy director Will Scharf tweeted.Parson, meanwhile, called his ascension a “huge undertaking” but said he would bring stability to the office.“We’re in the planning stage. We’re in the transition part,” Parson told reporters outside his office before his swearing-in ceremony. “It is a daunting task in two or three days to prepare to be governor of the state of Missouri.”Afterwards, in short remarks before family, friends and the media in his new office, Parson pledged to restore order to a state government that has been besieged for the past five months after Greitens admitted having an extramarital affair in 2015.“We have an opportunity today to have a fresh start in state government. I believe now is a time for Missouri to come together,” he said.Among the top tasks facing him when he returns to work Monday will include finding employees to replace those who left with Greitens. He also must remake the state school board, which has not met since January because of an ongoing squabble between the Senate and Greitens’ decision to stack the board to oust former schools Commissioner Margie Vandeven.He said he would move quickly to bring new members on the board.Parson also said he believed he had the power to appoint a lieutenant governor to replace him.“I think that’s an important position,” Parson said.
He said he hoped to heal the rifts created by Greitens by uniting Missourians behind issues such as infrastructure and improving workforce development.Although he had not spoken with Greitens, his wife, Theresa Parson, told reporters she had received a phone call from Mrs. Greitens Friday afternoon.“They are almost packed up and ready to leave. We’re going to go over in the morning and take a look,” Mrs. Parson said.

The Confide lawsuit, which was filed by the Sunshine Project, focuses on whether using the app violated state laws designed to provide transparency in government.
Lawyer Mark Pedroli said the ruling had resulted in the identification of 20 people in the office of governor, including the governor, who used Confide. “This means they can’t destroy the evidence,” Pedroli said.A previous investigation by Attorney General Josh Hawley of the governor’s office use of Confide concluded that only eight office staffers had used the app.Greitens’ office had no response to the decision, which is just one of the legal problems hanging over his head.On Wednesday, felony charges against Greitens for taking the donor list from The Mission Continues were dropped by St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner in exchange for his leaving office.But he still faces an investigation by Hawley and a separate probe by a special House committee that was investigating his potential impeachment. Lawmakers also have spoken to the Federal Bureau of Investigation about potential legal breaches by the governor.Hawley, meanwhile, briefed Parson Friday on lawsuits affecting the state. He left the meeting saying Parson was well-equipped to step into the role.“I think that the incoming governor is prepared. I was extremely impressed with the work that he has done in 48 hours. It’s really remarkable,” Hawley said.Other state officials weighed in on Parson’s new post.“Mike Parson became sheriff of Polk County the same week I became the president of Southwest Baptist University in Bolivar in 1993,” U.S. Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo, said. “As a county official, an effective state legislator and lieutenant governor, he understands our state in ways that few people do. He will be a great governor, and I look forward to helping him in any way I can.”U.S. Rep. Ann Wagner, R-Ballwin, said of Parson: “His integrity and extensive experience in law enforcement, public service and on his family’s farm have equipped him to provide the thoughtful leadership our state needs. I am grateful for his and the first lady’s willingness to serve the state of Missouri, and I stand ready to assist the new administration as it takes the reins.”At 4 p.m., Parson attended a prayer service at First Baptist Church in Jefferson City, which was presided over by his brother, Kent, a Baptist minister from Elkton.Among the attendees were members of the Parsons’ Sunday school class from Bolivar. Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft led the congregation in two hymns.The Parsons are expected to return to their cattle operation in Polk County later Saturday after they tour the mansion.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Editorial: Dark money giveth Eric Greitens, and taketh away","Jun 2, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-dark-money-giveth-eric-greitens-and-taketh-away/article_dfe2e160-ae32-583a-8dd8-153f628fb423.html,"The bizarre 17-month Eric Greitens era in Missouri government ended quietly on Friday afternoon. Missourians surely want and deserve to move on from the arrogance, the secrecy, the stonewalling and the sleaze that dominated the news in recent months.Mike Parson, who just five days ago as lieutenant governor had plenty of time to work cattle on his Polk County ranch, must now rebuild the executive branch. It will take some time, but normalcy can return to state government. Parson is as conservative as Greitens pretended to be, but should be a far less divisive figure.But before Missouri moves on, some questions need to be answered. They fall into two broad categories: How did this happen? What can be done to make sure it doesn’t happen again?

The answers to both questions have to do with money — millions upon millions of dollars in campaign contributions, secret and fully disclosed alike. More than $17 million of Greitens’ campaign money was paid to a California consulting firm where Nick Ayers, a Georgia-based strategist who is now Vice President Mike Pence’s chief of staff, was a partner. Greitens’ campaign began with local supporters he had met through The Mission Continues, the veterans charity he’d founded and later exploited, but more than any other individual, Ayers, the 35-year-old Georgia whiz kid, is responsible for Greitens’ election.He looked at Greitens’ résumé — Rhodes scholar, Navy SEAL, veterans charity founder, best-selling author — and determined to make him governor. Never mind that he had no working knowledge of state government nor any discernible allegiance to the Republican Party.Ayers brought in other Georgia guys like Austin Chambers and Roberts Edens Davis who helped run Greitens’ campaign. They turned him into a Stepford candidate, one with bumper-sticker appeal to Missouri’s white rural and suburban Republican base and disdain for the state party establishment.Ayers has a reputation as a dark-money wizard, someone who served as a liaison between rich business interests and the Republican Governors’ Association, selling tickets on someone who could be president someday. Greitens jump-started the campaign with $2 million raised from donors to The Mission Continues. After that it was dark money and money from out-of-state donors with no particular interest in Missouri that won the primary.One of the matters that must be cleared up before the Greitens saga is closed is whether that money was acquired and used legally. Felony charges have been dropped — one for taking a nude photograph of a woman during a sexual encounter in 2015, the other for exploiting his veterans charity.But the mere possibility that the House committee investigating the charges against Greitens would begin digging into the dark money panicked Greitens’ backers and brought pressure to resign. Within hours of Cole County Circuit Judge Jon Beetem’s decision Tuesday that Greitens and his finances were fair game for the House committee, Greitens announced his resignation.
His lawyers — and he had a lot of them, most paid by mysterious sources — had anticipated Beetem’s decision. They cut a deal last weekend with St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner: She’d drop the felony charge related to the donor list and Greitens would resign.Parts of the deal were redacted, which is simply not appropriate for a judicial officer and a state official. No one knows details of what both sides promised. The public has a right to know what was done in its name.The House investigative committee wants to continue probing the Greitens’ campaign’s finances, but it may no longer have jurisdiction. Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley could investigate the possibility of fraud. He should do so. Judge Rex Burlison should reconsider his decision to allow secret parts to the deal.
Yes, it’s good that Greitens is gone. But not all the secrets in the Greitens’ saga took place in the basement gym of his home in 2015. Lawmakers, judges and the prosecutor should refuse to blindfold Missouri citizens.To that end, the Legislature must codify the opinion issued May 10 by James Klahr, the executive director of the Missouri Ethics Commission: States write their own election laws. Never mind that courts have allowed dark money to proliferate in federal elections. Nonprofits that donate to Missouri political campaigns can’t conceal the identities of their donors.Backers of the so-called “Clean Missouri” ballot initiative have submitted signatures to get a comprehensive ethics measure on the state ballot in November. Had it been in effect in 2016, it might have been harder for Ayers’ Georgia cabal to stage the Greitens coup.Missouri got rolled. A handful of people, most with limited experience in Missouri politics, managed to elect an utter novice with a fabulous résumé and no discernible political qualifications beyond naked ambition, to the state’s highest office.They may not have known about his personal problems, but they knew his ethics were malleable. He could keep a secret; in fact, he loved keeping secrets, as indicated by his reluctance to answer questions from reporters and lawmakers; his use of a dark-money committee to attack lawmakers, his penchant for burner phones and heavy use of the Confide app that makes text messages disappear.With his remarkable résumé, his talent and good looks, Greitens seemed like the total package. But as Gertrude Stein said in a different context, there was no there there, only relentless ambition. Unless Missouri regains control of its government from moneyed interests, it could happen again."
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Here are the bills Gov. Eric Greitens signed before leaving office,"Jun 1, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/here-are-the-bills-gov-eric-greitens-signed-before-leaving/article_d2132b21-8db0-5d50-bed6-1d8ad4ec34b0.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Before leaving office Friday, Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens scrambled to sign 77 pieces of legislation into law, including a cut in the corporate tax rate and a change in the way utility companies such as Ameren receive rate adjustments.He also approved a measure making “revenge porn” illegal. Greitens was accused of taking a semi-nude photo of his then-lover and threatening her with its release if she ever told of the affair.Among the measures the governor did not sign was a reduction in the state’s individual income tax rate. A decision on that legislation, as well as dozens more bills that remain pending, will be up to new Gov. Mike Parson.

Here’s a look at some of the significant pieces of legislation approved by Greitens in the hours before he formally resigned from office:Fake meat • Bans lab-grown meat products or meat substitutes from being labeled as “meat.” (SB 627)Utility rates • Provides for a 5 percent rate reduction this year, a rate freeze until 2020 and then rate caps moving forward for monopoly utility companies, such as Ameren. Critics are concerned rates will rise over the long term. (SB 564)Water rates • Allows monopoly utility companies to increase fees for water service if they don’t make the expected amount from utility rates. (SB 705)Telephone company taxes • Allows telephone companies to choose a different way to be taxed, which is expected to drastically reduce revenue for school districts. (SB 768)Historic tax credits • Pares back a program intended to entice developers to restore dilapidated buildings. (SB 590, amendment to SB 773)Being tried as an adult for crimes • Increases the minimum age to be tried as an adult to 18 from 17 years old. (SB 793)
Coal ash • Gives the state more regulatory control over disposal of industrial waste that can contaminate groundwater, but critics worry it will lead to less oversight over safe practices. (SB 917)Out-of-network health costs • Codifies consumer protections for Missourians in an attempt to ensure they’re not stuck with large bills for emergency services deemed out of their insurance network. (SB 982)Merit system • Reclassifies state workers as at-will employees, making it easier to hire and fire them. Greitens made small raises for state employees, who are already some of the lowest paid in the country, contingent on this passing. Also includes an amendment that restores protections for state employees who report abuses that were stripped in last year’s Senate Bill 43. (SB 1007)
Public-sector unions • Requires state employees to opt in to have union dues withdrawn from their paychecks. (HB 1413)Hair braiding • Loosens licensing requirements for people who braid hair. (HB 1500)Revenge porn • Bans posting online a naked photo or video of someone without their permission. (HB 1558)Bi-State Development expansion • Includes Franklin County in the Bi-State Development Agency, which could open the area up for public transportation. (HB 1809)Industrial hemp • Allows businesses to grow and harvest hemp, which has a negligible amount of THC, the intoxicating part of pot. (HB 2034)Corporate tax cuts • Decreases the corporate income tax rate to 4 percent from 6.25 percent. (SB 884)Addicted mothers • Expands Medicaid coverage for new mothers struggling with addiction. (HB 2280)

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Short takes: Misplaced civility, news priorities and rejected recyling","Jun 1, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/editorial/short-takes-misplaced-civility-news-priorities-and-rejected-recyling/article_b97c0443-e980-505f-a397-c4cb09927fb2.html,"SBUX for unityIt’s easy to poke fun at Starbucks for its foofoo coffee and jacked-up prices, but the chain deserves credit for its effort to instruct about 175,000 employees in racial-bias training.The coffee giant closed more than 8,000 U.S. stores for four hours on Tuesday to kick off the training, and paid all employees who participated. The closures could cost $16.7 million in lost sales, according to Bloomberg media.

Starbucks’ image as a welcoming place to hang out, look at your computer and get caffeinated took a big hit in April when a manager at a Philadelphia store called the police because two black men were sitting there waiting for a friend.The men were arrested for no reason, causing a social media firestorm. Starbucks’ leaders apologized profusely, arranged a financial settlement with the men and parted ways with the manager. They say the training sessions were the first step in an ongoing attempt to teach employees about discrimination. For the company that got the nation hooked on venti-size coffee, teaching employees some venti-size consciousness is not a bad idea.Mayor NiceLike many elected officials, St. Louis Mayor Lyda Krewson opened Twitter, inserted foot. After Gov. Eric Greitens’ resignation Tuesday, the mayor chose moderation, thanking him for his service. Krewson got a timeline-full of hostility from St. Louisans and some Democratic officials who called her tone-deaf and questioned why she would be so polite to a governor who savaged St. Louis.In reply, Krewson tweeted Wednesday morning: “It is said that the road to hell is paved with good intention …,” she wrote, adding that Greitens’ actions were “inexcusable, embarrassing and disgusting.” She said her tweet from the day before was “well intended but missed the mark.”She tweeted further, apologizing for choosing civility and saying it was past time for Greitens to get the message, and that she looked forward to working with incoming Gov. Mike Parson.Like “The buck stops here” sign that Harry S Truman kept on his desk, modern politicians should have one that says, “Think first, tweet later.”Roseanne 20, Puerto Rico 1The progressive website Media Matters reports that on Tuesday, the three major cable news networks devoted more than 10 hours of coverage to ABC’s decision to cancel Roseanne Barr’s popular TV show because of a racist tweet. Meanwhile, the news that the death toll in Puerto Rico from Hurricane Maria last September may have been 72 times higher than official estimates got a grand total of 30 minutes of coverage.This is an old conundrum for people in the news business: Celebrity news drives viewers and readers far more than serious news. Wednesday’s print edition of the Post-Dispatch carried 13 paragraphs on the Roseanne story on page A10, but skipped the hurricane deaths entirely. In our defense, Gov. Eric Greitens’ resignation ate five news pages that day. Stltoday.com, the online version of the newspaper, covered the hurricane death study extensively.
Harvard public health researchers carried out a scientific survey of the island’s residents to come up with a conservative estimate of 4,645 deaths attributable to the disaster. The official death toll is 64. If celebrities had been among the victims, the coverage might have been more extensive.No assault rifles? No problemAfter the Feb. 14 mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Fla., executives at Dick’s Sporting Goods announced the company would no longer sell assault-style rifles like the one used to kill 17 people. Dick’s said it would no longer sell high-capacity magazines, either, and would raise the minimum age to purchase guns to 21.The company braced for a backlash, and this week came the first quarterly earnings report since the decision in February: Sales were up as much as 27 percent and earnings guidance was raised by 12 cents per share.Smart gun policy is smart business.
Why mass shootings? PornWhile we’re on the subject, U.S. Rep. Diane Black, R-Tenn., thinks she’s identified the core problems that lead to mass shootings: violent movies, the breakdown of the family and easy access to pornography in grocery stores.“Pornography. It’s available. It’s available on the shelf when you walk in the grocery store. Yeah, you have to reach up to get it, but there’s pornography there,” Black told a group of pastors last week. “All of this is available without parental guidance.”She might be shocked to learn porn is available online, so kids don’t even have to go to the grocery store to paw through all the gun magazines to get to the porn. Black is a candidate for the GOP nomination for governor. Good luck with that, Tennessee.Why recycling bins are blueSo you’ve been diligently separating paper, plastic, aluminum, cardboard and glass and putting it into a blue recycling dumpster or a bin you haul to the curb. Here’s some bad news: Since Jan. 1, China — which used to accept most of the recycled materials from the United States — no longer wants it.“All of a sudden, material being collected on the street doesn’t have a place to go,” Pete Keller of Republic Services, one of the largest waste managers in the country, told the New York Times this week.A few bulk recyclers have been able to find new markets, but it’s a low-margin operation. The trashy little secret is that all that stuff you’re so carefully sorting and recycling may be winding up in the landfill, anyway."
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Greitens said it: Memorable quotes that marked his candidacy, governorship","Jun 1, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/greitens-said-it-memorable-quotes-that-marked-his-candidacy-governorship/article_aa4c6678-2482-56ff-af43-c7c13ec8cfe4.html,"Eric Greitens launched his campaign for governor in 2015, vowing to root out public corruption in Jefferson City.He took aim at his predecessor Jay Nixon for his handling of the Ferguson unrest, saying he could have ended the violence in two days.He criticized efforts to get state funding for a soccer stadium in St. Louis, calling it ""corporate welfare.""

And he took aim at the powerful low-income tax credit industry, saying it was time to end ""politics as usual.""Combative to the end, the former Navy SEAL insisted Tuesday he had committed no crimes — and said ""history and God"" would ""bring justice.""Here is Eric Greitens, in his own words:• “I want to say now, to the corrupt insiders who have been working Jefferson City for decades to maximize their personal profit rather than to serve the people, your days are numbered! I will defeat you, I will expose your lies, I will root out your corruption, and I will see you out of the people’s Capitol, even if in sight of the statue of Thomas Jefferson I have to throw you down the steps of the Capitol myself!” — Greitens jumps into Missouri gov race with money advantage; Brunner on deck  [Sept. 27, 2015]• “Oh, John Brunner, oh my God, you are such a weasel!

            Post-Dispatch coverage of the Greitens affair scandal

From Greitens' initial statement to the legal battle, read the Post-Dispatch coverage of the governor's scandal. 




• “To be very clear, I have completely ruled out state funding for stadiums. … We are not going to use money from the people of the state of Missouri for what I believe is corporate welfare. We’ve got far too many core priorities of government that have to be invested in.” — Greitens: 'I have completely ruled out state funding for stadiums' [Jan. 2, 2017]• “We are fighting to bring more jobs to the people of Missouri. Some career politicians failed to do their jobs and then went home. That’s wrong. We’re canceling their summer vacations and calling a special session to get this done.” — Missouri governor calling lawmakers back for special session [May 18, 2017]• “We promised that we were going to clean up the culture of corruption in Jefferson City. As governor, I will always hold myself and my team to the highest possible standard.” — Greitens pledges end to 'politics as usual,' and shows it with his first official act [Jan. 10, 2017]
• “The organization that you're referring to [A New Missouri] is one that I have no day-to-day responsibilities with. It's an organization that's separate from the governor's office. It does represent the interests of thousands of people around the state of Missouri who care about seeing our priorities get passed.” — Greitens: 'I have no day-to-day responsibilities' with nonprofit attacking Republican senator [April 24, 2017]• ""We zeroed out this failing program, and saved tens of millions of dollars. No. More. Giveaways. … We're here to work with people across Missouri, on both sides of the aisle, to do what works. But let's be clear: Politics as usual is over."" — Greitens, appointees move to withhold controversial low income development tax credits  [Nov. 17, 2017]• “This was a consensual relationship. There was no blackmail, there was no violence, there was no threat of violence, there was no threat of blackmail, there was no threat of using a photograph for blackmail. All of those things are false.” — Greitens: 'No blackmail,' 'no violence' in affair  [Jan. 22, 2018]

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,New governor will take over in Missouri after tumultuous tenure of Eric Greitens,"Jun 1, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/new-governor-will-take-over-in-missouri-after-tumultuous-tenure/article_7f81f568-e727-5a21-ae3a-c99467d9335c.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Lt. Gov. Mike Parson will be sworn in as Missouri’s 57th governor Friday in a low-key event in the governor’s office.In a nod to the circumstances of his ascension to the state’s highest office, the 62-year-old Republican will hold a private prayer service at 4 p.m. followed by his formal swearing-in ceremony in the Capitol by Missouri Supreme Court Judge Mary Russell.














        
            Missouri's next governor: Mike Parson





Parson will take over for Gov. Eric Greitens, who announced Tuesday he would resign effective Friday at 5 p.m.Advisers said the lack of fireworks surrounding Parson’s taking over was designed to portray the longtime lawmaker and former Polk County sheriff as bringing stability to a state that has been rocked by criminal allegations against Greitens and a move by the Legislature to consider impeaching him.Since learning that he’d be taking over for his GOP counterpart, Parson has spent his days in his second-floor office in meetings and on phone calls. He has made no public appearances nor held press conferences.On Thursday, the former state lawmaker was scheduled to receive a briefing from the Missouri Department of Public Safety’s State Emergency Management Agency and finalize the details of the swearing-in ceremony.Since Tuesday, Parson has spoken to U.S. Sens. Roy Blunt and Claire McCaskill, and all eight members of Missouri’s congressional delegation. He has also spoken to Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft, state Auditor Nicole Galloway and Attorney General Josh Hawley. In addition, he has spoken to St. Louis Mayor Lyda Krewson and Kansas City Mayor Sly James.Hoping to ease the transition from a small statewide office with just a handful of employees to a job that oversees more than 50,000 employees spread across multiple departments, House and Senate leaders have lent Parson some of their staff to assist with the work.














        
            Trouble lurked between the lines of Greitens' perfect story

In hindsight, though, Greitens’ spectacular flame-out over the past five months, ending with his edge-of-tears announcement Tuesday that he is…




Senate President Pro Tem Ron Richard, R-Joplin, said the staff help would be temporary.“That’s all it amounts to, just a week or two. Nothing serious,” Richard said.In one sense, Parson was already being treated like the governor. Stationed outside his office were two members of the Missouri Highway Patrol security detail, who have watched over Greitens for the past 17 months.Along with getting a detail to ferry him around the state, Parson will see his pay rise to $133,820, up from his lieutenant governor’s salary of $86,484.The cost of the governor’s security detail in 2017 was $2.4 million, according to figures compiled by the highway patrol. Security costs during former Gov. Jay Nixon’s administration were $2 million in 2015 and $2.1 million in 2016, the patrol said.Greitens, meanwhile, was splitting time working in his Capitol office and working to move out of the nearby Governor’s Mansion heading into the final day of his tumultuous 17-month tenure, spokesman Parker Briden told the Post-Dispatch.
Briden said staff members were reviewing legislation sent to the governor to determine if he wants to sign bills into law before leaving for his home in Innsbrook, or leave that task for Parson.“There were some legislative initiatives that he supported. He’d like to be able to sign those into law,” Briden said.














        
            How it went down: Governor's attorneys proposed he resign in return for dropped charge

  




The governor and his legal team also are facing a deadline to turn over records relating to a House investigation into his possible impeachment that was underway when he announced his resignation.
It has been an honor & privilege to serve as First Lady of my adopted state. I'm grateful to have had the chance to work w/so many who came together to protect & care for our kids, & for time in this wonderful home for our boys. Thank you. May God bless the people of Missouri. pic.twitter.com/irevJaVppd— Sheena Greitens (@SheenaGreitens) June 1, 2018

On Friday morning, Greitens' wife, Sheena, sent out a farewell message on Twitter thanking the people of Missouri and saying it had been an ""honor and privilege"" to serve as First Lady.The House leadership expects Greitens for Missouri, his campaign fund, and A New Missouri, a dark-money nonprofit dedicated to advancing his agenda, to turn over records of communications between the two entities and other information by 5 p.m. Friday — the exact time Greitens is scheduled to leave office, a spokesman said.In an email Thursday, one of his attorneys, former House Speaker Catherine Hanaway, said: “We won’t violate the order.”The governor also announced a few low-level appointments to boards and commissions Thursday.“He wants to make sure we sprint through the finish line,” Briden said.Briden also will be leaving his post on Friday. He will be among an expected exodus of Greitens aides who will depart alongside their former boss, leaving Parson to build a new team to help him operate the office.The exit of Greitens and elevation of Parson also have triggered another statewide official to take action.In an announcement Thursday, Galloway announced her office will conduct audits of the governor and lieutenant governor. The auditor typically performs closeout audits of statewide offices to assist in transitions and ensure that incoming officials are aware of areas for improvement.Galloway, a Democrat, said she notified the two offices of the audits and reminded them that documents must be preserved. Auditors will review office operations and financial activity through the last day of the statewide elected officials’ service.Closeout audits were last conducted in 2017 when the current officials took office. The governor’s office under the previous administration received a rating of “fair” in the audit released in August 2017. The previous administration of the lieutenant governor’s office received an overall performance rating of “good” in the audit released April 2017.Kurt Erickson • 573-556-6181 @KurtEricksonPD on Twitter kerickson@post-dispatch.com

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,New Missouri governor has far different view from Greitens on controversial low-income tax credits,"Jun 1, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/business/local/new-missouri-governor-has-far-different-view-from-greitens-on/article_6df0ca15-a9e4-58b2-b22a-25b040c44d73.html,"In his 16 months in office, former Gov. Eric Greitens managed to roil the politically powerful industry that has sprung up around low-income housing tax credits.His appointees to the Missouri Housing Development Commission, the body that oversees which projects are awarded credits, maneuvered last year to keep the state from issuing about $140 million in credits through a program that has long been a political flashpoint.














        
            With status of Greitens' probe in limbo, transition of new Missouri governor begins





There have since been suggestions that some in the industry may have even been behind part of the $120,000 given to the attorney representing the ex-husband of Greitens’ former mistress. The recordings the ex-husband took of his then-wife discussing the affair triggered a wave of scrutiny that ultimately led to Greitens announcing his resignation Tuesday.The commission vote was also one of the most noteworthy breaks in policy between Greitens and former Lt. Governor Mike Parson, who was sworn in as governor Friday.Now, some organizations that use the credits are hopeful Parson will take a less confrontational stance with the industry.














        
            Is Missouri's costly housing tax credit untouchable because of industry's clout?



Both Republican statewide officeholders sit on the housing commission, and while Greitens voted against the issuance of state credits, Parson decried the move and argued any reforms to the program should be debated in the Legislature. Past attempts to reform the credits have failed there.“If we want to talk about reform, let’s talk about reform,” Parson said at the November MHDC meeting. “If we’re going to do away with it, it should be the governor and the Legislature that do away with it.”The MHDC has typically approved matching the amount of federal low income housing credits allocated to Missouri, and the late 2017 action by the commission withholding the state match sent developers who use the credits to finance projects scrambling to adjust their plans. Mark Stroker, director of real estate development at St. Louis nonprofit Rise Community Development, said he expects about one-third fewer housing units to be financed due to the lack of state credits this year.Adding to the uncertainty, the commission still has to award the federal credits, and it’s not clear when it will have enough members to do so. Four of Greitens’ appointees resigned following last year’s action rather than face a hostile confirmation process in the state senate. And when Greitens resigned Friday, there were only five members left on the commission, one short of a quorum.“It’s a road we have not been down before,” said Eric McMahon, a partner at St. Louis-based ND Consulting, which through an affiliated company has an application in for federal credits to finance an apartment project in Moberly.














        
            Messenger: Sordid Greitens saga leaving casualties strewn across the Missouri battle field



The credits are awarded to developers who use them to finance projects and in return agree to charge below-market rents.Long before Greitens burst onto the political scene, the credits were controversial. His Democratic predecessor, Gov. Jay Nixon, criticized the program. State audits from both Republicans and Democrats have said it is inefficient, pointing out less than 50 cents on the dollar goes to housing construction while the rest of the value goes to financiers and middlemen or is lost over time because the credits are paid out over 10 years.
Long term, some $1.3 billion are outstanding and could be redeemed in future years, according to a state audit last year. The uncertainty over how much will be redeemed each year complicates the state budgeting process.But supporters say it’s one of the few mechanisms left to fund low-income housing because federal funds for similar programs have been slashed over the years. And it often funds some of the only new construction in the state’s poorest areas, including neighborhoods of north St. Louis that see relatively little investment.

“Over the past year, Governor Greitens repeatedly made material misstatements regarding the state low-income housing tax credit program,” Jeff Smith, executive director of industry group Missouri Workforce Housing Association, said in a statement (Smith is not the Columbia developer who is a prolific user of the credits). “Like bipartisan supporters of the LIHTC program in the state legislature and in Congress, we know that this program is the most efficient and effective way to preserve our shrinking supply of affordable housing.”Stroker, at the nonprofit Rise, called the low income credit an “indispensable resource” and “one of our best tools for remaking and redeveloping neighborhoods.”
Between the actions from Greitens’ administration and federal tax cuts that affected the credits’ value, organizations like Rise have had to look to other sources of funding to plug the gap on projects. Rise is involved with three applications for federal credits this round, and Stroker said Rise would “be happy to get one of our three applications funded.”“The biggest challenge has been trying to read the tea leaves,” he said.But he and others are optimistic that Parson will take a less hostile approach to the industry. Ken Nuernberger, an ND Consulting co-founder, said Parson has shown a willingness to learn how the industry works and visited some of ND’s projects using the low-income credits in north St. Louis’s Hyde Park neighborhood.“Parson has really shown an interest in the low-income housing industry,” Nuernberger said.Stroker, at Rise, said Parson has “been supportive and he’s been accessible. And that was not the case with Gov. Greitens.”“(Parson) comes to our conferences and looks at the work that gets done with the benefit of the credits and asks questions and has stayed engaged,” he said.When the MHDC moved toward cutting off the state credits in November, Parson invited Sen. Jamilah Nasheed, D-St. Louis, to speak during the meeting in support of retaining some of the state credits. Nasheed said she supports the program because of how the credits have helped the “transformation in neighborhoods throughout the city of St. Louis.”“I do know that (Parson) has been a strong supporter of the low-income housing tax credit because he truly understands the economic impact for the state,” she said.She suspects discussions about the program’s future to continue. Both Rise and ND Consulting say they’re also open to discussions about reform and efficiency.“Almost everyone I know would be willing to be engaged in that discussion,” Nuernberger said. “But continuity and consistency would be nice to get back to.”

It was 2008, I think. Parson was a second-term Republican state representative from Bolivar. He had been sheriff in Polk County. He would go on to become a state senator and lieutenant governor. We were introduced by a lobbyist.On Friday about 5:30 p.m., Parson will be sworn in as Missouri’s 57th governor.He will be a lobbyist’s best friend.That’s what his former chief of staff said during Parson’s race for lieutenant governor.Bubs Hohulin was a former state representative who had fallen out of favor with Parson. In 2016 he went to Facebook to criticize his former boss.“I witnessed him agreeing to propose legislation on behalf of lobbyists who had contributed to his campaign without having any idea what the legislation actually did,” Hohulin wrote.Parson was the first, and most notable, politician to participate in the “Tilley Shuffle.” Steve Tilley, a former speaker of the House, left his position to become a lobbyist and political consultant, but he kept active his campaign account with hundreds of thousands of dollars. He donated thousands of dollars to Parson, who then returned the favor by hiring Tilley and paying him thousands of dollars right back. Parson’s connection to Tilley might have cost him a leadership spot while in the Senate.When Eric Greitens ran for office, Tilley and his ilk were a target.Parson embraces them.That’s not all bad. Greitens’ criticisms were exposed as a fraud, as he raised millions of dollars in secretive accounts to hide his donors. Parson does his work, for the most part at least, in the open.In January, he was inducted into the Missouri Farmers Care Hall of Fame, alongside Indiana oilman and billionaire Forrest Lucas, who also runs cattle in southwest Missouri. Lucas is one of Parson’s biggest donors, giving him more than $150,000 in the last election cycle. As a senator, Parson did his bidding more than once, pushing a constitutional amendment Lucas favored to protect farming rights and passing a bill that limits liability for ranchers when their cattle get loose.
In 2013, Parson threatened the Supreme Court at a Senate budget hearing, if it didn’t start collecting a $3 surcharge in municipal courts that funds sheriff retirements in the state. The court had determined the surcharge was unconstitutional.“That is going to be an issue to me and a burden to me if we don’t change what we’re doing on that,” Parson said during a hearing. Not long after that, the court, with little explanation, ordered municipal courts to collect the fee.After nearly two decades in politics, the 62-year-old farmer has a record, for better or for worse.Therein lies a lesson for Missouri voters.
2016 was the year of the outsider.There was Josh Hawley, the brash, young law professor who had barely seen the inside of a courtroom who defeated experienced attorneys and politicians during a campaign in which he ran as a “conservative outsider.” Hawley said that unlike the career politicians he faced he wouldn’t be a political ladder-climber. Less than one year into office he was preparing for his current race for the U.S. Senate.And there was Greitens, the former Navy SEAL, who ran as the ultimate outsider, blasting the Missouri Legislature as a bunch of corrupt insider politicians. He won, struggled to figure out how to do the job, was exposed as a hypocrite, and amid multiple criminal investigations and a potential House impeachment, resigned on Tuesday. He will be replaced by the consummate insider.Parson is well-liked in the Missouri Capitol. Unlike Greitens, he’s better at making friends than enemies.“Mike is a man of honesty and integrity. He’s a leader and his own man,” says former state Rep. Rick Stream, a Republican from Kirkwood who served with Parson in the Legislature. Both are veterans. Stream did his service in the Navy, Parson in the Army.Last year, as Stream was advocating for families with retired veterans at the troubled state-run St. Louis Veterans Home, he found Parson and his staff to be much more helpful than the governor.“When he heard that I was involved, he had his staff call me and visit the home,” Stream says. “He then had his staff begin their own investigation by interviewing patients, family members and workers. Their conclusion mirrored what our group had been saying all along.”Eventually, at Parson’s urging, the governor replaced members of the Missouri Veterans Commission, and changes were made to top administration at the home.In more than a handful of elections now, voters in Polk County and Missouri have had an opportunity to see various sides of Parson. He’s been vetted, and in the wake of the Greitens resignation, that’s not a bad thing.Says Stream: “I think Mike will be a very good governor.”

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Office of lieutenant governor deserves some respect,"May 31, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/columnists/office-of-lieutenant-governor-deserves-some-respect/article_958679f8-26b0-5458-9796-b488e5fa26df.html,"At 5 p.m. Friday, the office of lieutenant governor will become vacant when Lt. Gov. Mike Parson becomes governor. In response, the constitution and laws of Missouri, in effect, say: So what?The lieutenant governor’s office has taken on great importance in recent years. In the past 20 years, lieutenant governors have twice become governor: in 2000 with the death of Gov. Mel Carnahan, and this year with the resignation of Greitens.But the state’s constitution and laws make no provision for replacing a lieutenant governor. Even its nickname — “light gov” — signifies an office that can’t get respect. Tom Eagleton, who was elected to the post in 1964 and served until he was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1968, once told me that his main duty as lieutenant governor was to call the governor’s mansion in the morning and inquire whether the governor was still alive.

The office was considered a part-time position until Republican Bill Phelps ran and won in 1972 on the platform that he would serve as a full-time lieutenant governor. His nickname — “full-time” Phelps — stuck, and candidates since then have been well advised to promise full-time service.In recent years the Legislature has passed laws filling out the job description with about 11 duties, in addition to the constitutional duties to preside over the Senate, cast tie-breaking votes in the Senate and serve as governor if the governor becomes disabled or leaves the state.The Missouri Constitution says: “The governor shall fill all vacancies in public offices unless otherwise provided by law, and his appointees shall serve until their successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified.” “Provided by law” means that the legislature has enacted a law.There is no law, however, authorizing the governor to appoint, or the voters to elect, a person to serve as lieutenant governor to fill a vacancy in the office. To the contrary, the applicable statute says: “Whenever any vacancy, caused in any manner or by any means whatsoever, occurs or exists in any state or county office originally filled by election of the people, other than in the offices of lieutenant governor, state senator or representative, or sheriff, the vacancy shall be filled by appointment by the governor …”
By contrast, there are laws providing for the appointment of persons to fill vacancies in the offices of secretary of state, state auditor, treasurer and attorney general. A bill passed in 2013 provided for election of a lieutenant governor, but the governor vetoed it. A 2018 bill to provide for appointment of a lieutenant governor passed the Senate, but died in the House.
There have been 47 lieutenant governors since Missouri became a state in 1821. In at least 11 cases, there were deaths or resignations — and the office remained vacant, sometimes for years. The office was vacant in October 2000 when Roger Wilson became governor after Gov. Mel Carnahan’s death. Gov. Wilson appointed Joe Maxwell to fill the vacancy in November after Maxwell won election to the office but before he was inaugurated. No one objected. When Lt. Gov. Tom Eagleton resigned after the 1968 election to be sworn in as a U.S. Senator, William Morris, who had won election to the office, was sworn in to fill the vacancy. But the 1968 Senate leader objected because there was no authority for the appointment. These were appointments of a few days or weeks, and no precedent was established.Article 4, sec. 11(a) of the Missouri Constitution provides for an order of succession when there is a vacancy in the office of governor. If there is no lieutenant governor, the order of succession skips to the president pro tempore of the senate, the speaker of the house, the secretary of state, the state auditor, the state treasurer and the attorney general, respectively.The meaning of this provision seems to be that it is not essential to have a lieutenant governor. The governor, in whom the constitution vests the state’s executive power, presumably can assign the lieutenant governor’s executive duties to others in the executive branch. As for the lieutenant governor’s legislative role as presiding officer of the senate, the senate can, and often does, function without the lieutenant governor as its presiding officer, although there would be no tie-breaking vote.But given that a lieutenant governor on occasion becomes governor, should the law provide for the people to elect a successor?Michael A. Wolff, a retired judge of the Missouri Supreme Court who served a two-year term as chief justice, is professor emeritus and former dean of St. Louis University Law School."
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,On the new Missouri governor's to-do list: revive the state school board,"May 31, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/education/on-the-new-missouri-governor-s-to-do-list-revive/article_dc47c5e4-683d-5134-8e4e-aa2c1bdf658b.html,"The resignation of Gov. Eric Greitens may help put the state school board back in business after a nearly half-year hiatus that was forced by the governor’s actions.The Missouri Board of Education has had to cancel five of its 11 meetings scheduled for this year because it lacks a quorum. It has just three of eight members because of Greitens’ maneuvers with five school board appointees, whom he appointed in order to fire former state schools commissioner Margie Vandeven. That move angered education leaders and legislators alike.State education leaders are now looking to Lt. Gov. Mike Parson to restore the board to full membership. Parson will become governor at 5 p.m. Friday.

Parson would need to appoint at least two people for the board to have a quorum and hold its next meeting, which is set for June 12. Because state education officials were not expecting the board to regain a quorum in time, they are tentatively planning to reschedule the meeting for June 26, said interim Missouri Education Commissioner Roger Dorson.State law requires the board to meet by the end of June, but Dorson said he doesn’t know what kind of consequences the board would face if it doesn’t.Technically, Greitens could still appoint board members before he leaves office. But Senate Majority Floor Leader Mike Kehoe, R-Jefferson City, said it would be in bad taste if Greitens used his final hours in office to stack boards and commissions with his people.“I wouldn’t think it would be appropriate for him to do that,” Kehoe said. “I do not anticipate him making any of those appointments.”Parson also will likely wait to make appointments, at least until the special session adjourns. Anyone he appoints while the Legislature is in session would have to be confirmed by the Senate before the session ends, or would become ineligible to serve.The special session must end by June 17, but could end sooner.If Parson waits, his appointees would be able to act as full board members without confirmation until the next session convenes. Parson could not be reached for comment.After Greitens appointed five members last year, the board voted in December to remove Vandeven. In January, Greitens withdrew the names of his nominees and then reappointed them, in an effort to preserve their eligibility.The Senate voted April 24 to reject one Greitens appointee, Eddy Justice of Poplar Bluff. The Senate did not take action on the other four appointees, who all withdrew themselves from consideration before the end of the regular legislative session, said Lauren Hieger, spokeswoman for the Senate Majority Caucus.Hieger said Senate leaders do not know whether those four are now banned for life from serving on the board. There is no precedent for such a scenario, so the issue would have to be decided by the courts, she said.Learning curveEven after Parson appoints new state school board members, they will face a huge learning curve and shouldn’t be rushed into the job, says board member Mike Jones. Vic Lenz of St. Louis County, Charlie Shields of St. Joseph and Jones of St. Louis are the three current board members.“Bottom line, even if Vic and Charlie and I could literally pick up where we left off, you’ve still got new board members who still have to literally be put back up to speed,” said Jones.The board was designed to avoid such dramatic turnover. The eight members serve staggered eight-year terms, with one member’s term expiring each year. The intent was to replace board members slowly.“Your most inexperienced members got a chance to learn the system without really risking anything,” Jones said. “You were able to get stability while at the same time not getting static because you were always getting new people on there. But they didn’t come in numbers that were disruptive.”Greitens was able to stack the board with five people at once after former Gov. Jay Nixon let four terms expire without replacements.Moreover, Parson will be able to appoint a sixth member as soon as July 1. Jones’ term will expire at the end of June.
Unfinished businessThe board has a long to-do list to tackle when it meets again. Arguably of most importance is the hiring of a state schools commissioner.Ten people applied for the position in January. Lenz said he thinks the board needs to redo the application process and conduct a wider and longer search.“The application process we used at that time was rushed by the same five people who voted to remove the commissioner,” Lenz said. “I think we need to start all over.”Other action items include:• Deciding whether to renew six charter schools, including Lafayette Preparatory Academy, Lift for Life Academy and Eagle College Prep, all in St. Louis.
• Deciding whether an elected school board should regain control of St. Louis Public Schools from the appointed Special Administrative Board.• Voting on disciplinary action for at least two dozen teacher licenses.• Hammering out details of a makeover of Missouri’s school accountability system.Dorson said that if the board doesn’t meet in June, the education department might approve the charter school renewals, pending final board approval, so as not to disrupt students’ schooling.Greitens’ legacyIn the eyes of education leaders, Greitens is leaving no legacy at best and a negative one at worst.“I think we ought to be grateful, and I said it before, that he was leaving,” Jones said. “We ought to be grateful for his political incompetence. He could have done a lot more damage.”Greitens will undoubtedly be remembered for his successful but highly unpopular mission to oust Vandeven.Other than that, Greitens leaves no significant education policy accomplishments. He signed a bill to create four adult high schools and approved budget increases to fully fund the school aid formula last year. But he championed no major education initiatives, did not communicate with education leaders and never visited a school in the St. Louis area as governor.“What he did work on was certainly stuff that we didn’t find as positive for public education in Missouri,” said Melissa Randol, executive director of the Missouri School Boards’ Association. “He wasn’t as engaged on a number of education issues and so it’s really hard to evaluate him beyond his actions with the state board.”Parker Briden, Greitens’ spokesman, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Randol said she has higher hopes for Parson, who seems to enjoy a better reputation among education leaders.“He has been someone who supports public education,” Randol said. “We are looking forward to working with him.”"
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"With Greitens gone, the spin cycle now turns back to Missouri's nationally watched Senate race","May 31, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/with-greitens-gone-the-spin-cycle-now-turns-back-to/article_e5ba0205-cb4f-5f85-97ae-710669052830.html,"WASHINGTON • A Washington-based Democratic political action committee began running ads in Missouri just before Memorial Day that try to link a Republican candidate for U.S. Senate — state Attorney General Josh Hawley — with troubled Gov. Eric Greitens.Greitens’ sudden resignation announcement Tuesday hasn’t prompted the PAC to pull the ads. Democrats argue that the governor’s decision doesn’t wipe away their claim that Hawley is part of a corrupt and distant Republican leadership in Jefferson City.Republicans believe that any guilt-by-association attacks will go away with Greitens, whose resignation is effective Friday. They assert that Hawley, the leading contender to face U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill in November, will now be able to more aggressively shift his efforts to the Democratic incumbent and her voting record in the Senate behind a more unified Republican Party.

Regardless of either side’s spin, the post-Greitens landscape will re-focus on the Senate race as the pre-eminent political story in Missouri.

Since January, Greitens’ survival has dominated headlines and framed most political talk in the state, even though McCaskill, Hawley and outside groups have begun a campaign in which tens — even hundreds — of millions of dollars likely will be spent between now and Nov. 6.“I don’t think the governor staying in office spelled doom for Hawley, but it didn’t help either,” said Andy Blunt, who ran his father, Roy Blunt’s, successful 2016 Senate race in the state. “November is a long way off politically, and now there is plenty of time for the party to come together and for Eric Greitens to be a thing of the past. Everyone is in the same boat now and rowing in the same direction.”But Chris Hayden, a top consultant to Roy Blunt’s 2016 opponent, then-Missouri Secretary of State Jason Kander, said Greitens’ resignation made Hawley the leading face of a Republican Party that has been rocked by corruption. He said Democrats would continue to argue that Hawley did not act in his official capacity to legally investigate Greitens until it became politically safe to do so.“Jeff City is just as corrupt — it is really worse because now you have had a governor resign because of how he has acted,” Hayden, communications director for the Senate Majority PAC, which is running the ads attacking Hawley and Greitens. “Josh Hawley is caught in the middle of this. There is a cloud over him, and that cloud is corruption in Jefferson City.”Dave Robertson, head of the Department of Political Science at the University of Missouri-St.-Louis, said that “Greitens supporters will not view Hawley as the second coming of Greitens, but Democratic ads against Hawley will portray him as the second coming of Greitens to everyone else.“So to the extent that Greitens matters in November, he doesn’t do much to energize Hawley’s base, but does a lot to mobilize McCaskill’s base,” Robertson said in a tweeted response to Post-Dispatch questions. “That’s depending on how much Greitens matters at all – an open question.”Republicans say they hope Democrats continue to attack Hawley through Greitens because it indicates they have nothing else on the first-term Republican attorney general, who is favored by the state’s GOP establishment. Hawley faces a multiple-candidate August primary field that includes ex-libertarian Austin Petersen and ex-Air Force pilot Tony Monetti, who have raised the most money among a field of lesser-known candidates.
“This focuses the race back on Claire McCaskill,” said Bob Salera, a spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee, which is expected to weigh in with its own heavy advertising campaign to support Hawley. “Her allies have been desperate to change the subject to anything. They tried to latch onto the Greitens thing to replicate the luck they had in 2012 with Todd Akin.”That was a reference to McCaskill’s 2012 Republican opponent, whose comments on rape overturned a race in which polls showed Akin had a good chance of unseating the state’s senior senator.The incumbent McCaskill was uncharacteristically quiet in her reaction to Greitens’ resignation, saying only that she was looking forward to working with Lt. Gov. Mike Parson, who will replace Greitens on Friday.But other state Democrats, arguing that Hawley did not begin his own investigation of Greitens’ campaign committees until months after acknowledging wrongdoing, said Hawley’s own lack of commitment to the job — and his ambition to move up — would remain an attack line long after Greitens is gone.
“Hawley is still a typical politician and a weak candidate, with a record of failing in the job he currently holds,” former state Democratic Chairman Roy Temple said. “I’m not sure renewed scrutiny of his candidacy will prove helpful over the long term.”Though Republican legislative leaders in Jefferson City were among Greitens’ harshest critics, state Democrats were stressing on Wednesday policy issues on which Greitens and Republican leaders generally agreed, in an apparent effort to keep Greitens on the board as an overall campaign issue.In a statement Tuesday after Greitens’ announcement, Missouri Democratic Party Chairman Stephen Webber said legislative Republicans “were wrong to follow Greitens’ lead” on issues such as the minimum wage and health care.But Missouri Republican political operative Gregg Keller said that “Claire McCaskill was a real and substantive loser” with Greitens’ resignation.Keller, a strong Greitens critic, recently warned fellow Republicans that Greitens’ ongoing drama was “making it more difficult for us to maintain control of the U.S. Senate.” But now that Greitens is leaving, Keller predicted Wednesday, attempts by the Democrats to continue using him against Hawley will backfire.“I think that’s a tactical mistake by the Democrats. They can talk all they want about this former elected official who is no longer on the scene, but I expect Josh to go out there and talk about tax reform” and the strong economy, he said.For his part, Hawley received on Wednesday a key endorsement in Springfield from Missouri Right to Life, an anti-abortion group.Kevin McDermott of the Post-Dispatch contributed to this story from St. Louis.

Eric Greitens, legislative leaders turned their attention Wednesday to helping guide Lt. Gov. Mike Parson’s transition into the top spot in Missouri government.A day after the scandal-plagued Greitens announced he would resign effective 5 p.m. Friday, Parson spent Wednesday in meetings and phone calls discussing his imminent elevation to governor, spokeswoman Kelli Jones said.Jones said Parson would be sworn in as Missouri’s 57th governor immediately after 5 p.m. Friday. A judge has not been chosen for the ceremony, she added.

Parson did not take questions from the reporters gathered outside his second-floor office. But in a statement released Wednesday afternoon, Parson said:“We are taking every step and working around the clock to ensure Missouri state government does not miss a beat throughout this transition. My commitment to all Missourians is to listen to them and work together to advance the interests of our great state.”Among those meeting with Parson were House Speaker Todd Richardson, R-Poplar Bluff; Senate President Pro Tem Ron Richard, R-Joplin; and Senate Majority Floor Leader Mike Kehoe, R-Jefferson City.Richardson said Parson, a 62-year-old former sheriff and state lawmaker from Bolivar, was invited to address a joint session of the House and Senate on June 11.“We’re pleased that there is an open line of communication,” Richardson said.Richard said the legislative leaders were sharing staff with Parson to help him navigate the transition.“It’s not a happy time. It’s a time where we just need to move on,” Richard said. “We’re going to try and help make that as easy as we can.”In addition to meeting with the leaders, Parson reached out to all cabinet members. Parson plans to hold a meeting with the cabinet early next week.On Thursday, Parson will receive a briefing from the Missouri Department of Public Safety’s State Emergency Management Agency and finalize the details of the swearing-in ceremony.Amid the talk of the transition from Greitens to Parson were discussions of whether to continue pursuing an investigation by the House into Greitens’ 2015 extramarital affair and his use of a fundraising list from his former charity, The Mission Continues.Greitens’ spokesman, Parker Briden, said the governor was working in the Capitol on Wednesday and would move out of the governor’s mansion by Friday.Greitens, 44, had been scheduled to testify Monday before a special House committee that was charged with recommending whether to impeach the governor. A Cole County judge also had ruled that his legal staff had to release fundraising information from a dark money nonprofit used to promote Greitens’ agenda.Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley also is investigating Greitens for his fundraising practices.“Our office intends to pursue and conclude its investigations in an orderly fashion,” Hawley spokeswoman Mary Compton said.With the governor’s 16-month tenure nearly finished, the woman who accused Greitens of taking a picture of her while she was nude or semi-nude issued a statement through her attorney.“My client and I are thankful to all of the individuals involved that honored my client’s privacy by not publishing her name and other identifying information. Our gratitude goes out to the media, the House committee, the St. Louis circuit attorney and the special prosecutor among others. Now that the Governor has resigned, I hope my client can go back to being a private citizen and put this matter behind her,” attorney Scott Simpson of St. Charles wrote.In a memo issued Tuesday to members of the House Republican caucus, GOP leaders said the special session scheduled to determine impeachment would be shut down.
“The decision of Gov. Greitens to step down means we will no longer need to proceed with the special session, and the investigative committee will wrap up its work in short order,” the memo notes. “We know there are still many other questions to be answered, and we will devote as much time as necessary to ensure you are fully aware of where we are, and what happens next.”Richardson told reporters he was unsure about the status of the subpoenas ordering Greitens’ attorneys to release documents. “I don’t have an answer for you,” Richardson said.He added there were no negotiations between House leaders and the governor’s office to close down the House investigation in exchange for Greitens’ resignation.Although Richard was among the voices calling for Greitens to step down when word of his extramarital affair surfaced in January, Richard said he was focused on getting state government back on track.“There is no happy time on a resignation,” Richard said.Among those shuttling in and out of the lieutenant governor’s office was former state Treasurer Sarah Steelman, who was Greitens’ pick to serve as commissioner of the Office of Administration.Steelman would not comment on whether she was planning to stay on board after Greitens leaves to help with the transition. “I just don’t feel like it’s appropriate,” Steelman told the Post-Dispatch.
After their meeting with Parson, Richard and Richardson put their signatures on legislation approved by lawmakers during the spring session. More than 140 bills now go to the governor’s office for his consideration.Greitens will have two days to take action on the legislation before he leaves office.Richardson said he was not concerned about any last-minute vetoes being issued by the outgoing governor.“I have not had a direct conversation, but I am not worried about it,” Richardson said.Jack Suntrup of the Post-Dispatch contributed to this report.• Embattled Missouri Gov.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Governor's attorneys approached St. Louis prosecutor with deal: He'll resign, you drop felony charge","May 31, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/governor-s-attorneys-approached-st-louis-prosecutor-with-deal-he/article_0dc2964a-9f07-5d50-a3b4-c5ffd71bd6c6.html,"ST. LOUIS • Attorneys for Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens contacted St. Louis prosecutors on Saturday, proposing that he would resign from office if Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner would drop a felony charge against him.














        
            Embattled Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens resigns; 'resolution' reached in St. Louis

“The last few months have been incredibly difficult for me, for my family, for my team, for my friends, and many, many people that I love,” he…




Both moves came to fruition this week, with the governor’s abrupt announcement Tuesday that he’d leave office by the end of the week, and Gardner’s agreeing to drop the computer tampering charge he faced in St. Louis.

Gardner, a Democrat, announced the dismissal Wednesday in a news conference at the Carnahan Courthouse in St. Louis. Her office had charged Greitens, a Republican, on April 20 with illegally using a donor list from Greitens’ former charity for political fundraising toward his 2016 campaign for governor. Greitens, a former Navy SEAL, founded the nonprofit, The Mission Continues, in 2007.

     })(document,""_nw2e-js"",""script"",""http://launch.newsinc.com/js/embed.js"")





            Read Kim Gardner's statement about dropping the charge against Greitens“It is time for us to move on,” Gardner said, adding later: “I remain confident that we have the evidence required to pursue charges against Mr. Greitens. But sometimes, pursuing charges is not the right or just thing to do for our city or state.”In dismissing the case, Gardner noted that first-time offenders, particularly in nonviolent cases, rarely serve prison time. Gardner would not answer questions from reporters Wednesday.














        
            Who is Mike Parson? Meet Missouri's lieutenant governor, who steps up to replace Greitens

Mike Parson, 62, a veteran and former rural county sheriff began his career at the Capitol in 2005. 




After her news conference, her spokeswoman Susan Ryan said Greitens’ defense attorneys approached prosecutors on Saturday about an agreement and initiated the idea that he would resign if Gardner dropped the charge.Circuit Judge Rex Burlison accepted on Wednesday a stipulation for dismissal from both sides. Afterward, defense attorney Jim Martin said Greitens’ decision to resign was a personal one and did not stem from fear of being prosecuted for computer tampering.Once Greitens leaves office, the case will be dismissed officially — with prejudice — which means it cannot be refiled. Martin declined to comment on the substance of the agreement.



            Redacted agreement between Greitens and Gardner's officeBurlison released copies of the agreement Wednesday. Two paragraphs of the agreement are redacted, and neither side would comment on the contents of those sections. Ryan said defense attorneys requested the sealing. Martin said that although defense attorneys agreed to making the sections secret, the idea had come from prosecutors.The remainder of the agreement releases Gardner “and all members of her office and consultants of her office from any civil liability on account of matters alleged” in both the invasion of privacy and computer tampering cases. The agreement also “waives any claim to court costs not already taxed in either cause.”Ryan would not comment on whether Greitens admitted any wrongdoing or made any apology. An attorney for the woman who accused Greitens of taking a picture of her while she was nude or semi-nude said she had received no apology from Greitens.Ryan said there was no coordination with Jackson County Prosecutor Jean Peters Baker, who was named a special prosecutor in an invasion of privacy investigation against Greitens. Gardner dropped the charge three days into jury selection when faced with having to answer questions under oath about her former lead investigator, William Don Tisaby.There was also no discussion with a Missouri House committee investigating Greitens, Gardner’s spokeswoman said.Ryan said the agreement did not benefit Gardner in any way; she said there was no deal about potential sanctions against her or a police investigation into perjury allegations by Gardner’s investigator or claims of misconduct by Gardner herself. Defense attorneys have accused Gardner of improperly withholding evidence and suborning sworn testimony from her lead investigator.Professor Brendan Roediger, a St. Louis University law professor, raised ethical concerns on Twitter about the portion of the agreement that releases Gardner, her office and consultants from civil liability. Roediger cited a state statute that says a “public servant commits the offense of acceding to corruption if he or she knowingly solicits, accepts or agrees to accept any benefit, direct or indirect,” for an official action.Gardner’s office also responded on Twitter, saying that the agreement was “perfectly legal,” that Burlison had signed off on it and that it protected “the taxpayers from having to defend frivolous lawsuits.”Roediger told the Post-Dispatch that if Gardner were sued, it would be in her individual capacity because she has some immunity as St. Louis’ elected prosecutor. Greitens had something of value in a potential lawsuit, he said.“The moment, as a prosecutor, that you start to consider your personal liability, your ethical obligation is to ask … for a new prosecutor and recuse yourself,” Roediger said.He called Gardner’s office’s claim that the judge had signed off on the deal “laughable,” saying “the judge is not somehow validating the conduct of the parties.”















        
            Trouble lurked between the lines of Greitens' perfect story

In hindsight, though, Greitens’ spectacular flame-out over the past five months, ending with his edge-of-tears announcement Tuesday that he is…




Cristian Stevens, a former federal prosecutor now in private practice, said plea deals with public officials or employees in federal court typically required the official to step down. The loss of that job serves as punishment, he said, and it can deter other officials from similar conduct. It also prevents that person from further misconduct, both by removing them them from office and — in deals that involve a guilty plea — giving them a felony conviction that can prevent them from serving in some future positions.Stevens said every case was different, but what is not typical in federal court is the dismissal of a case without some guilty plea and admission of guilt.‘No witch hunt’While Gardner said Wednesday that dismissal of the computer tampering charge was the best course of action, she criticized Greitens’ statements that he had done no wrong and had been the victim of a witch hunt.





        
            Messenger: Greitens goes out the way he came in, haunted by the specter of dark money

Not quite 17 months into his term, Greitens is going out the way he came in, haunted by the specter of dark money. 




“Contrary to Mr. Greitens’ past statements, there was no witch hunt, no plans to bring pain to him or his family,” Gardner said. “Quite the contrary, the consequences Mr. Greitens has suffered he brought upon himself by his actions, his statements, his decisions, his ambition and pursuit for power.” Gardner said there “was no coordinated effort by anyone to target him based upon his politics. Rather, it was his actions.”The Greitens cases “did not cost taxpayers anymore than our existing budget allocation. And these cases were not pursued at the expense of my office’s priorities,” she said. Her chief trial assistant Robert Dierker said Wednesday that he didn’t know how much the office had spent prosecuting Greitens but that it was probably “somewhere between a normal felony case and a capital (murder) case.”
Greitens’ attorneys had asked a judge to disqualify Gardner from the computer tampering case, accusing her of running a politically motivated investigation against the governor.














        
            With status of Greitens' probe in limbo, transition of new Missouri governor begins



The defense argued that Tisaby, the private investigator hired by Gardner in the invasion of privacy case, had committed perjury, tainting her office’s ability to prosecute the newer felony charge against the governor. The defense also accused Gardner of repeated failures to turn over evidence as required, resulting in sanctions by Burlison last week allowing the defense to re-interview some witnesses, including Tisaby.Baker, the Jackson County prosecutor, said her investigation continued into allegations that Greitens took in March 2015 a semi-nude photograph of a woman without her consent. The woman has accused him of threatening to release the photo if she spoke about the affair. Greitens has denied claims he blackmailed her.Gardner said Baker had sole authority over the invasion of privacy case now.Greitens’ surprise announcement Tuesday came hours after a ruling by a Cole County judge that would force the governor’s campaign and a dark-money political group affiliated with Greitens to reveal fundraising information to a special House investigative committee.More• Embattled Missouri Gov.

Eric Greitens.

After the Cole County Circuit Court judge had ordered the soon-to-be former governor’s campaign and dark-money committee to produce documents sought by the Missouri House committee investigating Greitens’ various misdeeds.After the Missouri political world was turned upside down.On Tuesday, many in the Capitol were pointing to Beetem’s ruling as the whiff of air that collapsed Greitens’ house of cards.“Time is of the essence,” Beetem wrote in ordering that documents for both the Greitens for Missouri campaign and A New Missouri nonprofit be produced by June 1. Those documents could well have showed further ethics violations. They could have unmasked private donors. They most certainly would have helped the House make its case for impeachment.Instead, Greitens walked away.Beetem, meanwhile, walked right back into the fray, about 8:35 in the morning, pulling out his credit card to order pizza for a lunch later that day with family law attorneys. They were having a meeting to talk about ways to improve the dispensation of justice in cases that are generally fraught with emotion, the sort of cases that occupy much more of Beetem’s time than those that garner political headlines.“The intersection of the law and family is never pretty,” Beetem said.Before lunch, though, Beetem was pulled right back into the Greitens saga, asked to make a ruling on the case that started it all.Before the governor was charged with two felonies, before he admitted an affair and the House found evidence of behavior that was nonconsensual, before all the impeachment talk, there was a simple Sunshine Law complaint.It was filed by Clayton attorney Mark Pedroli in December, on behalf of fellow attorney Ben Sansone and The Sunshine Project. It alleges that Greitens and his staffers violated open records law by using a phone app that destroys text messages before a government official can determine whether they need to be retained.
On Wednesday, as St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner was dropping a felony charge of computer tampering against the governor, Pedroli pressed his case.“We want to go forward,” Pedroli said in a telephone conference call on the case. Beetem let two reporters into his chambers to listen to the call. “There is no reason to delay,” Pedroli said.Except for one.As of Friday night or first thing Saturday morning, Bob Thompson, the Bryan Cave attorney representing the governor’s office in the case, will have a new client. Lt. Gov. Mike Parson will be sworn in as governor, and Thompson might receive new marching orders.That shouldn’t stop the fact-finding that is part of the discovery process, Pedroli argued, appealing to a judge who just the day before had run out of patience with delay tactics.
“It’s been my theory all along that Confide was used to do public business,” Pedroli said. He referenced the Greitens’ campaign and A New Missouri. Like the House investigators, he wants to see documents from those organizations that could help him prove his case.In the end, that case might be made or broken based on what is on the phones of the governor and his staff members. To that end, he asked Beetem Wednesday to take steps to preserve those phones.Thompson protested. That has been the governor’s position pretty much anytime he is asked a question, from reporters, lawmakers or attorneys.“They have refused to answer anything and everything, particularly about the phones,” Pedroli said.Beetem drew a line in the sand.He asked Pedroli to draft orders requiring the governor’s office to confirm the names and phone numbers of everybody in his office who used Confide, and another order requiring a forensic expert or “special master” to take mirror images of those phones to preserve any evidence.Pedroli said he would have them drafted within hours.It was the day after, and time was of the essence.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Tweet thanking Eric Greitens for his service 'missed the mark,' Mayor Krewson admits","May 30, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/tweet-thanking-eric-greitens-for-his-service-missed-the-mark/article_8eff070b-f818-5a44-8b9f-c080597dab48.html,"ST. LOUIS • Embattled Gov. Eric Greitens' surprise decision to resign the office he's held for less than two years prompted swift reaction from officials throughout Missouri on Tuesday night. But one response from St. Louis Mayor Lyda Krewson, in her own words, ""missed the mark.""I thank the governor for his service. I know this was a hard decision. My hope is that we get back to working for the people and doing the business of the state.— Mayor Lyda Krewson (@LydaKrewson) May 29, 2018

A tweet Krewson sent shortly after the governor's announcement thanking him for his service sparked backlash from St. Louisans and other Democratic officials who called her statement tone-deaf and unnecessarily tepid, citing the many scandals surrounding Greitens, including accusations of sexual and physical assault.

With all due respect, why are you thanking him? This is a governor who is under investigation for sexual assualt and blackmail, and who has never missed a chance to insult and trample on the City of St. Louis since his term began.— Jonah Klein-Barton (@Klein_Barton) May 29, 2018

It was a St. Louis hairdresser with whom Greitens admitted to having a consensual affair in January. But her testimony both in court and before an investigative committee in the Missouri Legislature told a different story about a far more disturbing relationship. Among her statements – deemed credible by the GOP-led committee of legislators – was an allegation that before running for office as a squeaky clean family man, Greitens took a nude picture of the woman without her consent and blackmailed her with it, before coercing her to perform oral sex.That accusation was at the center of a now scuttled felony invasion of privacy case, though a special prosecutor continues to investigate the matter. Greitens also faced a second St. Louis charge for felony data-tampering, involving his alleged use of a charity donor list for political fundraising, that was dropped on Wednesday.Taking away our hard fought min wage, signing SB 43, vetoing HCB 3, trying to dismantle historic and all tax credits. I haven’t even got to the new shit! Smh https://t.co/NrcHMhgcbP— Bruce Franks Jr (@brucefranksjr) May 29, 2018

Krewson's critics pointed to both charges, as well as Greitens' policy record as as conservative governor and his often inflammatory rhetoric about St. Louis, which he has deemed ""the most dangerous city in the United States of America"" and an ""abortion sanctuary city.""Many questioned why she would praise the service of someone who took action to reverse the city's long-sought minimum wage increase for St. Louis workers, something Krewson supported.
I look forward to working with Governor @mikeparson for the betterment of our city and state— Mayor Lyda Krewson (@LydaKrewson) May 29, 2018

Roughly two hours after sending her first tweet, the mayor tried again, saying she looked forward to working with incoming Gov. Mike Parson.It wasn't until the wee hours of Wednesday morning that the mayor offered a condemnation of Missouri's scandalized chief executive on both Facebook and Twitter. Her initial comment was well-intended to ""begin the healing needed from the inexcusable, embarrassing and disgusting actions of Governor Eric Greitens,"" she said, but admitted she probably ""should have left civility at the door.""
It is said that the road to hell is paved with good intention. Yesterday, I posted a tweet intended to begin the healing needed from inexcusable, embarrassing, and disgusting actions of Governor Eric Greitens. It was well intended but missed the mark!  (1/4)— Mayor Lyda Krewson (@LydaKrewson) May 30, 2018

I probably should have left civility at the door and said, thank goodness Governor Greitens got the message that violating the trust of his family, his supporters, his staff and the voters is inexcusable.  I should have said, it’s about time and overdue. (2/4)— Mayor Lyda Krewson (@LydaKrewson) May 30, 2018

But I considered the victims—the woman whom he assaulted - is wife and children - his many supporters who believed in him - and the people of the State of Missouri, who rightly expected that their Governor would comport himself honorably. (3/4)— Mayor Lyda Krewson (@LydaKrewson) May 30, 2018

Let there be no doubt, I condemn Eric Greitens behavior.  I do not celebrate his downfall, but I am hopeful that we can begin  a new chapter with Governor Mike Parson. (4/4)— Mayor Lyda Krewson (@LydaKrewson) May 30, 2018

She also clarified that she had considered the victims involved in the unfolding scandals, including the woman who said Greitens hit and sexually assaulted her, as well as Greitens' wife and two children.""Let there be no doubt, I condemn Eric Greitens' behavior. I do not celebrate his downfall, but I am hopeful that we can begin a new chapter with Governor Mike Parson,"" she said.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Embattled Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens resigns; prosecutor drops computer tampering charge,"May 30, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/embattled-missouri-gov-eric-greitens-resigns-prosecutor-drops-computer-tampering/article_b3674fa9-5972-529e-b0a2-4c6ca010dc42.html,"UPDATED at 10:50 a.m. Wednesday to reflect Gardner's announcement:JEFFERSON CITY • Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens on Tuesday abruptly announced he is stepping down effective 5 p.m. Friday in the face of an impeachment effort, an adverse judicial ruling and criminal investigations.“The last few months have been incredibly difficult for me, for my family, for my team, for my friends, and many, many people that I love,” he said, saying he was the victim of “legal harassment.”

“I have not broken any laws or committed any offense worthy of this treatment,” he asserted.














        
            Post-Dispatch coverage of the Greitens affair scandal

From Greitens' initial statement to the legal battle, read the Post-Dispatch coverage of the governor's scandal. 




Greitens, a Republican, rocketed onto Missouri’s political scene in 2015, promising to take on “career politicians” and a culture of “corruption” in Jefferson City. A year after taking office, his own administration became engulfed in scandal when Greitens admitted to a 2015 extramarital affair but denied allegations he threatened his lover with a compromising photograph.Peripheral scandals swirled — his reliance on untraceable political donations, use of a self-destructing texting app and use of a charity donor list to raise campaign contributions all drawing negative attention.Despite revelation after revelation this winter and spring, Greitens resisted leaving his post — until his surprise announcement on Tuesday.














        
            St. Louis prosecutor drops computer tampering charge against Greitens



St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner, a Democrat who led a now-scuttled felony invasion-of-privacy case against the governor, announced Wednesday that her office had reached an agreement with Greitens’ attorneys to drop a separate felony data-tampering case  involving Greitens’ alleged use of a charity donor list for political fundraising.""It is time for us to move on,"" Gardner said, adding: ""Sometimes pursuing charges is not the right thing to do for our city or our state.""By contrast, Jackson County prosecutor Jean Peters Baker, who was named special prosecutor after the charge related to his extramarital affair was dropped this month, said her investigation continues.“In the interest of pursuing justice to its fullest lengths, we will continue until our work on the case is completed,” Baker said in a statement. “Specifically regarding any deals we made with Governor Greitens’ attorneys, no deals were made by my office. Our review of this case, as I have stated before, will be pursued without fear or favor.”Greitens’ surprise announcement came hours after a ruling by a Cole County judge that would force the governor’s campaign and a dark-money political group affiliated with Greitens to reveal fundraising information to a special House committee that was investigating the governor.Following the announcement, the committee canceled the remaining hearings on its schedule this week. The committee will “wrap up its work in short order,” according to a GOP House caucus email sent Tuesday afternoon.














        
            Missouri's next governor: Mike Parson



Greitens’ decision means that Lt. Gov. Mike Parson, also a Republican, will become governor.Parson, 62, was not in the Capitol when Greitens announced his plan. After he arrived Tuesday evening, Parson said he had been working on his farm when he heard of the pending resignation.Allegations surrounding the governor led to an unprecedented split in Greitens’ Republican Party, leaders of which led efforts to impeach him.














        
            St. Louis, state leaders react to governor's resignation



Rep. Jay Barnes, R-Jefferson City, who is leading the Missouri House investigation into Greitens, said after the announcement that he would not comment on Greitens’ resignation or whether the committee would continue its work.Attorney General Josh Hawley, who is investigating Greitens and had called on him to resign, said Greitens did the “right thing” by resigning. Hawley, a Republican, is running to unseat U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo.“Governor Greitens has done the right thing today,” Hawley said in a written statement. “I wish incoming Governor Mike Parson well, and stand ready to assist him in his transition. This Office’s work for the people of Missouri goes forward.”Senate President Pro Tem Ron Richard, R-Joplin, said the governor’s problems were trying for the state.“When the governor took office in January of 2017, I had very high hopes. I believed we were on the path to building a better Missouri. This is not the position I imagined we would be in nearly 16 months later. However, I do believe the governor made the right decision,” Richard said.House Speaker Todd Richardson, R-Poplar Bluff, had called for Greitens’ resignation and led the effort to call a special session to consider impeachment.“We believe the Governor has put the best interest of Missourians first today by choosing to resign,” Richardson said. “The past few months have been difficult for everyone involved, including the Governor and his family. This is a serious and solemn occasion that reminds us that our state and our duty are bigger than any one person or party.”Court rulingGreitens’ historic move came hours after a Cole County judge ruled the governor and his allies must comply with two subpoenas from the House panel that is seeking information about the nonprofit group A New Missouri and Greitens’ campaign fund — despite protests from Greitens’ legal team.Circuit Judge Jon E. Beetem said the House committee investigating Greitens was within its rights to ask for the documents.“The Court finds the requests are within the authority of the requestor,” Beetem wrote in his six-page decision. “The Court further finds and believes that time is of the essence and production should begin immediately and, absent good cause shown, said production should be completed by June 1, 2018.”Coincidentally or not, that is the day Greitens’ resignation takes effect.Greitens for Missouri and A New Missouri were ordered to turn over communications between the two groups and policies “concerning coordination or communication between Greitens for Missouri and A New Missouri, Inc.”A New Missouri was ordered to turn over receipts of paid media, content of paid media and communication regarding paid media. The nonprofit will also have to turn over communications between the group and Greitens and his campaign.It was unclear Tuesday afternoon if the campaign and dark-money group would still turn over information to the panel or protest further, arguing that because Greitens is resigning, the committee would lose jurisdiction.Greitens’ legal team had sought to quash the subpoenas. Catherine Hanaway, a Greitens attorney, said in a statement that she was pleased the judge is allowing A New Missouri to redact the names of donors to protect their identities.“We are considering our options for an appeal,” Hanaway said.
The House committee has said it believes the Greitens campaign and its associates may have actively worked to conceal the identity of donors, a campaign finance violation.A former Greitens campaign adviser, Michael Hafner, also told the committee Tuesday that the Greitens campaign discussed soliciting donations from foreign nationals, a violation of federal law.“There were conversations that we had where foreign money was discussed and the possibility of foreign money being contributed to an entity,” Hafner said.Hafner left the campaign soon after and said he was not aware if those discussions continued.Greitens’ legal team, led by Hanaway, argued last week that the special House committee’s request for documents was too sweeping and amounted to a “fishing expedition.” Hanaway said the campaign had already produced thousands of documents within a short time period. She also worried the identity of donors to A New Missouri — which has not revealed its donors — would be revealed if the House obtained its documents.“The requestor Committee has a mandate to investigate the allegations against Governor Greitens,” Beetem wrote. “While this is a broad mandate, so are the grounds for impeachment. The Court finds the requests are within the authority of the requestor.”














        
            Post-Dispatch coverage of the Greitens affair scandal

From Greitens' initial statement to the legal battle, read the Post-Dispatch coverage of the governor's scandal. 




Greitens himself had been subpoenaed to testify before the committee on June 4. It was not clear Tuesday evening if that or any other committee meeting would be held.In his testimony, Hafner outlined his role in the early stages of Greitens’ decision to run for governor, during which time the governor is alleged to have violated state ethics laws by spending money on his campaign without forming a campaign committee.In particular, Hafner said he was paid by one of Greitens’ businesses throughout the month of January before the campaign committee was formed.Hafner said he had advised Greitens to form a committee to avoid breaking the law.“Obviously he disregarded it,” Hafner said.Hafner, who later went to work for businessman John Brunner’s unsuccessful 2016 campaign for the GOP nomination for governor, has been called a “disgruntled” ex-staffer by Greitens’ attorneys.
On Tuesday, however, he denied it.“I didn’t seek this out. I am here in pursuit of the truth,” Hafner said. “I was perfectly content with leaving all of this in the past.”














        
            Post-Dispatch coverage of Greitens, campaign issues and The Mission Continues

Greitens, a former Navy Seal, founded The Mission Continues in 2007. His alleged use of a fundraising list from the charity is under investigation. 




The scene in the CapitolThe governor’s end came in a mad scramble that was, for some, emotional.A bit after 3 p.m. Tuesday, no one was stationed at the front desk of the governor’s reception room. A woman who walked through the office said Greitens’ press secretary was “in a meeting.”Around 3:15 p.m., a Post-Dispatch reporter stopped by Parson’s office to see if his press secretary, Kelli Jones, had heard anything about a possible resignation.“I have not heard anything,” she said.Over the next several minutes, Greitens’ staffers paced up and down the second floor hallway entering and exiting their office suite. Parker Briden, the governor’s press secretary, was asked if a resignation was imminent. He said he would have “a statement a little bit later today. About to send an email.”Two other Greitens officials, Drew Erdmann and Will Scharf, declined to respond to reporter questions as they walked down the hallway.Capitol maintenance workers hauled a podium up a spiraled Rotunda stairwell and to Greitens’ office.A line of reporters and other Capitol staffers began to gather outside Greitens’ office.Greitens’ chief legal counsel, Lucinda Luetkemeyer, wept during and after the governor’s announcement.Afterwards, Erdmann, who was brought in to serve as the chief operating officer for the administration, was asked what’s next. He could only shrug.Robert Patrick of the Post-Dispatch contributed to this report.More• City prosecuting attorney drops computer tampering charge• Trouble lurked between the lines of Greitens' perfect story• Meet Missouri's next governor: Mike Parson• Messenger: Greitens goes out the way he came in, haunted by specter of dark money• Sultan: It should have been enough• Greitens said it: Memorable quotes that marked his candidacy, governorship• Political leaders react to the resignation

A man with a shred of decency would have resigned then. Instead, he refused bipartisan calls to resign, and his legal team interrogated his accuser about orgasms, her nipple piercing and oral sex technique.This was a vile, embarrassing spectacle for every Missouri resident. Imagine how painful it must have been for the woman involved.Greitens announced his resignation after a judge said he must hand over documents that would have shed light on his dark money contributions. In this moment of reckoning for men who abuse their power to mistreat women, the horrifying testimony of a woman who suffered coercion, violence and assault was not enough.So, from any woman who has been belittled, threatened, sexually coerced, humiliated or abused by a powerful man: Good riddance, governor.It remains to be seen if resignation is the only consequence you will face.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri's next governor: Mike Parson,"May 30, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-s-next-governor-mike-parson/article_e6b1d813-b3f5-55dc-95fa-59293d4ab0b6.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • In the tumultuous months leading up to Gov. Eric Greitens’ resignation announcement Tuesday, Missouri’s 57th lieutenant governor rarely said a word in public about his possible ascension to the state’s top political office.Aides to Lt. Gov. Mike Parson said it would look tacky for the man who stood next in line to take over as chief executive to weigh in on the scandal that brought down his fellow Republican.He broke his silence on April 13, two days after a bombshell report was issued by a special House committee investigating the circumstances of the governor’s extramarital affair.

In a speech to Boone County Republicans covered by the Columbia Daily Tribune, Parson said, “Everybody in the world wants me to say something. What that is and whatever I say, it is almost a no-win situation. No one elected official, including myself, no statewide official, is larger than the state of Missouri. None.”Parson, 62, was not in the Capitol on Tuesday when Greitens announced his plan to leave office at 5 p.m. Friday.In a statement released by his office Tuesday evening, Parson said:“With Governor Greitens’ decision to resign from office, he has put the best interests of our state and all Missourians at the forefront where they belong. This is a decision that will allow our state to heal and move forward from what has been a difficult time. This is an enormous responsibility serving as our state’s next governor, and I am ready to fulfill the duties of the office with honor and integrity, and with a steadfast commitment to making our great state even greater for the people we are entrusted to serve.”His chief of staff, Ward Franz, said he was unsure whether the farmer from Bolivar had spoken with Greitens before the announcement.Former Gov. Matt Blunt hailed Parson.“I have known Mike for many years and worked with him in the Legislature when I was governor. As a former sheriff, he is a law-and-order leader who will bring that experience to the governor’s office. Mike has always been someone interested in results, no matter who gets the credit and I know he will work well with House and Senate leadership and legislators in both parties to get things done for Missourians,” Blunt said in a statement.Parson once had designs on the job he’ll hold by the end of the week. With term limits looming over his legislative career in 2015, Parson launched a bid for governor, hoping his experience as a sheriff in Polk County and a conservative track record in the House and Senate dating to 2005 would garner support.But, with the GOP primary field growing, he opted in July 2015 to run for the lieutenant governor’s post.First he fended off Kansas City attorney Bev Randles in the primary election and then won 110 of Missouri’s 114 counties in the general election en route to statewide office.Unlike Greitens, who was elected as an outsider, Parson brings a wealth of political experience to the job.He and his wife live in southwest Missouri, where he operates a cow and calf operation. He has two children and five grandchildren.Raised on a farm in Hickory County, Parson graduated from Wheatland High School and then took night courses at the University of Maryland and at the University of Hawaii while he served a six-year stint in the Army.
In the Legislature, Parson sponsored an expansion of the state’s castle doctrine — a law that entitles the use of deadly force in home defense. He also sponsored and backed pro-agriculture measures.Parson also has made higher education a priority, pushing for a building and repair program for public universities and advocated against cuts to the University of Missouri system.Parson’s tenure in the Legislature is expected to change the dynamic in the Capitol. While Greitens spent much of his first year in office poking and prodding at lawmakers, Parson has built relationships with members on both sides of the aisle.“I know what my obligations are if something should ever occur, I knew that in the beginning what they were, you just never thought it was going to happen,” Parson said last week while again visiting Boone County.
Parson has split publicly with the governor on some issues. While Greitens banned people in his office from accepting lobbyist gifts, Parson was accepting gifts.Parson also broke with Greitens over low-income housing tax credits.After the governor’s appointees voted to end the program, which encourages development in poor neighborhoods and is backed by a politically powerful group of developers, Greitens declared “politics as usual” over. Parson disagreed with the move, saying it would hurt rural Missouri.More• Embattled Missouri Gov.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Messenger: Greitens goes out the way he came in, haunted by the specter of dark money","May 30, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/columns/tony-messenger/messenger-greitens-goes-out-the-way-he-came-in-haunted/article_46a32a69-7e37-550b-9071-616a20ed01ef.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • The Missouri Capitol is getting a face-lift.A bronze statue of Thomas Jefferson stands guard over floor upon floor of scaffolding covering the limestone columns and exterior walls undergoing some painstaking cleaning and preservation work.Inside, the government is literally falling apart.

Republican Gov. Eric Greitens announced his resignation Tuesday, unable to bear the weight of the criminal cases, civil lawsuit and impeachment hearings progressing against him.The announcement came at a hastily called news conference at which he turned his back on reporters and walked away without taking questions. Greitens blamed his opponents for waging a monthslong attack on his administration.“The past few months have been incredibly difficult,” he said. “This ordeal has been designed to cause an incredible amount of strain on my family.”Indeed, it has caused much strain. The first governor to ever have his family picture serve as an official portrait, hanging in state office buildings around Missouri, went out without his wife, Sheena, or their two boys, by his side. He was alone, as the other two branches of government closed in.Not quite 17 months into his term, Greitens is going out the way he came in, haunted by the specter of dark money.Earlier in the morning, on the day that would signal a sudden end, Cole County Circuit Court Judge Jon Beetem ruled that Greitens would have to turn over documents from his campaign, and those from his dark-money committee, A New Missouri, to the House committee investigating the governor’s various alleged misdeeds.That committee met on Tuesday, hearing from former Greitens staffer Michael Hafner, who laid out the case that the early days of Greitens’ campaign, in 2014 before he ever filed a campaign committee, might have run afoul of Missouri ethics laws.Hafner’s testimony wasn’t new. He previously spoke to the committee behind closed doors, and was questioned by Attorney General Josh Hawley, who was investigating whether the governor broke the law by taking the donor list from the nonprofit he founded — The Mission Continues — and using it to raise money for his political campaign.One question, though, elicited the sort of answer from Hafner that has had big-money state and national Republicans scared to death about where this investigation might lead. After Hafner discussed the advice he gave Greitens in early 2014, that he should form a committee with the Missouri Ethics Commission as soon as he started spending money on political activities, state Rep. Jeannie Lauer, R-Blue Springs, asked about the nature of the activity of some of the committees that the governor eventually did form.One of them, A New Missouri, is a 501(c)(4) nonprofit organization that hasn’t disclosed its donors like other political action committees. It is this committee that — long after Hafner was no longer working for Greitens — raised most of the governor’s money and continues spending it, in a way that leaves taxpayers in the dark about who is funding the governor’s activities.“What is the purpose of a (c)(4)?” Lauer asked Hafner.He didn’t hesitate:“To conceal the identity of donors.”This is hardly a revelation.Author Jane Mayer wrote a best-selling book on the topic in 2016 called “Dark Money: The Hidden History of the Billionaires Behind the Rise of the Radical Right.” Some of the characters in that book have figured in the rise and fall of Greitens.
National politicians of both major parties have used (c)(4)s and other similar groups to conceal donor identity for years. Plenty of Missouri politicians, too, have moved money from committee to committee to either get around donation limits or allow some donors a certain amount of anonymity, or at least plausible deniability.But nobody played the game with the fervor of Greitens.He did so, Hafner testified, methodically, having a plan to target certain big donors, some of them potentially from other countries, and taking their money in a way that would get around various disclosure laws.“There were conversations we had where foreign money was discussed,” Hafner said on Tuesday.It wasn’t the first time he made such a statement. When he did so previously, in a closed session, Barnes took the information to the FBI, suspecting a potential federal crime.That earned him a verbal lashing from Catherine Hanaway, the former speaker of the Missouri House and U.S. attorney who now represents A New Missouri and the Greitens campaign.
On Tuesday, Hanaway got her comeuppance, as Beetem told Greitens’ committees that they had a couple of days to comply with a subpoena for documents issued by Barnes’ committee.That day — June 1 — will be Greitens’ last as governor of the state.As he began his race, the former Navy SEAL threatened to toss lobbyists down the steps of the Missouri Capitol. Instead, it is his administration and dark-money scheme that came tumbling down.More• Embattled Missouri Gov.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Trouble lurked between the lines of Greitens' perfect story,"May 30, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/trouble-lurked-between-the-lines-of-greitens-perfect-story/article_4cd76e9e-0ff3-58d2-b66d-ce39fc08437a.html,"From the start, Eric Greitens’ story sounded like something from the book jacket of a not-quite-believable political thriller: Handsome young Rhodes scholar-turned-war hero — who also worked with refugees in Rwanda, land mine victims in Cambodia and Mother Teresa in India — goes home and gets elected governor to clean up corruption.But in politics, as in life, things that look too good to be true generally are.Greitens’ stunning rise in politics over the past three years was the culmination of a life of remarkable achievement, including decorated service in the elite Navy SEALs, the founding of a respected national nonprofit and authorship of several best-selling books.

To his many supporters in academia, publishing and among military veterans, a path to a governorship and beyond seemed almost preordained.“Eric Greitens had wrestled with political ambition for most of his life. He sensed it was radioactive, to be handled very carefully,” Time journalist Joe Klein wrote — presciently, it seems now — in his 2015 book “Charlie Mike: A True Story of Heroes Who Brought Their Mission Home.” The book lionizes Greitens as one of those heroes.“[C]ould you run a campaign for Governor of Missouri — as always, Eric’s ambitions were not modest — based on biography and values, rather than platitudes and reflexive attacks?” Klein wrote. “He would show people how he would behave in office, not just tell them.”In hindsight, though, Greitens’ spectacular flame-out over the past five months, ending with his edge-of-tears announcement Tuesday that he is stepping down as Missouri’s governor, was perhaps as preordained as his rise. A potentially combustible flaw of hypocrisy could be glimpsed in the space between Greitens’ words and actions before and during his tenure in office.It’s unsurprising today that a politician would present his picture-perfect family to the voters while cheating on his wife, which we now know was happening during the 2015 launch of Greitens’ gubernatorial campaign. The divorce in his past, and the fact that he’d switched political parties from Democrat to Republican before seeking office, were equally unshocking.But other aspects of Greitens’ Jekyll-and-Hyde political career were less pedestrian.Greitens campaigned on a vow to bring more civility to politics, then was caught on tape seething at a political opponent so angrily that it bordered on physical threat. He chided incumbent politicians for hiding the sources of their campaign funding, while he raised almost $2 million in “dark” money and allegedly made illegal use of fundraising records from the nonprofit he’d founded. After promising to be the most transparent governor in Missouri’s history, he created a shadow funding committee and undertook other actions that have made him one of the most secretive.Those and other issues reported during Greitens’ campaign and his time in office didn’t initially seem to hurt his standing among the public, which tends not to prioritize campaign-funding issues or openness with the press.But Greitens’ personal vilification of his fellow Republicans who control the Legislature — he “poisoned the well,” as one of them put it almost a year ago — ensured that he had no political cover once the spotlight started illuminating his intertwined scandals in January.‘An ideal youth’Before most Missourians had heard of Eric Robert Greitens, he had a specific fan base out there: people who admire military strength and tradition, but with humanitarian goals and a cerebral edge. The kind of people who post Winston Churchill quotes on their cubicle walls, which Greitens reportedly did while in the service.“If ancient Sparta and Athens had teamed up to pick an ideal youth, it would have been someone like Eric Robert Greitens — an athlete, a scholar and a good citizen to boot,” read the beginning of an April 1992 Post-Dispatch story about the high school soccer star’s academic scholarship to Duke University.As a child growing up in St. Louis, Greitens, now 44, was so hyperactive that his mother, a pre-kindergarten teacher, wondered if he had ADHD, because he was “a wild physical creature” who would run in circles in the family’s basement to expend his energy, Klein reported in his book.As Greitens got older, Klein reports, his aggressiveness was conquered by “his inner Obi-Wan,” an acquired calm. It developed under a teacher at B’Nai El congregation who taught the kids “about the desperate lives being lived in the St. Louis ghettos and in the developing world,” Klein’s book says.“He was afflicted by a slightly goofy literalism at times, the sort of kid who actually said that he wanted to be President of the United States,” wrote Klein. “He said it in third or fourth grade, when a teacher asked what he wanted to be when he grew up. ‘I want to be President,’ he said, ‘because I want to help people, and the President gets to help the most people.’”In high school, the future governor who would lead the most media-hostile administration in modern Missouri history penned an essay about the erosion of the First Amendment and called for students to take back their rights: “We need courage and wisdom to stand against the mounting silence and reignite the freedom of expression.”In his 20s, Greitens spent time with refugees in Rwanda and Croatia, which he has said sparked his interest in human rights. In 1993, he was teaching English in China. Because his students talked openly of human rights, Chinese authorities arrested him, he told the Post-Dispatch in 1995.After finishing his career as a Navy SEAL, Greitens created The Mission Continues, an organization that helped veterans transition into civilian life. He stepped down in 2014, and, the next year, he announced his intention to run for governor, after switching his party affiliation to Republican.But his eyes were already set on a higher office. Back in 2009, he’d registered the domain name “EricGreitensforPresident.com.”No goodwill
From the outset of his campaign for governor, despite being a Rhodes scholar and an author, Greitens played up his physicality, particularly his time as a Navy SEAL. An attention-grabbing campaign video showed him firing machine-gun rounds, which brought whispers of aggravation from Missouri’s political class — and from some fellow former SEALs, who frowned on his use of their famously quiet legacy as a political prop.A former Democrat, Greitens rebranded himself as a “conservative outsider” Republican. Once in office, he honed an abrasive tone, ridiculing legislators of his own party on social media when they debated giving themselves a pay raise. The dark-money political committee launched by Greitens’ campaign manager, A New Missouri, posted attack ads publicizing the cellphone number of state Sen. Rob Schaaf, a Republican who had often butted heads with Greitens.Greitens broke with tradition in other ways, bypassing the Capitol press to deliver statements on social media (where he could easily avoid questions) and repeatedly calling lawmakers back to session to push legislation he wanted. At one point, he called legislators “third-graders.”His relationship with lawmakers “really has been a consistent poisoning from really throughout the campaign,” state Sen. Bob Dixon, R-Springfield, told The Associated Press in June 2017, “and it did not change when he came to the building.”By the night of Jan. 10, when Greitens stood before television cameras in Jefferson City and admitted his 2015 extramarital affair, his reserve supply of goodwill among his fellow Missouri politicians was pretty close to empty.Greitens’ acknowledgement of the affair appeared designed to stave off deeper scandals over related issues, since mere infidelity isn’t generally considered a political career-killer these days. “Clearly, he’s done some real damage to his brand, but it’s way too early to write his political obituary,” former Missouri Republican Party Chairman John Hancock said in January.But that was before the dominoes started falling.
When Greitens was indicted Feb. 22 on a felony invasion-of-privacy charge — at the behest of a Democratic St. Louis prosecutor, using a law meant to target peeping Toms — his fellow Republicans didn’t circle the wagons as would normally be expected. Instead, they conducted their own hearings, bringing out explosive testimony from Greitens’ former lover.At the same time, allegations that Greitens had misused a donor list from his charity — allegations that had caused barely a ripple when they were reported in the media months earlier — now were suddenly recast by prosecutors as a second felony charge. The charge was given credence by Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley, a Republican U.S. Senate candidate facing campaign jabs about being too easy on Greitens in an earlier investigation of Greitens’ staff’s use of the disappearing-text app Confide.

Meanwhile, the bizarre revelation that $100,000 in mysterious cash had helped fund the exposure of Greitens’ affair — a story that would normally be expected to draw howls of outrage and demands for investigation from his partisans — elicited neither.“This ordeal has been designed to cause an incredible amount of strain on my family ... to cause maximum damage to family and friends,” Greitens said in his resignation announcement Tuesday — a rare expression of bitterness and defeat from the man whose latest book is entitled “Resilience.”“It’s clear that for the forces that oppose us, there is no end in sight.”Sky Chadde, formerly of the Post-Dispatch, contributed to this report.More• Embattled Missouri Gov.

Eric Greitens spurred a variety of reactions around the state Tuesday afternoon. Here are some of the comments from state and local political leaders:Members of Congress“The governor made the best decision for his family and the state. I look forward to Governor Parson’s leadership and will do everything I can to be helpful.” — U.S. Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo.

“I wish Lieutenant Governor Parson the best. I look forward to working with him.” — U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill D-Mo.“Gov. Eric Greitens has made the right decision for his family and for the State of Missouri.” — U.S. Rep. Ann Wagner, R-Ballwin“I have been disturbed by the allegations surrounding Governor Greitens over the past few months. This has been a distraction for our entire state and undermined his ability to lead.” — U.S. Rep. Blaine Luetkemeyer, R-St. Elizabeth“Now let’s show them we can all work together for our citizens moving forward.” — U.S. Rep. Billy Long, R-SpringfieldStatewide elected officials“Governor Greitens has done the right thing today. I wish incoming Governor Mike Parson well, and stand ready to assist him in his transition.” — Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley“Corruption in state government became worse than ever under Eric Greitens. That corruption must be cleaned up, and our state’s reputation must be restored. This can only happen if leaders put the needs of Missourians ahead of themselves.” — Missouri Auditor Nicole Galloway“Now is the time for the people of Missouri to come together and work toward a better future for our state.” — Missouri Treasurer Eric SchmittState lawmakers“The people of the 74th district and throughout the state deserve a Missouri as good as its promise.

Missourians deserve to know what laws were broken, what lies were told, and how deep the corruption went.” — Gina Walsh, D-Bellefontaine Neighbors“Today’s resignation of Eric Greitens was long overdue. This troubling time for our state was only made worse by the governor’s repeated attempts to avoid justice and blame his victims.” — Sen. Jamilah Nasheed, D-St. Louis

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Blunt: Greitens 'made best decision for his family and the state',"May 29, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/blunt-greitens-made-best-decision-for-his-family-and-the/article_92304162-e8f3-54ad-9daa-b7dc81df83bf.html,"WASHINGTON • Reaction to Gov. Eric Greitens' resignation from other Missouri politicians was immediate, with fellow Republican and United States Sen. Roy Blunt saying ""the governor made the best decision for his family and the state.""""I look forward to Gov. (Michael) Parson's leadership and will do everything I can to be helpful,"" Blunt said in a statement issued by his office just minutes after Greitens' stunning announcement. He was referring to Lt. Gov. Mike Parson, who will take over the governorship after Greitens resigns, effective on Friday. Rep. Blaine Luetkemeyer, R-St. Elizabeth, said that he had been ""disturbed by allegations surrounding Gov. Greitens over the past few months.

""This has been a distraction for our entire state and undermined his ability to lead,"" Luetkemeyer said. ""I am hopeful we can quickly put this behind us and Missouri can move forward under new leadership.""Rep. Ann Wagner, R-Ballwin, echoed her colleagues, saying that Greitens made the right decision for Missouri and for his family, and that ""now is the time for us to move forward."" Blunt had not called for Greitens' resignation, but his Senate colleague, Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., had. But McCaskill reacted more cautiously in the immediate aftermath of Greitens' resignation, not referring to Greitens at all in a statement issued by her office.""I wish Lt. Gov. Parson the best,"" McCaskill said. ""I look forward to working with him.""Rep. William Lacy Clay, D-St. Louis, would have no immediate comment, his spokesman, Steve Engelhardt, told the Post-Dispatch. Greitens' announcement sparked immediate, and harsh, comment from outside groups attempting to influence Missouri's Senate race.McCaskill is up for re-election in November, and Attorney General Josh Hawley, a Republican who had also called for Greitens to resign, is the leading GOP contender to face her.Chris Hayden, a spokesman for the Democrats' Senate Majority PAC, again called on Hawley to refund $50,000 in donations from Greitens' political committees that Hawley received for his successful 2016 attorney general's race. He said Greitens' resignation won't stop his group from arguing that Hawley was late in investigating allegations against the governor.
But Bob Salera, a spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, a GOP group expected to also spend heavily in Missouri's Senate campaign, said Greitens' resignation will remove a distraction from voters being able to focus on McCaskill's ""abysmal voting record.""""McCaskill has been desperate to change the subject, but no distractions from her or anyone else is going to change that,"" he said.More

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Editorial: With governor's resignation, a long-awaited end to the Eric Greitens myth","May 29, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-with-governor-s-resignation-a-long-awaited-end-to/article_955ba636-462c-55aa-8492-85e0601f12e5.html,"Gov. Eric Greitens has finally put an end to the sham that was his 17-month term in office. He should have resigned long ago — for the sake of the “forgotten” Missourians he cynically claimed to serve. But the truth is, Greitens could never allow his own political ambitions to take a back seat to any other interest.Even as he resigned in disgrace Tuesday, Greitens still couldn’t bury his massive ego as he tried to get in a few extra jabs at unnamed enemies who, he suggested, had plotted against him. Let the record be clear: There was no plot, no group of nefarious evildoers who had set out to drag down this mythical defender of freedom and righteousness. The only person responsible for the governor’s downfall was Eric Greitens.Had Missouri voters known in November 2016 about the sordid extramarital affair that got Greitens into so much trouble, he never would have gotten out of the starting blocks. His generous dark-money funders would have sprinted to back more worthy candidates.

Greitens persists in trying to sell the same myths upon which he built his gubernatorial bid from the early days of 2015.Myth 1: He was a devoted family man and ex-Navy SEAL who had dedicated his life to defending America. In fact, Greitens was a military short-timer who reneged on his commitment to the SEALs once he caught the scent of political opportunity.
Myth 2: He was in this to “fight for the people of Missouri.” Greitens always had his eyes on higher public office, made painfully obvious by his overzealous dark-money fundraising and his reservation of a presidential campaign website well before he had won the gubernatorial election. Greitens was in this fight for Greitens.
In his resignation remarks, he alluded to unnamed enemies out there who somehow “designed” the extramarital-affair scandal “to cause maximum damage to my family and friends” — as if Greitens had been a devoted family man victimized by powerful forces beyond his control. His strategy has consistently been to dismiss as “tabloid trash gossip” and “lies and falsehoods” the serious allegations against him instead of accepting his personal responsibility for the damage he caused.Greitens accused those unnamed enemies of engaging in “endless personal attacks designed to cause maximum damage to family and friends. … It’s clear that for the forces that oppose us there is no end in sight. I cannot allow those forces to continue to cause pain and difficulty for the people that I love.”Finally, the state can move forward. The low-profile Republican lieutenant governor, Mike Parson, now must scramble to establish his own political agenda and acquire the leadership skills required of the state’s highest officeholder. Luckily, he doesn’t have a hard act to follow."
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Greitens-led effort to shrink government falls short,"May 25, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/greitens-led-effort-to-shrink-government-falls-short/article_c693d7c3-1702-5e8d-bd85-6fec7235c63f.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Gov. Eric Greitens’ bid to shrink government fell far short of the goals set by a panel he appointed last year.Under legislation heading toward the Republican’s desk, state lawmakers approved a plan to eliminate or merge 25 boards and commissions, resulting in 138 fewer appointments that Greitens would be responsible for filling.A special task force appointed by the governor, which spent six months last year studying the issue, had called for the reduction of 450 gubernatorial appointments.

Despite falling short of the recommendation, a spokeswoman for the chairman of that panel, Lt. Gov. Mike Parson, said he was pleased with the legislation.“He does, however, still believe more consolidation can be done with boards and commissions and duties combined,” said Kelli Jones.Greitens’ spokesman, Parker Briden, said the office would not comment on the specifics of the legislation until it is given a full review.But, he added, “We’re glad that the Legislature made progress on this important issue this year.”There are more than 200 boards and commissions in Missouri. Some ensure public safety and health. Others promote Missouri products or administer professional certifications.
As governor, Greitens has the responsibility of appointing people to boards that create regulations for clean water, interior designers, real estate agents and a host of other industries and professions.Greitens’ call for streamlining followed former Gov. Jay Nixon’s decision to cut more than 70 boards and commissions — and his reduction of the state’s workforce by more than 5,100 employees — during his eight-year tenure.
An estimated 1,200 of the positions on the state’s boards are vacant because they were not filled by Nixon, a Democrat, or his predecessor, Republican Matt Blunt.According to the task force report, 5 percent of state panels don’t have a quorum, vacancies are common and more than 75 percent of the panels have members serving expired terms, which is allowed under state law.Among the boards targeted for elimination or merger are the Unmarked Human Burial Consultation Committee, the Advisory Commission for Dental Hygienists and the Task Force on the Prevention of Sexual Abuse of Children. The duties of the boards will be shifted to other oversight commissions or be monitored by state agencies.Among the boards that were targeted by the panel that survived the legislative process were the Holocaust Education and Awareness Commission, the State Milk Board and the Hispanic Business, Trade and Culture Commission.The legislation is Senate Bill 843.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Editorial:  Missouri's GOP leaders need to stand up for Missouri values,"May 8, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-missouri-s-gop-leaders-need-to-stand-up-for/article_acccced2-bb88-560c-9edd-6fbd1955c76c.html,"Missouri’s top Republican, Sen. Roy Blunt, made an appearance on CNN’s “State of the Union” show Sunday morning with the apparent intention of avoiding serious comment on the hottest story affecting his home state. The way Blunt tap-danced around host Jake Tapper’s questions about Gov. Eric Greitens, the senator must have thought he was on “Dancing with the Stars.”As the state’s senior GOP office holder, Blunt owes his party more than political expediency. Aside from Greitens and Blunt, four other Republicans hold statewide elected office. Of the four, only Attorney General Josh Hawley — one of the investigators into the governor’s many alleged transgressions — has summoned the political courage to tell Greitens to step aside.Give Lt. Gov. Mike Parson a pass because he stands to move up if Greitens goes. But like Blunt, Attorney General Jay Ashcroft and Treasurer Eric Schmitt are profiles in wishy-washiness.

Blunt said the legal and legislative process should play out. Tapper asked him what his gut told him. Blunt went full Fred Astaire:“Well, my gut tells me, when people elect somebody as governor, particularly people, when they elect somebody as governor who spent his whole time running for office talking about how bad the current politicians were of both parties, that you need to let the process work its way out before you reverse what the people have done.”
Blunt danced a little more: “I don’t think we know everything we need to know yet. But I do think we know enough to be very concerned about what we do know.”
Out in Franklin County, 88-year-old Bill Miller, who has known Missouri politicians since Harry S. Truman and U.S. Rep. Clarence Cannon, is a big Roy Blunt fan. Miller is the editor and publisher of the Washington Missourian, and he figures Blunt is “just playing the party line.”The Missourian is a biweekly with a reputation as a Republican paper, but Miller prefers the label “independent.” Miller endorsed Mitt Romney for president in 2012 but skipped the Donald Trump-Hillary Clinton race in 2016 because he didn’t like either candidate. He reluctantly endorsed Republican-turned-Democrat Chris Koster for governor in 2016 because he found Greitens woefully ignorant of state government. Besides, he said, “He’s the biggest phony I’ve ever met in politics.”Three days after Greitens’ troubles surfaced in January, Miller wrote an editorial headlined “Hoodwinked” calling for Greitens to resign. GOP politicians like Blunt, Schmitt and Ashcroft should realize that Bill Miller and his newspaper speak to what Blunt likes to call “Missouri values,” those of the common-sense center.Last week Miller again wrote about Greitens, calling him “an embarrassment to the party,” and asking, “How much longer do Missourians have to put up with a man who allegedly violated laws on the way to the governorship? He should resign — now.”"
Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,St. Louis-area Democrats among those who didn't sign special session petition,"May 4, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/st-louis-area-democrats-among-those-who-didn-t-sign/article_f0dc09b7-12da-5a18-979f-d89efed2600d.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • While a strong majority of the House and Senate agreed to a special session to consider impeaching the governor, a smattering of Republicans and Democrats did not add their names to the effort.In the Senate, three Republicans and one Democrat did not sign the petition for the special session, which is scheduled to start May 18 and last 30 days.In the House, 16 Republicans and seven Democrats, including several from the St. Louis area, were holdouts.

The four senators who didn’t sign the petition are:Sen. Dan Brown, R-RollaSen. Brian Munzlinger, R-WilliamstownSen. Wayne Wallingford, R-Cape GirardeauSen. Maria Chappelle-Nadal, D-University CityNone — including Chappelle-Nadal, who said Lt. Gov. Mike Parson would be worse than Gov. Eric Greitens — has called on the governor to resign, according to the Columbia Missourian.The House members are:Rep. Rick Brattin, R-HarrisonvilleRep. Wanda Brown, R-LincolnRep. Gary Cross, R-Lee’s SummitRep. Paul Curtman, R-WashingtonRep. Chris Dinkins, R-AnnapolisRep. Lyndall Fraker, R-MarshfieldRep. Keith Frederick, R-RollaRep. Mike Kelley, R-LamarRep.

Joshua Peters, D-St. LouisRep. Clem Smith, D-Velda Village HillsAll of the Republicans who didn’t sign have either not commented on the governor’s situation or have advocated waiting until Greitens’ trial in St. Louis Circuit Court on felony invasion of privacy charges has finished. Of the Democrats, only Butler, Ellington and Newman have publicly said Greitens should resign.Chappelle-Nadal said that, although she had been critical of Greitens, she believed his trial should play out before any decisions should be made.“You still have a right to due process,” she said, adding that, in her view, the situation mirrored that in Washington at the moment. “I don’t want to see a governor like Parson. People at home say, ‘We can’t stand (President Donald) Trump, but (Vice President Mike) Pence would be worse.’ ”She said that, on a “human level,” she could relate to what the governor might be going through: After she said on Facebook that Trump should be “assassinated” and the Senate censured her, she felt isolated.
“I know what it means to have everyone out to get you,” she said.Ellington said the process to impeach the governor should have already begun, based on Greitens’ being charged with two felonies.“If the body really felt that the charges were as serious as their political posturing,” he wrote in a statement posted to Twitter, “then why are we not dealing with the issue during regular session?”
Others approached the situation from a different angle.Spencersaid the people he represented were telling him the efforts to possibly impeach Greitens were a “railroad job.”“My constituents in my area told me the special session was a waste of taxpayer dollars,” he said. “They’re not happy elected officials are taking away their vote.”Rehder said she needed to hear Greitens’ side before considering next steps.“We must not lose sight of our American judicial system,” she said in a statement. “Both parties will be heard in court starting next week.”Newman said she would have signed the petition but was out of town for medical reasons.Butler said he would have signed but was indisposed.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Where he got the $50k is only the latest question surrounding newspaper publisher Scott Faughn,"May 2, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/where-he-got-the-k-is-only-the-latest-question/article_226bb997-9943-53fe-bcf9-16bdfcd43551.html,"ST. LOUIS • Scott Faughn, the Missouri newspaper publisher who gave $50,000 in cash to the lawyer who helped break open the scandal now engulfing Gov. Eric Greitens, has a history of playing different, often conflicting roles: mayor, journalist, political activist, even convicted felon.But Faughn, 38, has been consistent about one thing in the past few years: his dislike of Greitens.“When I first met the Governor, something in my sizable gut detected a certain lack of authenticity,” Faughn wrote recently in his political newspaper, the Missouri Times, adding to his long-standing criticism of Greitens’ use of dark money, his attacks on tax credits and his conflicts with fellow Republicans. “It just seemed odd to go from well-tailored suit-wearing Obama supporter in 2008 to the most right-wing of right-wingers dressed in jeans and work boots a few years later.”
















        
            Post-Dispatch coverage of the Greitens affair scandal

From Greitens' initial statement to the legal battle, read the Post-Dispatch coverage of the governor's scandal. 




Greitens faces a felony invasion-of-privacy charge and calls for impeachment stemming from an extramarital affair which, the woman involved has alleged, included violence and a threat. Greitens also faces a second felony charge for allegedly misusing a charity for political gain.














        
            Post-Dispatch coverage of Greitens, campaign issues and The Mission Continues

Greitens, a former Navy Seal, founded The Mission Continues in 2007. His alleged use of a fundraising list from the charity is under investigation. 




The affair and related allegations first came to light in January, when Clayton attorney Al Watkins, representing the ex-husband of the woman who’d had the affair with Greitens, released an audio recording the man secretly made of his then-wife talking about it.Watkins has since said in a deposition that he received two cash bundles of $50,000 each: one from a courier identified only as “Skyler,” and the other from Faughn.Faughn has been coy about providing details on his role, scheduling and then postponing a radio interview on the issue Tuesday. He didn’t respond to a Post-Dispatch request for an interview Tuesday.He may soon have no choice but to lay it all out, though, as a special Missouri House committee is expected to subpoena him in its ongoing investigation of Greitens.Faughn, barrel-chested and gregarious, first came into the public eye in 2002, as the 22-year-old mayor of his hometown of Poplar Bluff in southeast Missouri. His youthful political career ended with a felony conviction for forging checks to himself from a highway project.His newspaper, the Jefferson City-based Missouri Times, is generally identified with the state’s Republican establishment. That alone somewhat puts Faughn at odds with Greitens.Though he’s a Republican, Greitens has been battling the GOP’s old guard in the state capital since before his 2016 election. With no prior political experience, Greitens won that year in part by vilifying the Republicans who control state government. He has continued that practice as governor.Faughn also is a strong supporter of the lucrative industry that has grown around Missouri’s generous tax-credit system, which Greitens has begun dismantling, suggesting it’s a boondoggle by developers at the expense of the taxpayers.Under that system, the state gives tax incentives for goals like providing low-cost housing and historic preservation, with the developers of those projects taking their profits off the top, often by selling the credits for cash.Last year, Greitens used his board appointment powers at the Missouri Housing Development Commission to cancel the state’s tax credit match for federal low-income housing tax credits, appointing two new commission members right before the meeting. The only votes against it were from state Treasurer Eric Schmitt and Lt. Gov. Mike Parson, a vocal supporter of the state’s tax credit system who will become governor if Greitens is removed.“Parson, Schmitt defend rural Missouri with ‘no’ votes on ending low-income housing tax credits,” read the Missouri Times headline after that vote, over a story that focused primarily on criticism of Greitens’ move.
In addition to publishing the Missouri Times, the Clayton Times and the SEMO Times of Poplar Bluff, Faughn hosts a weekly television show, “This Week in Missouri Politics.” Its sponsors include Sterling Bank of Poplar Bluff, which is involved in low-income housing tax credit projects.Those and other ties between Faughn and the tax credit development industry have led to speculation this week that that industry might have provided the $50,000 that Faughn gave to Watkins.A Sterling Bank official didn’t return a call seeking comment Tuesday. Its lobbyist in Jefferson City, former House Speaker Steve Tilley — who has appeared on Faughn’s show and co-sponsored legislative parties with him — said Tuesday he had “no idea” where the money came from. “You would have to talk to Scott about Scott,” he said.In an off-the-air conversation with KMOX Radio’s Mark Reardon on Tuesday morning, Faughn apparently denied that he was delivering the cash for someone else.“Faughn says that he was the source of the money. He says, ‘It was my money.’ That’s a direct quote,” Reardon told his listeners later in the day. “This was part of an effort to write a book about this.”
Reardon added: “Do I believe that it was his money? I do not.”The notion that Faughn personally provided the money does seem questionable, given his relatively recent financial problems. Just two years ago, Faughn faced legal action over $17,000 in unpaid taxes and other debts related to his newspapers.Faughn is a regular guest on KMOX shows, including Reardon’s show, but he had never mentioned his connection to the Greitens’ legal case before it came out in court.As recently as Friday, Faughn appeared on “Reardon’s Roundtable” on KMOX, participating in discussion about the two $50,000 payments made to Watkins by then-unknown sources, and continuing his criticism of the governor. Faughn didn’t mention that he was responsible for delivering one of them.Journalistic issuesIn addition to any legal issues arising from his entanglements in the Greitens case, Faughn — not for the first time — faces questions about his role as a journalist.“A basic standard of journalism is that you do not participate in the events — the issues — in which you are covering,” said Phill Brooks, an associate professor emeritus at the Missouri School of Journalism who has worked in the Capitol since the early 1970s and works for KMOX Radio.He said the fact that Faughn delivered $50,000 to Watkins — whatever the motive — is “as serious an ethical violation as you can find in American journalism.”“This is a member of our Capitol news association who is engaged in funneling money to an agent involved in trying to oust the governor of the state of Missouri,” Brooks said.The Missouri Capitol News Association is comprised of members of news organizations around the state, and administers office space at the Capitol for its members. The group’s bylaws restrict it to organizations that are “editorially independent of any political party, institution, foundation, lobbying entity or interest group.”The Missouri Times is part of the association, but Faughn’s adherence to its standards has come into question in the past. For example, the Times hosted lobbyist-sponsored parties and, for a time, one lawmaker slept in the publication’s offices, according to a report in the Gateway Journalism Review.Jack Suntrup and Joe Holleman of the Post-Dispatch contributed to this report.

It’s hardly a revelation that folks on Wall Street make big campaign donations with an expectation that they’ll get a return on their investment. But it’s not that often that an insider explains so clearly and without shame that elected officials — some of them anyway — are in on the game.In 2006, Hamra, a Springfield developer and restaurant franchisee, reminded Missouri politicians how he expected the game to be played. That year, after the Missouri Housing Development Commission awarded two of his rivals significantly more lucrative tax credits for low-income housing projects than he received, Hamra protested in a letter to Gov. Matt Blunt.Reminding the Republican governor that he raised more than $400,000 for his campaign, Hamra demanded that the governor “correct this blatant inequity.” Hamra threatened to switch his allegiance to then Attorney General Jay Nixon, if Blunt didn’t have the MHDC do his bidding.Blunt, to his credit, would have none of it.He shared Hamra’s letter with a blue-ribbon panel he appointed to investigate whether the tax credit system — in which developers sell the state tax credits for a discount to finance projects — was a good deal for the state. The panel said it was not. So did successive audits by state auditors of both parties, and a panel appointed by the next governor, Nixon, a Democrat.Last year, Gov. Eric Greitens, a Republican, became the third straight Missouri governor to try to reform the system that a few wealthy developers have controlled for years with well-placed campaign donations to lawmakers. He succeeded where others failed by appointing the biggest tax-credit-critic of all, former state Sen. Jason Crowell, R-Cape Girardeau, to the MHDC, whereby he engineered a vote to award no state tax credits for the coming year, in an attempt to force the Legislature to deal with the issue it has punted for years.This brings us to Albert Watkins.The flamboyant and ever-so-quotable Clayton lawyer represents the ex-husband of the woman with whom the governor had an affair. The governor allegedly took a photo of the half-naked woman without her consent. It was the revelation of audio recordings the ex-husband made of his ex-wife talking about the affair that kicked off Greitens’ legal problems, which now include two felony charges and possible impeachment. Last week, Watkins admitted that an anonymous courier delivered $100,000 in cash to his office around the time the story broke.Greitens and his team pounced, calling the entire controversy a “political hit job.”
There is some truth to that statement. It doesn’t exonerate the governor’s horribly bad predatory behavior, or erase the evidence of his alleged crimes. It likely won’t stop his removal for impeachable acts.But make no mistake: The governor has many enemies — most of his own making — and they are celebrating his demise. Some of them, the evidence suggests, are just reading from Sam Hamra’s playbook.In those 2006 tax-credit hearings, another Springfield developer explained the feelings behind Hamra’s letter.
“People who don’t get projects, or don’t get as many as they would like, are generally unhappy,” Mark Gardner said.Flash forward to August 2017. Greitens appoints Crowell to the MHDC, a signal that change is coming.Later that month, three companies tied to low-income housing tax credits, including Gardner’s, donate thousands of dollars on the same day to four obscure political action committees: Missouri Growth, Missouri Senior, Missouri AG and Missouri C. One month later, prolific political donor Rex Sinquefield gave $18,750 to each of the committees. A month after that, lobbyist Steve Tilley, who controls the Missouri Growth PAC, and represents companies in the tax-credit industry, gave $4,000 to each of the four committees. In March of 2018, Tilley increased his investment, adding $10,000 to each.The committees all have a connection to Tilley, whom Greitens targeted as his foil during his shallow campaign that promised to “blow up” the culture of corruption in Jefferson City. Each of the committees has been paying Tilley’s sister for accounting work, and lobbyist and political consultant David Barklage, who, in effect, was evicted from his Jefferson City office by the governor when one of Greitens’ donors bought the building and turned it into the headquarters of the governor’s dark-money committee, A New Missouri. Tilley and Barklage have both been paid by Lt. Gov. Mike Parson as consultants, and Tilley has been a major Parson donor. Parson would become governor if Greitens were to resign or be impeached.The donations to those four committees since August totals more than $150,000.That money, according to Missouri Ethics Commission records, to the extent they tell the tale, didn’t end up in Watkins pocket. But it’s clearly a sign of various political forces with an ax to grind against the governor using the dark money game perfected by Greitens against him.Maybe it’s poetic justice. Either way, there is a moral to the story.The money matters. It always does.Ask Mick Mulvaney.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Greitens limps along as he lobbies lawmakers; impeachment looms,"Apr 26, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/greitens-limps-along-as-he-lobbies-lawmakers-impeachment-looms/article_7309073c-d8a0-57f9-b3cf-0037de2812f5.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Gov. Eric Greitens, bodyguards in tow, made a rare appearance on the fourth floor of the Missouri Capitol on Wednesday as he met with some of the Republican lawmakers who hold his fate in their hands.Reporters waited outside a fourth floor office and followed Greitens, a Republican, down a stairwell as he headed back to his second-floor office suite. They asked whether he still used a cellphone app that deletes text messages, took a donor list from his charity without its permission, shot a compromising photo of his lover and if he planned to resign.














        
            Post-Dispatch coverage of the Greitens affair scandal

From Greitens' initial statement to the legal battle, read the Post-Dispatch coverage of the governor's scandal. 






He wouldn’t answer.“Why won’t you answer our questions?” a Post-Dispatch reporter asked.“It’s good to see you, sir,” he responded. “It’s very good to see you. I hope you have a wonderful day.”The meetings with lawmakers took place as a secretive Missouri House committee continues to investigate Greitens. House staffers announced Wednesday that the committee had hired on a pro bono basis former Missouri Supreme Court Chief Justice Edward D. “Chip” Robertson Jr. and lawyer Mark Kempton as special counsel.Greitens has refused to resign, even as he battles two felony cases — one alleging invasion of privacy in connection with an affair, the other charging him with computer tampering for taking a charity donor list. The capital city is bracing for potential impeachment proceedings — a possibility that would carry guaranteed fallout, if not all-out political warfare.














        
            Post-Dispatch coverage of Greitens, campaign issues and The Mission Continues

Greitens, a former Navy Seal, founded The Mission Continues in 2007. His alleged use of a fundraising list from the charity is under investigation. 




Greitens’ adversaries in the GOP-controlled Legislature are debating whether and how to dislodge him from office. Leaders have even talked of attempting to use an obscure provision in the state Constitution that allows creation of a “disability board” to decide whether the governor is unable to fulfill his duties.“It’s been discussed, but I’ve not seen a structured plan,” Senate Majority Floor Leader Mike Kehoe, R-Jefferson City, told the Post-Dispatch.Rep. Randy Pietzman, R-Troy, said the governor dropped by Wednesday to talk about building an overpass in his district.“Naturally, I asked him a few questions,” Pietzman said. “Some of them he talked about. Some of them he didn’t. Till the trial comes up, he’s not at liberty to say.“He said he was going to make some rounds today and talk to a few reps, which is good. He needs to get out. He seemed confident.”Hanging onIn a way, Greitens’ refusing to resign is not surprising. The Democrat-turned-Republican, who has long criticized establishment politics, has never adhered to political norms.“This guy doesn’t care about the party, and he doesn’t care about the (conservative) movement,” said Gregg Keller, a Missouri Republican strategist opposed to Greitens, when asked why efforts to get him to step down haven’t worked. “You can’t threaten him with what it’s going to do to the party or the movement.”Under one scenario circulating among legislative leaders, if Greitens is impeached by the House, he could be suspended from his duties by the special board, which would declare him unable to carry out the duties of his office.The so-called disability board would comprise the top two leaders in the House and Senate and all of the statewide officers except for Greitens.If a majority of the board determines that Greitens “is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office,” Article 4 of the Missouri Constitution says, he would be suspended from exercising the duties of his office, but he would still be paid and could live in the governor’s mansion until his case in the Senate is resolved. If Greitens objects, the case would be decided by the Supreme Court, according to the Constitution.A member of House leadership who spoke on the condition of anonymity confirmed that the provision in the Constitution had been discussed. “A lot of people have asked,” the person said.Lt. Gov. Mike Parson, a former state senator from Bolivar and a Republican, would step in as governor if Greitens were suspended.Attorney Ross Garber, an impeachment expert who has been retained by the governor’s office, said that scenario was “completely inapplicable” because Greitens was still able to perform his duties.“There is no argument that the governor is disabled,” Garber said. “An official who is impeached would continue to serve in office.”Senate Minority Leader Gina Walsh, D-Bellefontaine Neighbors, said she wanted to delay sending Greitens any legislation until the impeachment process had run its course.She said the governor should not have the power to pressure lawmakers on the impeachment process by threatening to not sign their bills.
Senate President Pro Tem Ron Richard, R-Joplin, said he was honoring her request.The legislative leaders do not have to send the governor any bills to sign until a May 30 deadline.“He can’t sign ’em unless I sign ’em,” Richard said. “If the minority leader decides that’s in the best interest of the Senate, we will just leave that for another day.”BillboardsAs Greitens attempts to salvage his term, mysterious billboards targeting Greitens critic and state Sen. Rob Schaaf, R-St. Joseph, began popping up last week.The advertisements state that the Darlington Road Corp. purchased them. Nevada records list Las Vegas lawyer Robert P. Spretnak as the president, secretary, treasurer and director of the corporation.A woman who answered the phone at Spretnak’s office said he was out of the country and unreachable. Twenty-year-old news clippings connect Spretnak to the Las Vegas Sands Corp., run by casino mogul and GOP mega-donor Sheldon Adelson.Politico reported in February that Greitens sought help in Las Vegas from Adelson as his legal troubles began to mount.
Andy Abboud, spokesman for Adelson, said “no” when asked if Adelson was behind the billboards.“Absolutely no affiliation whatsoever,” he said in a text message when asked about Spretnak. “Have not heard that name in years.”It is unclear whether the billboards relate to Schaaf’s opposition to dark money, his opposition to the governor, or both. He is term-limited and not running for any other office.Schaaf said anyone who thought billboards would intimidate him was “stupid.” More likely, he said, is that the billboards are meant to intimidate other Republicans.“Don’t be intimidated,” Schaaf said on the Senate floor.Intimidation?Greitens has called St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner a George Soros-backed “liberal prosecutor,” claimed that Attorney General Josh Hawley, a fellow Republican running for the U.S. Senate, was “better at press conferences than the law” and called a House committee investigating him a “witch hunt.”Greitens recently spent $50,000 on a radio ad buy and has roughly $2.5 million sitting in his campaign coffers. Greitens also has a Jekyll-and-Hyde history, maintaining a smiling persona in public and menacing people in private.During the 2016 primary campaign, one of Greitens’ GOP rivals, John Brunner, recorded Greitens without his knowledge.“Oh, John Brunner, oh my God, you are such a weasel! Are you going to meet tomorrow or not?” Greitens said then.GOP senators also said Greitens attempted to intimidate them during private meetings last year. Sen. Jamilah Nasheed, D-St. Louis, called last week or increased security after a House report contained accusations of violence by Greitens and his past use of “violent rhetoric, verbal threats and reliance on firearms and explosives in his commercials.”“It’s a ridiculous notion,” said Jeff Roe, a paid Greitens ally, when asked if threats were leveled.Rep. Phil Christofanelli, R-St. Peters, said he had no knowledge of the governor’s or his allies’ making threats against lawmakers. He did say they felt pressure on multiple fronts: from constituents who are “uncertain” about the allegations; from House leaders who want support as a special committee forges ahead with its investigation; and from Democrats, many of whom want immediate impeachment proceedings.“Those are the three forces that are affecting many, many members of the Legislature,” said Christofanelli, who hasn’t called for Greitens to resign.Rep. Bill White, R-Joplin, who is running for a state Senate seat, said the majority of his Republican constituents still supported Greitens.“They use the word ‘witch hunt’ a lot,” White said Wednesday. “I think (impeachment) is premature.”Sky Chadde of the Post-Dispatch contributed to this report.

Liz Roberts. Roberts, a retired Army veteran, was speaking in a video posted on the website of Missourians for Patient Care, which is seeking to put an initiative on the November ballot to legalize medical marijuana.“I am retired due to a spinal cord injury,” Roberts says, seated in a wheelchair. Medical marijuana, she says, “gives patients like me hope.”

Rogers watched the video and focused immediately on the photo.He has one just like it.Liz Roberts

        It is of the 82nd Special Troops Battalion. Rogers, who lives in Pevely and is a retired disabled veteran, was a platoon sergeant in that unit. The photo was taken in Afghanistan.Liz Roberts isn’t in it. Douglas Roberts is. That’s who Liz was during her eight years in the Army. That’s who served under Rogers’ command.The video that was used to promote a ballot initiative was misleading at best.If this were a simple case of a transgender soldier transitioning after service, Rogers wouldn’t care. But it’s not. The problem is that Roberts’ stories change depending on who she’s talking to, about her gender, about her service, about how she ended up in a wheelchair.So much of what Liz Roberts has told veterans, politicians, reporters and others about her background simply isn’t true.Hers is a case of stolen valor, say two men who served with her when she went by her given name.“She was lying about everything,” Rogers says. “It’s a complete disgrace. I’m embarrassed to say I served with her.”A transition, of sortsLiz Roberts is not transgender. She is not transitioning.That is what she told me in a phone interview early this month.“I’ve been a woman all my life,” she said. “I was one of the first hermaphrodites in the military. The Army changed my sex for me.”There is no evidence that either of those last two sentences is true.Because Roberts identifies as a woman, the Post-Dispatch is using female pronouns to refer to her throughout this story.According to various copies of Roberts’ military records, including her DD 214, the standard record of service issued to a soldier upon discharge, Douglas Duane Roberts served in the Army between 2006 and 2014. Roberts was a rigger — somebody who packed parachutes — who served one tour in Afghanistan. She was retired by the military because of a temporary disability.Roberts’ records say nothing about being born with both male and female genitals or undergoing sex re-assignment surgery. In fact, the Army’s first such gender re-assignment surgery for a transgender soldier was in November 2017, more than three years after Roberts left the military.By then, she was living in Missouri.It was Rogers’ wife, Jen, who drove her here.James Rogers had reconnected with Roberts by Facebook, after hearing from a member of his platoon that Douglas was now going by Liz.“She said she was being mistreated by the VA hospital in Maine, where she was living,” Rogers told me. “She was a soldier of mine, so I opened my home to her.”In March 2017, Jen Rogers and her son drove to Augusta, Maine, to bring Roberts back to live with the family. She told the Rogers family that she was transgender now and was taking estrogen pills in preparation for gender reassignment surgery. She said a motorcycle accident in North Carolina had made her a quadriplegic, which led to her disability retirement from the military.Soon, though, her story, particularly about her medical issues, started falling apart.Jen Rogers was acting as Roberts’ primary caregiver, but when she talked to officials at the VA, they gave her different medical information than Roberts did. After about a week living with James and Jen Rogers, Roberts ended up as a patient at John Cochran Veterans Affairs hospital in St. Louis.A new friendRoberts met John Grady at the VA. Grady, who lives in Wentzville, is a disabled veteran who tries to help other disabled veterans when he can. Grady also is an advocate for medical marijuana, a passion he found he shared with Roberts.“We became friends,” Grady says. “She became almost a part of our family.”Roberts moved in with Grady and his wife, Kara. The Gradys met in the Navy in 1996 at a base in Chicago. They were married within a month. When they met Roberts, they opened their home to her.She spent Christmas with their family. They took her to their farm near Hermann.“We gave her our bedroom,” Kara says. “We slept on the couch.”It didn’t take long for some of Roberts’ stories to raise questions. She told the Gradys the same thing she eventually told The Missouri Times, in a story about her efforts to promote medical marijuana: that she had been injured by an improvised explosive device while serving in Iraq. She told Kara Grady that she was pregnant at the time.Roberts was never in Iraq. She never served as a woman. According to Jen Rogers, who changed the adult diapers that Roberts sometimes wears, Roberts still has male genitals.
“She started saying things that weren’t lining up,” John Grady says.Her stories about Iraq really bothered him. Grady did two tours in Iraq, and Roberts’ stories didn’t match his recollections. She kept talking about being the first woman to serve in various combat situations. At the time, Grady had no idea that Roberts had served as a man, and never in Iraq.So he started checking out her story. He found Rogers, who filled him in.The Gradys broke off their relationship with Roberts.They didn’t plan to tell anybody about what they believe is her “stolen valor,” a term for people who claim military accomplishments they didn’t earn.Then they saw the video.Promoting a causeThe video was posted on the Missourians for Patient Care site, on YouTube and on Roberts’ now defunct Facebook page, the one that had a photo of her with Lt. Gov. Mike Parson.In the description of the video on Facebook, Roberts says she has a master’s degree in aeronautical engineering. She says she is a pilot. Neither is true. “She is now a quadriplegic due to an IED blast she survived while serving her country in 2014,” it says.

Her military records say she wasn’t overseas in 2014.When I talked to her, Roberts told me the blast was in Afghanistan, changing the story she told both the Gradys and The Missouri Times. She said she went to Maine from North Carolina to seek pain relief with medical cannabis. She was inspired to move to Missouri, she says, by the story of retired Sgt. Joshua Lee, founder of Veterans Alliance for Compassionate Access.
Lee is a medical cannabis advocate, well known to the community of veterans and political insiders who for years have been pushing Missouri toward legalization.Roberts now lives with Lee and his wife. Both Lee and Roberts say they were attracted to Missourians for Patient Care because they say it was the best-written proposal among the three groups seeking to get medical marijuana on the November ballot.“Of the various proposals, it would help the most veterans,” Roberts says.Both Roberts and Lee are vague about how they met the organizers of the initiative, but that’s not surprising. Missourians for Patient Care is shrouded in secrecy.In a proposal to donors that I reported on in February, organizers brag that they will keep donor information secret. They have done so, passing donations through a nonprofit organization by the same name that doesn’t have to disclose its donors. That approach led to an ethics complaint filed in March against Missourians for Patient Care.Among the organizers of the group are lobbyist Steve Tilley, a former speaker of the Missouri House; former state Rep. Mike Colona, D-St. Louis; and lobbyist Travis Brown, who runs political firms Pelopidas and First Rule, which are both funded primarily by mega-political-donor Rex Sinquefield, a retired investor living in St. Louis.It was First Rule that shot the video of Roberts.Until last week, it was one of three videos on the Missourians for Patient Care website promoting the initiative. The video was taken down after I started asking questions.More secrecyThe organizers of Missourians for Patient Care won’t answer questions. Neither Brown nor lobbyist Mark Habbas, who has acted as a spokesman, returned emails or phone calls for this column. Colona said in a text that the organization had a policy of making no public statements.Then there’s Mike Kielty.When I started asking Lee and Roberts questions about Roberts’ background, they both protested and said their lawyer would be in contact with me. Nobody called.I asked Lee who the lawyer was and he said: “Mike.” Knowing Kielty was involved in Missourians for Patient Care, I asked if he was the lawyer. No, Lee said, and he sent me the name of a firm that had two lawyers named Mike.When I pressed for more information about Roberts’ background, Lee said he wouldn’t answer any more questions, and sent me Kielty’s phone number.Kielty, a lawyer from St. Charles, is vice president of the nonprofit called Missourians for Patient Care that is raising all the money for the political committee by the same name. The group’s president is John Rallo, a St. Louis businessman who has recently received sweetheart no-bid contracts and land deals from St. Louis County entities after making political donations to County Executive Steve Stenger.Under the Missourians for Patient Care proposal, a board appointed by Stenger would control who received licenses in St. Louis County for marijuana dispensaries and growing operations.Neither Kielty nor Rallo returned phone calls.That doesn’t sit well with the veterans unhappy about Roberts’ videos being used to promote the cause of medical marijuana.“I fully believe that Missourians for Patient Care should have known,” Rogers says.So does Toby Hunt.Hunt, of Tampa, Fla., was Douglas Roberts’ squad leader in Afghanistan.“I’m flabbergasted,” Hunt says. “This organization should have also done the homework; the story changes every time she is asked or taken out of the limelight.”In the end, the various veterans are worried about the damage Roberts has done to multiple groups.“She is doing damage to the medical cannabis movement, the LGBT movement, and disabled veterans,” Kara Grady says. “I don’t get it. We don’t care one iota whether she’s transgender or whatever. We care that she’s lying about why she’s in that chair.”

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Missouri lawmakers asked to sign petition to call themselves in for a special session,"Apr 17, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/missouri-lawmakers-asked-to-sign-petition-to-call-themselves-in/article_47a5dcc3-59bb-5486-8066-eaeaa8402213.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Leaders in the Missouri House began circulating a petition Tuesday in an attempt to allow the Legislature to call itself in for a special session after its scheduled May 18 adjournment. House Speaker Todd Richardson, R-Poplar Bluff, said last week he would seek a special session to consider ""any and all"" disciplinary action a House committee investigating Gov. Eric Greitens might recommend — action that could include impeachment.The state Constitution requires that three-fourths of the members in each chamber sign on in order for a special session to be called. 

Three Missouri House Republicans told the Post-Dispatch on Tuesday afternoon that the process was already underway after Attorney General Josh Hawley said his office had obtained evidence indicating that Greitens may have committed a felony when he allegedly took a donor list from his former charity and used it to raise campaign donations.In a statement Tuesday, legislative leaders called on Greitens to resign in order to spare the General Assembly of having to impeach the 44-year-old chief executive.""Leaders at all levels of government are entrusted with an incredible responsibility to the Missourians we represent. When leaders lose the ability to effectively lead our state, the right thing to do is step aside.  In our view, the time has come for the governor to resign,” noted the letter from Richardson and others in leadership.Senate President Pro Tem Ron Richard, R-Joplin, agreed with the House's move in the wake of Hawley's announcement.""We have reached a critical turning point in the allegations made against the governor. The decisions made going forward will have a significant effect on the state of Missouri. After speaking with the attorney general today, I believe the governor has no other respectable option than to resign from office,"" Richard said. ""Because of the severity of the allegations, it is my wish that we immediately start impeachment proceedings.”Hawley's announcement followed the release last week of a report by the House investigative panel last week which included allegations of violence and sexual misconduct against the governor.Hawley, in his press conference, said Greitens took computer data listing the top donors to The Mission Continues without the consent of the veterans' charity he founded in 2007. He then used the list to raise money for his gubernatorial campaign.The matter has been referred to St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner and to the special House panel investigating whether to recommend impeachment proceedings against the governor.
House Republicans met for nearly two hours in a Capitol hearing room on Tuesday before they headed to the House floor to consider legislation. After the meeting, a Post-Dispatch reporter saw members signing what appeared to be a petition.Later, Adam Crumbliss, the chief clerk of the House, would not show the reporter a copy of the petition, saying that the reporter should file an open records request to view it.The impeachment process starts in the GOP-controlled House and ends in the Senate based on the vote of seven judges appointed by members of the upper chamber.
If the impeachment process begins during the session — and not afterward — it likely would mean little else would move forward in the Legislature this year. The only constitutional requirement facing lawmakers is to get a budget approved for the fiscal year beginning July 1.Meanwhile, the governor made at least one public appearance Tuesday, hosting a meeting of the Board of Public Buildings in his office. Lt. Gov. Mike Parson phoned into the meeting, while the other member of the board, Hawley, was a no-show.It was at least the third time Hawley, who is seeking the GOP nomination for U.S. Senate, avoided sitting down at a table or sharing a stage with the governor amid the ongoing probes.Greitens, a political novice who ran on a platform of cleaning up government, made no comments about the growing scandal and did not stop to answer questions from a reporter after the brief meeting.Under the Missouri Constitution, the governor can be impeached “for crimes, misconduct, habitual drunkenness, willful neglect of duty, corruption in office, incompetency, or any offense involving moral turpitude or oppression in office.”Richard said Greitens actions are being felt throughout the state.""We are past the point of concerning and alarming. Since his time in office, the governor has caused tension, conflict and hostility,"" Richard said. ""It’s time for the governor to find the courage in his heart and do what is in the best interests of the people he serves and step aside.""

She also painted a broader picture of Greitens as a controlling, jealous lover for whom violence or the threat of it was an integral part of the affair.

Read the report from the Missouri House investigation committee. 




Minutes before the report was issued, Greitens denounced the investigation as a “political witch hunt,” using the term five times in about eight minutes. He referred to “lies and falsehoods,” though he didn’t specify which parts of the report he claims are false.In a statement issued later Wednesday by the lobbying firm Greitens has hired to assist his defense, he again said the relationship was consensual.""The accusations published in the House Committee's report will be directly contradicted by the facts that emerge in court. In just 33 days, a court of law and a jury of my peers will let every person in Missouri know the truth and prove my innocence,"" his statement said. House Speaker Todd Richardson, a Republican like Greitens, said he would seek a special session of the Legislature to consider action against the governor — action that may include impeachment.“The testimony outlined in the report is beyond disturbing,” Richardson said. “The power given to the Missouri General Assembly to take disciplinary action or to remove elected officials from office is one of the most serious and consequential powers the Constitution grants the Legislature.”He said the committee would not seek to start impeachment proceedings during the current legislative session, which ends May 18.Attorney General Josh Hawley, another Republican who is conducting a separate investigation of the veterans' charity Greitens founded, called on the governor to resign.“The House Investigative Committee’s Report contains shocking, substantial, and corroborated evidence of wrongdoing by Governor Greitens,"" Hawley said in a statement. ""The conduct the Report details is certainly impeachable, in my judgment, and the House is well within its rights to proceed on that front. But the people of Missouri should not be put through that ordeal. Governor Greitens should resign immediately.”During one encounter in the summer of 2015, the woman testified to the House committee, Greitens struck her and shoved her to the ground as they became intimate in his Central West End home.“And I instantly just started bawling and was just like, ‘What is wrong with you? What is wrong with you?’ ” she told the committee. “And I just laid there crying while he was just like ... ‘You’re fine, you’re fine.’ ”RELATED: Reactions to the House Committee’s report on GreitensDuring another encounter, she alleges, he physically restrained her from leaving his home and insisted she give him oral sex, even though she was crying.Those were among multiple new allegations contained in a 24-page report by the Special Investigative Committee on Oversight, which the Missouri House voted unanimously to form on March 1 after a St. Louis grand jury handed up the felony invasion-of-privacy charge against Greitens.The invasion-of-privacy criminal charge, which is a separate process, followed the revelation in the media in January that Greitens had engaged in an extramarital affair in 2015. Greitens at that time admitted to the affair but denied allegations that he took a non-consensual photograph of the woman and threatened to release it if she ever spoke of their affair.

From Greitens' initial statement to the legal battle, read the Post-Dispatch coverage of the governor's scandal. 




While she was bound and blindfolded during that encounter, she told the committee, Greitens ripped open the T-shirt he’d had her put on and pulled down her pants. She said she then heard noise of a cellphone, “like a picture, and I can see the flash through the blindfold.”“(H)e says, ‘You’re not going to mention my name,’ ” she said. “ ‘Don’t even mention my name to anybody at all, because if you do, I’m going to take these pictures, and I’m going to put them everywhere, and then everyone will know what a little whore you are.’ ”Among other allegations in the woman’s testimony:• When she first came to Greitens’ Central West End home, the former Navy SEAL “shushed” her, went through her purse and patted her down, “I guess to see if I was wearing a wire. ... I’m like, oh my gosh, I guess this is a Navy SEAL thing.”• After snapping the photo, threatening her with exposure and calling her a whore, Greitens “came up close to me and said ‘Are you going to say anything? Are you going to mention my name?’ ... I just didn’t answer at all, and then he spanked me and said, ‘Are you going to mention my name?’ And I ... just gritted through my teeth and said, ‘no.’ ”• After the incident with the photo, she said, she tried to leave the basement, “bawling my eyes out.” Greitens pulled her to the floor in what she described as “bear hug,” trying to calm her down but also continuing to fondle her. “He starts undoing his pants, and he takes his penis out and puts it, like, near where my face is. ... (H)e’s not going to let me leave, because he’s obviously still horny. So I gave him oral sex at this point.”• During a later sexual encounter in Greitens’ bedroom, he asked her if she had slept with anyone in the time since they’d started seeing each other. “I said, ‘Well, I slept with my husband’ ... and he slapped me across the face ... (and) said, ‘What do you mean you slept with your husband? You are not supposed to be sleeping with him.’ “ She said the open-handed slap was hard enough that it “swung my face.”














        
            Read the transcripts of witness testimony to the House Committee

Several witnesses testified under oath before the committee, but not Gov. Eric Greitens. 




When the woman confessed to her husband about the affair, his immediate reaction, she said, was, “I’m going to get this guy one day. I’m going to get him.” Two years later, it was the husband, by then divorced from her, who would bring the allegations to light by leaking to the media an audio tape in which she talks about the affair.Listen to the woman describing the encounter with GreitensGreitens, who took no questions from reporters in his response to the report Wednesday, called the affair at the center of the allegations “a personal mistake.”“This was a private mistake that has nothing to do with governing,” he said. “The people driving this story are part of an absurd political witch hunt.”“The people of Missouri see through this,” he said. “And they know better than to trust one-sided tabloid trash gossip that was produced in a secret report.”The report and reactionLt. Gov. Mike Parson, who would become governor if Greitens leaves office before his term ends, issued a statement calling for unity.“With the recent events that have distracted our great state, I want to say with all sincerity that it is time to unite and put aside our differences,” said Parson, also a Republican. He added: “My heart goes out to the families involved.”Meanwhile, Democratic members of the House committee investigating Greitens said they would continue their work despite the governor’s attacks.“Our committee remains dedicated to its task and will not be deterred by Eric Greitens’ baseless attacks on our witnesses, our integrity or our common sense,” the statement reads. “We remain sympathetic to the victim and the governor’s family for what they are being forced to endure as a result of the governor’s actions and choices.”
Greitens has governed under a cloud since the revelation in January of the affair, with several members of his own party calling for him to resign.The revelations also attracted attention to other matters that Greitens may have to address, including potentially illegal use of assets from his former charity, The Mission Continues, and his use of untraceable political donations to further his career. Transcripts of the committee’s discussions indicate that members are continuing to investigate those issues and will release more about them in a later report.The report hides the name of the woman with whom Greitens had the affair, who is designated “Witness 1.” The Post-Dispatch hasn’t publicly named her because she may be the victim of a sexually related crime and hasn’t agreed to be interviewed.Notably, the committee members — who would be among those determining Greitens’ political future should he face impeachment — conclude in the report that the woman is a “credible witness.” The report also concludes that her account is corroborated by three other witnesses before the committee: her ex-husband and two friends to whom she talked about her encounters with Greitens.Greitens was invited to testify before the committee. His legal team told the committee that the governor would not testify “at this point in time.”“The Committee notes that Greitens has the constitutional right to so decline,” the report states. “To the extent this report does not include Greitens’ perspective, that is the result of his choice not to participate.”Sen. Jamilah Nasheed, D-St. Louis, said the committee findings were “embarrassing.”“It’s horrific. There was no holding back in that report. Very sexual in nature. I just feel bad about it,” Nasheed told the Post-Dispatch. “If he doesn’t step down, the impeachment process should start immediately.”Sen. Jill Schupp, D-Creve Coeur, said that “on a personal level, I continue to be disappointed in the governor,” she said. “And it goes beyond disappointment. This is not a man worthy of the job of governor of this state.”After the report’s release Wednesday, multiple rank-and-file Republican lawmakers declined to comment, while a few others repeated earlier calls for his resignation or impeachment. Republicans hold vast majorities in both the House and the Senate, and Greitens cannot be impeached without many Republican votes to do so.House Minority Leader Gail McCann Beatty, D-Kansas City, said the Legislature should move quickly to remove the governor.
“It is clear to me that this governor must resign and if he fails to do so, I believe we should begin impeachment proceedings,” McCann Beatty said. “We still have five weeks to do the work that we are here to do, and this is probably the most important thing that we could do at this point.”Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., joined the calls for resignation. “It is clearly time to put the interests of the people of Missouri first,” she said in a written statement. “The governor should resign.”Her fellow Missouri senator, Republican Roy Blunt, took a less strident stance. ""The allegations in the report are very concerning,"" he said in an emailed statement late Wednesday. ""As I said previously, both the legislative and legal processes that are underway are appropriate and should continue moving forward."" ‘This perfect guy’The woman’s account of her months-long, tumultuous affair with Greitens includes both salacious and pedestrian details of what started as mild flirtation between a hairdresser and her already quasi-famous client.The woman testified that she met Greitens in 2013, when he was already a bestselling author and the subject of speculation about a future political career. “We got to know each other pretty well, and I thought he was great,” she told the committee. “I thought he was this perfect guy.”Upon his first appointment after a long absence, she said, “I was super nervous because he was one of — you know, really, my only client that I had somewhat of a crush on.”During that appointment, on March 7, 2015, the woman said, Greitens moved his hand up her leg while they were talking.“At first I just ignored it ... and then he, like, moved his hand all the way up to my crotch, at which point I stepped back and was like, ‘What are you doing?’ ”She testified that she continued communicating with him after that because she was separated from her husband, wasn’t sure of the state of his marriage and was “at least curious” about the possibility of a relationship. She suggested meeting publicly for coffee, but he responded that “I cannot be seen in public with you. I’m running for office. People are going to be out to get me, they cannot see me with you,” according to the report.The woman went to Greitens’ Central West End home, through the back door, on the morning of March 21. That is when Greitens shushed her, patted her down and searched her purse, she said.She said she wanted to talk about their relationship, but Greitens said the two “don’t have a whole lot of time,” she said, recalling Greitens’ statements. “Have you exercised today?”“It was like he was on a mission, sort of,” she told the committee. She went ahead and agreed to a workout. She said she walked into a bathroom and changed into clothes Greitens had laid out — a white T-shirt with a slit at the top, and pajama pants. He said he would show her how to do a “proper pull-up.”“I thought this was going to be some sort of, like, sexy workout,” she said.She told the committee he taped her hands to pull-up rings with “this gauzed tape stuff” and blindfolded her.“[H]e kind of had this controlling sort of — again, it was almost as if he had a — like we were on a movie set. ... [H]e was in a controlled state, which at this point was intriguing to me.”She then said he spit water into her mouth, “at which point I realized he’s trying to kiss me, but I don’t even want to kiss him ... So I just spit it out.”Robert Patrick and Sky Chadde of the Post-Dispatch contributed to this story.• EDITORIAL: Amid stories of sexual perversion and abuse, Greitens cannot continue as governor• Highlights of testimony of the woman at center of Greitens affair• Read the House Committee’s report• Read the witness transcripts• Read previous coverage of the scandal• Meet the major players in the Greitens criminal case• Listen to the woman describing the encounter with Greitens

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Legislative report on Greitens expected Wednesday,"Apr 10, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/legislative-report-on-greitens-expected-wednesday/article_1f57b978-8f9b-59b9-9827-d5619f276b40.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • A Missouri House panel investigating Gov. Eric Greitens' 2015 extramarital affair with his hairdresser is set to release its report on Wednesday.The seven-member panel of five Republicans and two Democrats has been meeting behind closed doors since early last month. House members voted unanimously to create the committee — a precursor to possible impeachment proceedings — after a St. Louis grand jury handed up felony invasion of privacy charges against Greitens for allegedly taking and transmitting a non-consensual photo of his lover.Despite calls from Greitens' attorneys to delay the release of the report until after his trial next month, the House committee conducting its own probe of the governor appeared on track to unveil its findings on Wednesday, lawmakers told the Post-Dispatch Monday.

“Nothing has changed. The committee will release a report this week. The committee will also continue working through the end of session,"" said Rep. Jay Barnes, a Jefferson City Republican who is leading the committee.Rep. Gina Mitten, a Richmond Heights Democrat who sits on the committee, said the panel could release additional findings over the next several weeks after members voted last Thursday to extend the committee's existence until May 18.""The committee will continue to investigate, review evidence and take testimony,"" she said.Barnes, who is term-limited and commands respect on both sides of the aisle, has remained relatively tight-lipped about his committee's work, declining to say how many subpoenas the committee has issued and with whom it has spoken.The governor's defense team has been on offense over the last several weeks, trying to derail the committee and St. Louis prosecutors.Greitens' campaign spent $50,000 on a radio ad buy attacking the prosecution. The Washington Examiner recently obtained a letter First Lady Sheena Greitens sent to the House committee that alleges the ex-husband of Greitens' former lover cyberstalked her.And while pleading with the House committee to delay the report roll out, Greitens' attorneys have also released choice snippets of information which raise doubts about St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner's case. Greitens' defense team on Monday said in court filings that St. Louis prosecutors withheld evidence from defense attorneys which calls into question whether Greitens took a photograph of his lover during a March 15 encounter in his basement. The defense deposed the woman for eight hours on Friday, and she could not say under oath that she saw a phone.""I don't know if it's because I'm remembering it through a dream or I — I'm not sure, but yes, I feel like I saw it after it happened, but I haven't spoken about it because of that,"" she said, according to the filing.Also unknown is the degree to which legislative leaders are receiving pressure from Missouri's GOP donor base to delay release of the report.Rep. Glen Kolkmeyer, R-Odessa, who is the House GOP caucus chair, said no one has contacted him about delaying the report.
""No one has put any pressure on me one way or another. We're just waiting on the report to see what facts are there,"" Kolkmeyer said.Political consultant Scott Dieckhaus, a former member of the House, said the rank-and-file members he represents are asking him how they should be reacting publicly to the revelations. But, he doesn’t think they are being subjected to pressure from donors to delay the report.“I don’t recall a whole lot of pressure,” Dieckhaus said. “It could be happening, but I think it is more likely happening with House leadership.”House Speaker Todd Richardson, R-Poplar Bluff, did not return a phone call on Monday. Nor did House Speaker Pro Tem Elijah Haahr of Springfield or Majority Floor Leader Rob Vescovo of Arnold.
Greitens' roleThe first-term Republican governor, meanwhile, has been attempting to carry on with his work amid the scandal, but he has been unable to shunt the cascade of controversy.One attendee at a GOP dinner in Macon County last Thursday described Greitens' presence at the event as ""surreal.""""The crowd kept from rolling their eyes — they were very polite — but they understood the situation,"" said Rep. Nate Walker of Kirksville, who has called on Greitens to resign and is running for state Senate. ""It was kind of a surreal feeling, but once the governor left, everybody kind of went back to normal.""Greitens, who turns 44 Tuesday, has signed two pieces of legislation sent to him by lawmakers. He has issued announcements about new jobs and has appointed people to various boards, commissions and judgships.Last week, Greitens appeared at an event for firefighters in the Capitol rotunda, but he did not speak with reporters.He also held a meeting in his office of the Board of Public Buildings, which consists of Greitens; Attorney General Josh Hawley, a Republican; and Lt. Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican.Greitens was the only member to show in-person, so the committee adjourned without taking action.Though Greitens has regularly shrugged off questions from the media, he has largely stayed out of reach of reporters since revelations about his extramarital affair came to light.He would not answer questions from a Post-Dispatch reporter last Thursday.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,Jefferson City braces for secret committee's release of Greitens report,"Apr 6, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/jefferson-city-braces-for-secret-committee-s-release-of-greitens/article_55b77ca1-a6cc-5538-aa6b-5865b5df2e95.html,"JEFFERSON CITY • Legislators cleared out of the Capitol on Thursday, the end of their workweek, leaving the public with one massive cliffhanger in advance of the weekend.What would a report by a Missouri House committee meeting in secret to investigate Gov. Eric Greitens contain?“Right now I think people are trying to get as much legislation passed before the next two weeks — because they don’t know if all hell’s going to break out,” Sen. Jamilah Nasheed, D-St. Louis, said before the Senate adjourned Thursday.

House members voted unanimously last month to establish a special committee to investigate Greitens — a precursor to possible impeachment proceedings. The resolution forming the committee stipulated that the report be completed Sunday, making the expected date of release Monday.House Minority Leader Gail McCann Beatty, D-Kansas City, told reporters she was confident the release of the report would be delayed, at least temporarily. House Speaker Todd Richardson, R-Poplar Bluff, assured reporters in an emailed statement that the report would be released when finished.The chairman of the committee, Rep. Jay Barnes, R-Jefferson City, said in an email: “Our committee will issue a report next week.”














        
            Lawmaker overseeing Greitens probe says 'no' to request for delay

“The committee is on track,” said Barnes, R-Jefferson City. 




On Wednesday, Barnes offered an emphatic “no” when asked if the panel would delay the release of its report.Thursday’s statements came after Greitens’ legal team sent a letter to the special committee — made up of five Republicans and two Democrats — asking that the release of the report be delayed in part because it could influence the jury pool ahead of Greitens’ May 14 trial in St. Louis for felony invasion of privacy charges.Barnes and Richardson gave no reason for the apparent delay. McCann Beatty said she did not know why the report would probably not be released on time. The resolution forming the committee states that the committee can extend its timeline, but it was unclear Thursday afternoon whether committee members had officially done so.Greitens, a Republican, has been under a microscope since a St. Louis television station reported in January that before he was elected governor he had an extramarital affair with his hairdresser and may have threatened her with a compromising photograph.Since then, other questions about the governor have swirled, such as whether he illegally used assets from the charity he founded, The Mission Continues, to boost his career as a politician and author.On Thursday, a spokeswoman for Attorney General Josh Hawley, a Republican, said that Hawley’s office had issued a “civil subpoena” to Greitens through his company, The Greitens Group. Hawley launched his own investigation of The Mission Continues last month.“We have issued a civil subpoena to the Greitens Group. Eric Greitens is the registered agent for the Greitens Group, and Eric Greitens has accepted service of the subpoena through his counsel,” spokeswoman Mary Compton said in a statement.Hallway chatterRep. Robert Cornejo, R-St. Peters, told the Post-Dispatch on Thursday that he had seen a copy of some kind of letter being circulated among House members indicating that the release of the report should be delayed.

From Greitens' initial statement to the legal battle, read the Post-Dispatch coverage of the governor's scandal. 




Cornejo said he wasn’t sure whether an associate of the governor or one of his House colleagues was circulating the document.“It just talked about where we were at in the process as far as whether it would be prudent for the House investigative committee to request some more time to allow them to gather more facts,” he said, adding that he had not been asked to sign it.Since the committee’s formation, details on the investigation have been scarce. Barnes said during a briefing last month that the committee had issued “some subpoenas” and had interviewed “a number” of witnesses, but he would not get into specifics.Rep. Jean Evans, R-Manchester, said her colleagues were filled with “apprehension” in advance of the report’s release, wondering how salacious the contents of the report would be.
“You don’t want to read about your governor like it’s a cheap novel,” Evans told the Post-Dispatch, “so I think people are apprehensive.”

“I’m sure there’s a lot of angst waiting for that report,” said Senate President Pro Tem Ron Richard, R-Joplin. “We’ll see what happens.”Greitens has not been interviewed by the House committee, his attorneys have said. In a letter to the committee delivered last week, his attorneys asked the panel to delay release of its findings until after a May 14 trial in St. Louis, at which Greitens faces felony invasion of privacy charges.The attorneys worried that the release of the report could influence the jury pool.In addition, the letter said the report would “disseminate incomplete, false and misleading information that will cause damage to entirely innocent people, some of whom are families and children.”Among the attorneys signing the letter was Ross Garber, a Washington-based lawyer who has represented three governors in impeachment proceedings: Robert Bentley of Alabama, Mark Sanford of South Carolina and John Rowland of Connecticut.
Greitens emergesGreitens emerged on Thursday to hold a meeting of the Board of Public Buildings in the governor’s office. The board issues bonds and consists of three members: Greitens; Hawley; and Lt. Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican.

But only Greitens showed to the public meeting. Hawley phoned in, and Parson was gaveling in the Senate at 10 a.m. when the meeting was called to order.Because only one of the members was present, the board adjourned without taking any action. After the meeting, a Post-Dispatch reporter asked Greitens if he would answer a few questions.“No,” Greitens said.Was he sure?“Yes,” Greitens said.The reporter then asked whether Greitens was worried his campaign’s recent $50,000 ad buy going on the offensive against St. Louis prosecutors would taint the jury pool.Greitens breezed by without answering the question. His spokesman, Parker Briden, shooed away the reporter.The advertisement states in part that liberals are “hell-bent on stopping his conservative reforms.” The ad even invokes Satan, noting a 2017 lawsuit by the Satanic Temple in which the group challenges Missouri’s abortion laws.“Even Satan’s own lawyers from the Satanic Temple are suing Greitens,” the advertisement says.Greitens was scheduled to appear at a Republican Party event in Macon County Thursday night.

Mike,Parsons,MO,St. Louis Post Dispatch,"Messenger: After Greitens targets The Satanic Temple, a lecture on the moral high ground follows","Apr 2, 2018",https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/columns/tony-messenger/messenger-after-greitens-targets-the-satanic-temple-a-lecture-on/article_a13ef3e5-d9f1-57b3-bf84-55e501d913aa.html,"First, he blamed Democrats.When news broke in January that Gov. Eric Greitens had hidden an extramarital affair from voters for more than two years and may have broken the law by taking a seminude photo of the woman, the Republican lashed out at the former chairman of the Democratic Party in Missouri, Roy Temple.Within days, the former Navy SEAL set his sights on some new targets.

Greitens and his dwindling band of supporters blamed Republicans, including Lt. Gov. Mike Parson. They blamed developers. Lobbyists. Political consultants. A “reckless” prosecutor. The liberal media. George Soros.This week, it’s Satan’s turn.How convenient.The embattled governor is facing a criminal investigation in the city of St. Louis, a fact-finding inquiry by a State House committee that could lead to impeachment, an investigation by Attorney General Josh Hawley into the governor’s relationship with his former nonprofit, The Mission Continues, and an ongoing lawsuit over his potential violation of open records laws by using a phone app that destroys text messages.As pressure builds for him to resign, Greitens’ campaign bought about $50,000 worth of radio ads in Missouri to defend his name by blaming a new demon for his downfall.Like the Church Lady from “Saturday Night Live” fame, the governor has found his foil.“Even Satan’s own lawyers from The Satanic Temple are suing Greitens,” the ad’s narrator says.From what I remember from the 1997 movie “The Devil’s Advocate” starring Al Pacino, Satan’s lawyers were pretty good.But in real life, Lucifer doesn’t have his own law firm.In fact, those who belong to The Satanic Temple don’t actually worship the Christian version of Beelzebub. They are nontheistic secularists mostly, says Lucien Greaves, the Salem, Mass.-based co-founder and spokesman for The Satanic Temple.
“We don’t believe in a personal Satan,” Greaves told me Thursday. “We do believe that everybody should take responsibility for their own actions.”That last statement was a not-so-veiled shot at Missouri’s governor.Greaves said it’s ridiculous that Greitens is trying to take advantage of the fact that The Satanic Temple has sued Missouri over an anti-abortion law, alleging that the law’s requirement that women read a pamphlet stating that life begins at conception violates their religious beliefs.
“Our lawsuit isn’t about attacking the character of the governor,” Greaves says. “It’s about asserting our religious liberty in the face of a policy dispute.”But about that character.Now that his organization is being used by Greitens to somehow rally support for the governor, Greaves has a few things he’d like to get off his chest.“He can’t blame anybody but himself (for his problems),” Greaves says. “This is some pretty low-level pandering. He’s trying to position his current troubles as part of an over-arching conspiracy against him. He’s lost the moral high ground to anybody who actually looks at the facts, and he tries to regain it by asserting moral superiority against The Satanic Temple.”For the record, Greaves doesn’t necessarily have a problem with Greitens having multiple sexual partners while he was married. His organization’s commitment to individual liberty means that “poly-amorous relationships” are not necessarily out of bounds.But that respect for individual liberty goes both ways, Greaves says. The crime with which Greitens is charged — invasion of privacy for taking a photo without consent — well, that wouldn’t be accepted in The Satanic Temple.“That’s well outside of any activity we would condone,” Greaves said. “The people of Missouri deserve better.”So there you have it. The co-founder of a religion named after a fallen angel says his organization has staked out higher moral ground than the governor of Missouri.Isn’t that special.
